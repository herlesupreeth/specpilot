In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR and NB-IoT operation in NR in-band Base
Station (BS) *Type 1-C* and *Type 1-H*. These have been derived from,
and are consistent with the conducted requirements for *BS Type 1-C* and
*BS Type 1-H* in NR BS specification defined in TS 38.104 \[2\].

A *BS type 1-C* only has conducted requirements so it requires
compliance to this specification only.

A *BS type 1-H* has both conducted and radiated requirements so it
requires compliance to the applicable requirements of this specification
and TS 38.141-2 \[3\].

*BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* have only radiated requirements so they
require compliance to TS 38.141-2 \[3\] only.

====================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1
of this specification, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1. The
frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of
TS 38.104 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.104 \[2\] and the references
therein. Test Tolerances for the conducted test requirements explicitly
stated in the present document are given in annex C of the present
document.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

For *BS type 1-H* when a requirement is applied per *TAB connector* then
the test uncertainty is applied to the measured value. When a
requirement is applied for a group of *TAB connectors* then the test
uncertainty is applied to sum of the measured power on each *TAB
connector* in the group.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545
\[4\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this
may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure
that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1.2 had
been used.

4.2 Conducted requirement reference points
------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 *BS type 1-C*

*BS type 1-C* requirements are applied at the BS *antenna connector*
(port A) for a single transmitter or receiver with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If
any external apparatus such as an amplifier, a filter or the combination
of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far end *antenna
connector* (port B).

Figure 4.2.1-1: *BS type 1-C* transmitter interface

Figure 4.2.1-2: *BS type 1-C* receiver interface

### 4.2.2 *BS type 1-H*

*BS type 1-H* requirements are defined for two points of reference,
signified by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.

Figure 4.2.2-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *BS type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
*operating band* specific radiated interface is referred to as the
*Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which
the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

NOTE: Radiated conformance requirements are captured in TS 38.141-2
\[3\] and are out of scope of this specification.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

4.3 Base station classes
------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated.

BS classes for *BS type 1-C* and 1-H are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
70 dB.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals
to 53 dB.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
45 dB.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

4.5 BS configurations
---------------------

### 4.5.1 *BS type 1-C*

#### 4.5.1.1 Transmit configurations

##### 4.5.1.1.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics in clause 6 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full
complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
conditions. If any external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter
or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the
far end antenna connector (test port B).

Figure 4.5.1.1.1-1: Transmitter test ports

##### 4.5.1.1.2 Transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each transmitter *antenna
connector* in the case of transmission with multiple transmitter
*antenna connectors*.

Transmitter requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the
remaining *antenna connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer
has declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent (D.32), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the transmitter *antenna
connectors*.

#### 4.5.1.2 Receive configurations

##### 4.5.1.2.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics in clause 7 are
specified at the BS *antenna connector* (test port A) with a full
complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
conditions. If any external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter
or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the
far end *antenna connector* (test port B).

Figure 4.5.1.2.1-1: Receiver test ports

##### 4.5.1.2.2 Reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, receiver diversity

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receiver *antenna connector* for receivers with antenna
diversity or in the case of multi-carrier reception with multiple
receiver *antenna connectors*.

Receiver requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the
remaining receiver(s) disabled or their *antenna connector(s)* being
terminated. If the manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be
equivalent (D.32), it is sufficient to apply the specified test signal
at any one of the receiver *antenna connectors*.

For a *BS type 1-C* supporting multi-band operation, multi-band tests
for ACS, blocking and intermodulation are performed with the
interferer(s) applied to each *antenna connector* mapped to the receiver
for the wanted signal(s), however only to one *antenna connector* at a
time. *Antenna connectors* to which no signals are applied are
terminated.

#### 4.5.1.3 Duplexers

The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer
fitted, if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is
supplied as an option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be
repeated with and without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.

The following tests shall be performed with the duplexer fitted, and
without it fitted if this is an option:

1\) clause 6.2, base station output power, for the highest static power
step only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;

2\) clause 6.6, unwanted emissions; outside the BS transmit band;

3\) clause 6.6.5.5.1.2, protection of the BS receiver;

4\) clause 6.7, transmit intermodulation; for the testing of
conformance, the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize
intermodulation products from the transmitters falling in receive
channels.

The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer
fitted.

NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is
important to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not
affect the test apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of
attenuators, isolators and filters.

NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be
generated, not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The
intermodulation products generated in the antenna system are not
controlled by 3GPP specifications, and may degrade during operation
(e.g. due to moisture ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued
satisfactory operation of a BS, an operator will normally select
NR-ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive
channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator may specify
the NR-ARFCNs to be used.

#### 4.5.1.4 Power supply options

If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be
supplied either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In
this case, the conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power
supply options can be tested by testing only the external DC supply
option. The range of DC input voltages for the test should be sufficient
to verify the performance with any of the power supplies, over its range
of operating conditions within the BS, including variation of mains
input voltage, temperature and output current.

#### 4.5.1.5 Ancillary RF amplifiers

The *BS type 1-C* requirements of the present document shall be met with
the ancillary RF amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7
for TX and RX respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the
BS by a connecting network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.)
with applicable loss to make sure the appropriate operating conditions
of the ancillary amplifier and the BS. The applicable connecting network
loss range is declared by the manufacturer (D.35). Other characteristics
and the temperature dependence of the attenuation of the connecting
network are neglected. The actual attenuation value of the connecting
network is chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme values.
The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.

Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted
and, if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify
that the BS meets the requirements of the present document in both
cases.

When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where \"x\"
denotes that the test is applicable:

Table 4.5.1.5-1: Tests applicable to ancillary RF amplifiers

NOTE 1: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The
amplifiers can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of
these amplifiers could be a passive network.

NOTE 2: Unless otherwise stated, BS with both TX and RX amplifiers are
tested once with both amplifiers active for each test.

In base station output power test (clause 6.2) and reference sensitivity
level test (clause 7.2) highest applicable attenuation value is applied.

### 4.5.2 *BS type 1-H*

#### 4.5.2.1 Transmit configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics in
clause 6 are specified at the *transceiver array boundary* at the *TAB
connector(s)* with a full complement of transceiver units for the
configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.5.2.1-1: Transmitter test ports

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each transmit *TAB connector.*

#### 4.5.2.2 Receive configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted receiver characteristics in
clause 7 are specified at the *TAB connector* with a full complement of
transceiver units for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.5.2.2-1: Receiver test ports

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receive *TAB connector*.

Conducted receive requirements are tested at the *TAB connector*, with
the remaining receiver units(s) disabled or their *TAB connector*(s)
being terminated.

#### 4.5.2.3 Power supply options

If the *BS type 1-H* is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.5.3 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the
integrated Iuant BS modem shall be switched OFF. Spurious emissions
according to clauses 6.6.5 and 7.6 shall be measured only for
frequencies above 20 MHz with the integrated Iuant BS modem switched ON.

### 4.7.3 NRTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of test configuration NRTC1 is to test all BS requirements
excluding CA occupied bandwidth.

For NRTC1 used in receiver tests only the two outermost carriers within
each supported operating band need to be generated by the test
equipment;

#### 4.7.3.1 NRTC1 generation

NRTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth supported for contiguous
spectrum operation (D.11) shall be used;

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. Place same signal
adjacent to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- If NB-IoT operation in NR in-band is supported, place the power
boosted NB-IoT RB at the lower outermost RB at the lower Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge eligible for NB-IoT operation in NR in-band according to
clause 5.7.3 of TS 36.104 \[22\] and the definition in clause 3.1. If
more than one NB-IoT carrier is supported with NB-IoT operation in NR
in-band, place the power boosted NB-IoT RB at the upper outermost RB at
the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge eligible for NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band.

\- For transmitter tests, select as many carriers (according to 4.7.2)
that the BS supports within an *operating band* and fit in the rest of
the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth (D.11). Place the
carriers adjacent to each other starting from the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge. The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 5.4.1 shall apply.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis for all component carriers of the inter-band CA bands declared to
be supported by the BS and are transmitted using the same *antenna
connector*. All configured component carriers are transmitted
simultaneously in the tests where the transmitter should be ON.

#### 4.7.3.2 NRTC1 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,AC~, or P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.4 NRTC2: Contiguous CA occupied bandwidth

NRTC2 in this clause is used to test CA occupied bandwidth.

#### 4.7.4.1 NRTC2 generation

The CA specific test configuration should be constructed on a per band
basis using the following method:

\- Of all component carrier combinations supported by the BS, those
which have smallest and largest sum of channel bandwidth of **component
carriers**, shall be tested. Of all component carrier combinations which
have smallest or largest sum of channel bandwidth of component carriers
supported by the BS, only one combination having largest sum and one
combination having smallest sum shall be tested irrespective of the
number of component carriers.

\- Of all **component carrier** combinations which have same sum of
channel bandwidth of **component carrier**, select those with the
narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing at the
lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- Of the combinations selected in the previous step, select one with
the narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing at
the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the smallest number of **component carrier**.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the lowest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the highest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the carrier which has been selected in the
previous step.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, repeat
the previous step until there is only one combination left.

\- The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

#### 4.7.4.2 NRTC2 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to be the same level so
that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,AC~, or P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) for NR according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.5 NRTC3: Non-contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of NRTC3 is to test all BS requirements excluding CA
occupied bandwidth.

For NRTC3 used in receiver tests, outermost carriers for each sub-block
need to be generated by the test equipment; other supported carriers are
optional to be generated.

#### 4.7.5.1 NRTC3 generation

NRTC3 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth supported for non-contiguous spectrum operation (D.11). The
Base Station RF Bandwidth consists of one sub-block gap and two
sub-blocks located at the edges of the declared maximum supported Base
Station RF Bandwidth (D.11).

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2. Place it adjacent
to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge and another carrier (as
described in 4.7.2) adjacent to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge.

\- If NB-IoT operation in NR in-band is supported, place the power
boosted NB-IoT RB at the lower outermost RB at the lower Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge eligible for NB-IoT operation in NR in-band according to
clause 5.7.3 of TS 36.104 \[22\] and the definition in clause 3.1. If
more than one NB-IoT carrier is supported with NB-IoT operation in NR
in-band, place the power boosted NB-IoT RB at the upper outermost RB at
the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge eligible for NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band.

\- For single-band operation receiver tests, if the remaining gap is at
least 15 MHz (or 60 MHz if channel bandwidth of the carrier to be tested
is 20 MHz) plus two times the channel BW used in the previous step and
the BS supports at least 4 carriers, place a carrier of this BW adjacent
to each already placed carrier for each sub-block. The nominal channel
spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.4.1 shall apply.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

#### 4.7.5.2 NRTC3 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the rated total output power (P~rated,t,AC~, or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration in
clause 4.6.

### 4.7.6 NRTC4: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

The purpose of NRTC4 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
maximum supported number of carriers.

#### 4.7.6.1 NRTC4 generation

NRTC4 is based on re-using the previously specified test configurations
applicable per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed
using the following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall
be the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth in multi-band
operation (D.12).

\- The number of carriers of each supported *operating band* shall be
the declared maximum number of supported carriers per operating band in
multi-band operation (D. 18). Carriers shall be selected according to
4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the
Base Station RF Bandwidths edges, if possible.

\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall
be located at the outermost edges of the declared maximum Radio
Bandwidth.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to NRTC1, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. The mirror
image of the single-band test configuration shall be used in each
alternate band(s) and in the highest band being.

\- If only three carriers are supported, two carriers shall be placed in
one band according to the relevant test configuration while the
remaining carrier shall be placed at the edge of the maximum *Radio
Bandwidth* in the other band.

\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidths of each
supported *operating bands* is larger than the declared *Total RF
Bandwidth* BW~tot~ (D.13) of transmitter and receiver for the declared
band combinations of the BS, repeat the steps above for test
configurations where the Base Station RF Bandwidth of one of the
operating band shall be reduced so that the *Total RF Bandwidth* of
transmitter and receiver is not exceeded and vice versa.

\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carriers per operating
band in multi-band operation (D.18) is larger than the declared total
maximum number of supported carriers in multi-band operation (D. 19),
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall
be reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not
exceeded and vice versa.

#### 4.7.6.2 NRTC4 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power (P~rated,t,AC~ or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported *operating band(s)* exceeds the
declared rated total output power of the *operating band(s)* in
multi-band operation, the exceeded part shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other band(s). If the power allocated for a carrier
exceeds the rated output power declared for that carrier, the exceeded
power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

### 4.7.7 NRTC5: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier

The purpose of NRTC5 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
higher PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and non-contiguous
operation (if supported) in multi-band mode.

#### 4.7.7.1 NRTC5 generation

NRTC5 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable
per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported *operating band*
shall be the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth in multi-band
operation (D.12).

\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall
be located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio
Bandwidth.

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall be selected according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth for outermost
bands and at the Base Station RF Bandwidths edges for middle band(s) if
any. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the Base Station RF
Bandwidths edges, if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to NRTC3, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest
supported NR channel bandwidth and smallest subcarrier spacing shall be
used in the test configuration.

\- If only one carrier can be placed for the concerned band(s), the
carrier(s) shall be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum radio bandwidth for outermost band(s) and at one of the
outermost edges of the supported frequency range within the Base Station
RF Bandwidths for middle band(s) if any.

\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared *Total RF Bandwidth* BW~tot~
(D.13) of transmitter and receiver for the declared band combinations of
the BS, repeat the steps above for test configurations where the Base
Station RF Bandwidth of one of the operating band shall be reduced so
that the *Total RF Bandwidth* BW~tot~ of transmitter and receiver is not
exceeded and vice versa.

#### 4.7.7.2 NRTC5 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the total rated output power (P~rated,t,AC~ or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported *operating band(s)* exceeds the
declared rated total output power of the *operating band(s)* in
multi-band operation, the exceeded part shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other band(s). If the power allocated for a carrier
exceeds the rated output power declared for that carrier, the exceeded
power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

### 4.7.8 NRTC6: Non-contiguous spectrum operation in band n46 and n96

The purpose of test configuration NRTC6 is to test operating band
unwanted emission (OBUE) for one or two non-transmitted 20 MHz channels
for band n46 and n96 operation with 60 MHz and or 80 MHz channel
bandwidth.

#### 4.7.8.1 NRTC6 generation

NRTC6 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth supported for contiguous
spectrum operation (D.11) shall be used.

\- For 60 MHz channel bandwidth, place 60 MHz carrier with ON-OFF-ON
pattern for non-contiguous transmission at the upper edge of the BS
channel bandwidth for the carrier adjacent to the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge and 60 MHz carrier with ON-OFF-ON pattern for
non-contiguous transmission at the lower edge of the BS channel
bandwidth for the carrier adjacent to the lower Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge.

\- For 80MHz channel bandwidth, place 80 MHz carrier with ON-OFF-OFF-ON
pattern for non-contiguous transmission at the upper edge of the BS
channel bandwidth for the carrier adjacent to the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge and 80 MHz carrier with ON-OFF-OFF-ON pattern for
non-contiguous transmission at the lower edge of the BS channel
bandwidth for the carrier adjacent to the lower Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge.

\- For transmitter tests, select as many 60 MHz channel bandwidth (with
ON-OFF-ON pattern for non-contiguous transmission) or 80 MHz channel
bandwidth (with ON-OFF-OFF-ON pattern for non-contiguous transmission)
that the BS supports within an *operating band* and fit in the rest of
the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth (D.11). Place the 60 MHz
channel bandwidth (with ON-OFF-ON pattern for non-contiguous
transmission) or 80 MHz channel bandwidth (with ON-OFF-OFF-ON pattern
for non-contiguous transmission) adjacent to each other starting from
the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The nominal channel spacing
defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.4.1 shall apply.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis for all component carriers of the inter-band CA bands declared to
be supported by the BS and are transmitted using the same *antenna
connector*. All configured component carriers are transmitted
simultaneously in the tests where the transmitter should be ON.

#### 4.7.8.2 NRTC6 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,AC~, or P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.8.3 Applicability of test configurations for single-band operation

The applicable test configurations are specified in the tables below for
each the supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according
to clause 4.6. The generation and power allocation for each test
configuration is defined in clause 4.7. This clause contains the test
configurations for a BS capable of single carrier, multi-carrier and/or
CA operation in both contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single
band.

For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only (D.16),
a single carrier (SC) shall be used for testing.

For a BS declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA operation in
contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.15-D.16), the test
configurations in the second column of table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for
testing.

For a BS declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA operation in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.15-D.16)
and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to
clause 4.6 are identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC)
spectrum operation (D.9), the test configurations in the third column of
table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for testing.

For a BS declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA in operation
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.15-D.16)
and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to
clause 4.6 are not identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC)
spectrum operation (D.9), the test configurations in the fourth column
of table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for testing.

For a BS declared to support band n46 and/or band n96 operation with 60
MHz and or 80 MHz channel bandwidth with non-contiguous transmission,
the test configuration NRTC6 shall be used for operation band unwanted
emission.

Unless otherwise stated, single carrier configuration (SC) tests shall
be performed using signal with narrowest supported channel bandwidth and
the smallest supported sub-carrier spacing.

### 4.8.4 Applicability of test configurations for *multi-band* operation

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the test
configuration in table 4.8.4-1 and/or table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for
testing. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on common
*multi-band connector*, the test configuration in the second column of
table 4.8.4-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped
on common *single-band connector*, the test configuration in table
4.8.3-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector*, the test
configuration in the third column of table 4.8.4-1 shall be used.

Unless otherwise stated, single carrier configuration (SC) tests shall
be performed using signal with narrowest supported channel bandwidth and
the smallest supported sub-carrier spacing.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single carrier testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the BS. These are denoted as RF channels B
(bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~
(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located in the middle of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

Occupied bandwidth test in this TS is performed with the *aggregated BS
channel bandwidth* and sub-block bandwidths located at the bottom,
middle and top of the supported frequency range in the operating band.
These are denoted as B~BW\ Channel\ CA~(bottom), M~BW\ Channel\ CA~
(middle) and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ (top) for contiguous spectrum operation.

Unless otherwise stated, the test for contiguous spectrum operation
shall be performed at B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and
T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ defined as following:

\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- M~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located close
in the middle of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- T~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in each operating band.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the
test shall be performed at B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~: the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and
at the highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
Maximum Radio Bandwidth, in the highest operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in the highest operating band and
at the lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
Maximum Radio Bandwidth, in the lowest operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands.
B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* are located at
the bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band
and at the top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating
band.

T for single carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation, B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~
for contiguous spectrum operation in each supported operating band, the
position of B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported
operating band combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

### 4.9.2 Test models

#### 4.9.2.1 General

The following clauses will describe the NR FR1 test models needed for
*BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*. Note that the NR FR1 test models are
also applicable to *BS type 1-O* conformance testing in TS 38.141-2
\[3\].

#### 4.9.2.2 FR1 test models

The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according
to one of the NR FR1 test models (NR-FR1‑TM) below. A reference to the
applicable test model is made within each test.

The following general parameters are used by all NR test models:

\- Duration is 1 radio frame (10 ms) for FDD and 2 radio frames for TDD
(20 ms)

\- The slots are numbered 0 to 10×2^µ^ -- 1 where µ is the numerology
corresponding to the subcarrier spacing

\- N~RB~ is the maximum transmission bandwidth configuration seen in
table 5.3.2-1 in TS 38.104 \[2\].

\- Normal CP

\- Virtual resource blocks of localized type

For FR1-TDD without NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, test models are
derived based on the uplink/downlink configuration as shown in the table
4.9.2.2-1 using information element *TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon* as defined
in TS 38.331 \[19\].

##### 4.9.2.2.9 NB-IoT operation in NR in-band test model (NR-N-TM)

The NB-IoT operation in NR in-band test shall be performed by puncturing
one NR RB at the eligible (according to clause 5.7.3 of TS 36.104 \[22\]
and the definition in clause 3.1) in-band position closest to NR minimum
guard band.

The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according
to the FR1 test model 1.1 (NR-FR1-TM1.1) on all NR carriers and the
NB-IoT Test Model (N-TM) defined in TS 36.141 \[24\] on all NB-IoT
carriers.

The power for NR RE and NB-IoT RE is set by following procedures:

\- The average power per RE over all RBs (both NR and NB-IoT) is
calculated according to manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier output
power (P~rated,c,AC~, D.21);

$$\ \text{Average\ power\ per\ RE\ }(P_{\text{avg}})\  = \ \frac{P_{rated,c,AC}}{N_{\text{RB}} \times N_{\text{SC}}^{\text{RB}}}\left\lbrack W \right\rbrack$$

\- The power of boosted NB-IoT RE (P~NB-IoT~) is calculated according to
manufacturer\'s declared rated NB-IoT maximum power dynamic range (X dB
\>= 6 dB or 3 dB), with the power boosting only applies on the
N~NB\_IoT~ REs containing NB-IoT signal.

$$\ \text{Power\ of\ boosted\ NB-IoT\ RE\ }(P_{\text{NB-IoT}})\  = \text{\ }\text{P}_{\text{avg}}\text{*1}\text{0}^{(\text{X/10})}\ \left\lbrack W \right\rbrack$$

\- The remaining power is allocated to N~NR~ NR REs.

$$\ \text{Power\ of\ per\ NR\ RE\ } = \frac{\left( P_{rated,c,AC}{- P}_{\text{NB} - \text{IoT}} \times N_{NB - IoT} \right)}{N_{\text{NR}}}\ \left\lbrack W \right\rbrack$$

#### 4.9.2.3 Data content of Physical channels and Signals for NR-FR1-TM

Randomisation of the data content is obtained by utilizing a PN sequence
generator and the length-31 Gold sequence scrambling of
TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 5.2.1 which is invoked by all physical channels
prior to modulation and mapping to the RE grid.

Initialization of the scrambler and RE-mappers as defined in
TS 38.211 \[17\] use the following additional parameters:

\- $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 1$ for the lowest configured carrier,
$N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 2\ $for the 2^nd^ lowest configured
carrier,..., $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = n$ for the n^th^ configured
carrier

\- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PDCCH

\- *q* = 0 (single code word)

For NR-FR1-TM1.1 when used for TAE requirement of two layers MIMO
transmission

\- Rank 2, two layers, no precoding

\- Antenna ports starting with 1000 and 1001 for PDSCH

Otherwise

\- Rank 1, single layer

\- Antenna port starting with 1000 for PDSCH

\- Rank 1, single layer (except for TAE requirement of 2 layer MIMO
transmission)

##### 4.9.2.3.1 PDCCH

\- $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{CORESET}} = \ 2$

\- PDCCH modulation to be QPSK as described in TS 38.211 \[17\],
clause 5.1.3

\- For each slot the required amount of bits for all PDCCHs is as
follows: 1(\# of PDCCH) \* 1(\# of CCE per PDCCH) \* 6(REG per CCE) \*
9(data RE per REG) \* 2(bits per RE) with these parameters according to
the NR-FR1-TM definitions in clause 4.9.2.2

\- Generate this amount of bits from the output of the PN23 sequence
generator \[23\]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with a
starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each frame.
The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries.

\- 1 CCE shall be according to TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.3.2 using
non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping. PDCCH occupies the first 2 symbols
for 6 resource-element groups, where a resource element group equals one
resource block during one OFDM symbol.

\- Perform PDCCH scrambling according to TS 38.211 \[17\],
clause 7.3.2.3

\- $N_{\text{ID}} = N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ in DM-RS sequence
generation in TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.4.1.3

\- $n_{\text{RNTI}} = 0$ in scrambling sequence generation in
TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.3.2.3

\- Perform mapping to REs according to TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.3.2.5.

##### 4.9.2.3.2 PDSCH

\- Generate the required amount of bits from the output of the PN23
sequence generator \[23\]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with
a starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each
frame. The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries. For TDD
TMs, the PN sequence can be generated for all symbols (in the DL, UL or
special slots) or only DL symbols (in the DL or special slots). For TMs
with multi-users, the PN sequence can be generated per user (*n*~RNTI~
).

\- NR-FR1-TMs utilize 1, 2 or 3 user PDSCH transmissions distinguished
by $n_{\text{RNTI}}$. For each NR-FR1-TM, PRBs are mapped to user
($n_{\text{RNTI}}$) as follows:

#### 4.9.2.4 Data content of Physical channels and Signals for NR-N-TM

Detailed configuration for the transmitter characteristic tests are
defined in TS 36.141 \[24\],

### 4.9.3 NB-IoT testing

Unless otherwise stated, the NB-IoT operation in NR in-band test shall
be performed by puncturing one NR RB at the eligible (according to
clause 5.7.3 of TS 36.104 \[22\] and the definition in clause 3.1)
in-band position closest to NR minimum guard band; those are denoted
L~NB-IoT~ (Left) and R~NB-IoT~ (Right).

Unless otherwise stated, the NB-IoT operation in NR in-band receiver
tests shall be performed by using the tone located on the NB-IoT RB\'s
edge, which is closest to NR minimum guard band; those are denoted
B~NB-IoT~ for L~NB-IoT~ and T~NB-IoT~ for R~NB-IoT.~

Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band is only required to pass the transmitter tests for NR with
NB-IoT operation in NR in-band; it is not required to perform the
transmitter tests again for NR only.

Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band is only required to pass the receiver tests for NR with
NB-IoT operation in NR in-band; it is not required to perform the
receiver tests again for NR only.

NOTE: The BS should be configured (RRC signalling) for the NB-IoT E-UTRA
*guardband* mode during the tests.

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum
operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply
both at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the sub-block
gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges
respectively.

4.11 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
--------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band connector* the conducted test requirements in clause 6
and 7 apply separately to each supported *operating band* unless
otherwise stated. For some conducted test requirements, it is explicitly
stated that specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at
*multi-band connector(s)* as detailed in the requirement clause. For BS
capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations
(multi-band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more
*antenna* *connectors* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connectors* for *BS
type 1-H* in different ways are possible. For *multi-band connector(s)*
the exclusions or provisions for multi-band apply. For *single-band
connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this connector that is mapped to
single-band. In case there are carrier(s) transmitted simultaneously in
another supported *operating band* in common active RF components, when
the RF signals of these antenna connectors cover the same geographical
area, the frequency range of the Base Station RF bandwidth in the other
supported band to this antenna connector should be excluded from the
unwanted emission requirements.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, *single-band
requirements* shall apply to this connector configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are
applicable. *Single-band requirements* are tested separately at the
connector configured for single-band operation, with all other
connectors terminated.

A *BS type 1-H* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations of *TAB
connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All *TAB connectors* are *single-band connectors*.

\- Different sets of *single-band connectors* support different
*operating bands*, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in
one single *operating band*.

\- Sets of *single-band connectors* support operation in multiple
*operating bands* with some *single-band connectors* supporting more
than one *operating band*.

\- All *TAB connectors* are *multi-band* *connectors*.

\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of *TAB
connectors* provides support of the type *BS type 1-H* capability of
operation in multiple *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated all conducted test requirements specified for an
*operating band* apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting
that *operating band*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *single-band
connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group*, *single-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB
connectors*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *multi-band
connector*s supporting the same *operating band* combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

For *multi-band connectors* supporting the bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur between the bands.

NOTE 1: The case of an *operating band* being supported by both
*multi-band connectors* and *single-band connectors* in a *TAB connector
TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* is not covered
by the present release of this specification.

NOTE 2: The case of an *operating band* being supported by *multi-band
connectors* which are not all supporting the same *operating band*
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

NOTE 3: The conducted test requirements for *multi-band connectors*
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present
release of this specification.

4.12 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the NR and NB-IoT operation in NR in-band operating bands
specification, their channel bandwidth configurations, channel spacing
and raster, as well as synchronization raster specification, refer to
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5 and its relevant clauses.

For the conducted testing purposes in this specification, only FR1
operating bands are considered.

6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
=======================================

6.1 General
-----------

### 6.1.1 BS type 1-C

General test conditions for conducted transmitter tests are given in
clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results and
configurations for testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined
in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors* have
been declared equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary
to be tested to demonstrate conformance.

### 6.1.2 BS type 1-H

General test conditions for conducted transmitter tests are given in
clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results and
configurations for testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined
in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors* have
been declared equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary
to be tested to demonstrate conformance.

In clause 6.6.3.5.4, if representative *TAB connectors* are used then
per connector criteria (i.e. option 2) shall be applied.

*The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of
supported geographical cells (N~cells~, D.24) relates to the BS setting
with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with transmission on
all TAB connectors supporting the operating band. The manufacturer shall
also declare TAB connector TX min cell groups (D.34).* Every *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in an *operating band* shall map to
one *TAB connector TX min cell group* supporting the same *operating
band. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells is implementation
dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for BS type 1-H is
calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,\ counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~, 8·N~cells~)*

*Further:*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~/N~cells~*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the *basic limits* as
described in clause 6.6.

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

*For BS type 1-H* there is no requirement specified for band n46.

described in clause 6.5.4 provides sufficient test coverage for this
requirement.

### 6.3.3 Total power dynamic range

#### 6.3.3.1 Definition and applicability

The BS total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum
and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

NOTE 1: The upper limit of the total power dynamic range is the OFDM
symbol TX power (OSTP) for a BS at maximum output power when
transmitting on all RBs. The lower limit of the total power dynamic
range is the average power for single RB transmission. The OFDM symbols
shall carry PDSCH and not contain PDCCH, RS, or SSB.

NOTE 2: The requirement does not apply to operation with shared spectrum
channel access.

dynamic range are defined in clause 6.5.4.

### 6.3.4 NB-IoT RB power dynamic range

#### 6.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The NB-IoT RB power dynamic range (or NB-IoT power boosting) is the
difference between the average power of NB-IoT REs (which occupy certain
REs within a NR transmission bandwidth configuration plus 15 kHz at each
edge but not within the NR minimum guard band GB~Channel~) and the
average power over all REs (from both NB-IoT and the NR carrier
containing the NB-IoT REs).

#### 6.3.4.2 Minimum requirement

6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
-------------------------

### 6.4.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the BS.

Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the transmission
bandwidth configuration of the BS (BW~Config~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF period*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

For *multi-band connectors* and for *single band connectors* supporting
transmission in multiple operating bands, the requirement is only
applicable during the *transmitter OFF period* in all supported
operating bands.

For BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power is
defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth*
**BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2 during the
*transmitter OFF period*.** N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the *aggregated BS channel
bandwidth*.

#### 6.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.4.1.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.4.1.3.

#### 6.4.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter OFF power is

described in clause 6.4.2.4.

#### 6.4.1.5 Test requirements

The conformance testing of transmit OFF power is included in the
conformance testing of transmitter transient period; therefore, see
clause 6.4.2.5 for test requirements.

### 6.4.2 Transmitter transient period

#### 6.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

*Transmitter transient period* requirements apply only to TDD operation
of the BS.

The *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which the
transmitter unit is changing from the OFF period to the ON period or
vice versa. The *transmitter transient period* is illustrated in figure
6.4.2.1-1.

Figure 6.4.2.1-1: Illustration of the relations of transmitter ON
period, transmitter OFF period and transmitter transient period

This requirement applies at each *antenna connector* or *TAB connector*
supporting transmission in the operating band.

#### 6.4.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 6.4.2.2.

#### 6.4.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter transient periods
are within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.4.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.4.2.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *antenna connectors* or *TAB
connectors*, they may be tested one at a time or multiple *antenna
connectors* or *TAB connectors* may be tested in parallel as shown in
annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C* or in annex D.3.1 for *BS type 1-H*.
Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until all *antenna
connectors* or *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate conformance
have been tested.

1\) Connect *antenna connector* or *TAB connector* to measurement
equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C* or in annex D.3.1
for *BS type 1-H*. All *antenna connectors* or *TAB connectors* not
under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

2\) For single carrier set the *antenna connector* or *TAB connector*
under test to transmit according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical
channels in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output
power* per *antenna connector* or *TAB connector* (P~rated,c,AC~, or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the *antenna
connector* or *TAB connector* centred on the central frequency of the RF
bandwidth. 70/N μs average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end
of one transmitter ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next
transmitter ON period -- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier
Spacing in kHz.

4\) For an *antenna connector* or *TAB connector* supporting contiguous
CA, measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the *aggregated BS channel
bandwidth* BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2.
70/N μs average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end of one
transmitter ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next
transmitter ON period -- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the *aggregated BS channel
bandwidth*.

In addition, for *multi-band connector(s)*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.4.2.5 Test requirements

The measured mean power spectral density according to clause 6.4.2.4.2
shall be less than -83 dBm/MHz for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz.

The measured mean power spectral density according to clause 6.4.2.4.2
shall be less than -82.5 dBm/MHz for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \< f ≤
6.0 GHz in licensed spectrum only.

The measured mean power spectral density according to clause 6.4.2.4.2
shall be less than -82 dBm/MHz for bands n46 and n96.

For *multi-band connector*, the requirement is only applicable during
the transmitter OFF period in all supported operating bands.

6.5 Transmitted signal quality
------------------------------

### 6.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6.5 apply during the
*transmitter ON period*.

### 6.5.2 Frequency error

#### 6.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

It is not possible to verify by testing that the data clock is derived
from the same frequency source as used for RF generation. This may be
confirmed by the manufacturer\'s declaration.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 6.5.1.2.

#### 6.5.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that frequency error is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.2.4 Method of test

Requirement is tested together with modulation quality test, as
described in clause 6.5.3.

#### 6.5.2.5 Test Requirements

The modulated carrier frequency of each NR carrier configured by the BS
shall be accurate to within the accuracy range given in table 6.5.2.5-1
observed over 1 ms.

Table 6.5.2.5-1: Frequency error test requirement

  ----------------- ---------------------
  BS class          Accuracy
  Wide Area BS      ±(0.05 ppm + 12 Hz)
  Medium Range BS   ±(0.1 ppm + 12 Hz)
  Local Area BS     ±(0.1 ppm + 12 Hz)
  ----------------- ---------------------

The frequency error requirement for NB-IoT is specified in
TS 36.141 \[24\] clause 6.5.1.5.

### 6.5.3 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 6.5.2.2.

#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that modulation quality is within the
limit specified by the minimum requirement.

Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until all *antenna
connectors* or *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate conformance
have been tested.

1\) For an *antenna connector* or *TAB connector* declared to be capable
of single carrier operation only (D.16), set the *antenna connector* or
the *TAB connector* under test to transmit a signal according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
models:

\- NR-FR1-TM 3.1a if 256QAM is supported by BS without power back off,
or

all carriers configured:

\- NR-FR1-TM 3.1a if 256QAM is supported by BS without power back off,
or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.1a at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if
256QAM is supported by BS with power back off, and NR-FR1-TM3.1 at
maximum power, or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.1 if highest modulation order supported by BS is 64QAM, or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by BS is 16QAM, or

The modulation quality requirements for NB-IoT are specified in
TS 36.141 \[24\] clause 6.5.2.5.

### 6.5.4 Time alignment error

#### 6.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

This requirement applies to frame timing in MIMO transmission, carrier
aggregation and their combinations.

Frames of the NR signals present at the BS transmitter *antenna
connectors* or *TAB connectors* are not perfectly aligned in time and
may experience certain timing differences in relation to each other.

For *BS type 1-C*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to different *antenna connectors* for
a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-H*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to *TAB connectors* belonging to
different transmitter groups at the *transceiver array boundary*, where
transmitter groups are associated with the *TAB connectors* in the
transceiver unit array corresponding to MIMO transmission, *carrier
aggregation* for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 6.5.3.2.

#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

To verify that the time alignment error is within the limit specified by
the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-C* *antenna connectors* to be tested are for a specific
set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-H* *TAB connectors* to be tested are identified from the
declared sets of *TAB connector beam forming groups* in the TAE groups
declaration (D.31).

Compliance is to be demonstrated between all pairs of *single-band
connectors and/or multi-band connectors*, however it is not required to
exhaustively measure TAE between every combination of pairs of
representative connectors. Compliance can be demonstrated by comparison
of a reduced set of representative measurement results.

1\) Conducted measurement setup:

> \- For *BS type 1-C*: Connect two *antenna connectors* to the
> measurement equipment according to annex D.1.3. Terminate any unused
> *antenna connector(s)*.
>
> \- For *BS type 1-H*: Connect two representative *TAB connectors* one
> from separate TAE group (D.31) to the measurement equipment according
> to annex D.3.4. Terminate any unused *TAB connector(s).*

2\) Set the connectors under test to transmit NR-FR1-TM 1.1 or any DL
signal using MIMO transmission or carrier aggregation.

NOTE: For MIMO transmission, different ports may be configured in
NR-FR1-TM 1.1 (using *PDSCH DMRS ports 1000 and 1001*).

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models in clause 4.9.2 at *rated carrier output
power* (P~rated,c,AC~, or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

If the connector under test supports intra band contiguous or
non-contiguous CA, set the representative connectors to transmit using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

If the BS supports inter band CA, set the representative connectors to
transmit, for each band, a single carrier or all carriers, using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

For a connector declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation
(D.15), set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test signal
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7
and 4.8 using the corresponding test model in clause 4.9.2 on all
carriers configured.

4\) Measure the time alignment error between the different PDSCH
demodulation reference signals on different antenna ports belonging to
different connectorson the carrier(s) from the representative connectors
under test.

5\) Repeat step 1 - 4 for any other configuration of connectors, which
could be required to demonstrate compliance.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.5.4.5 Test requirement

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, TAE shall not exceed
90 ns.

For intra-band contiguous CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not exceed
285 ns.

For intra-band non-contiguous CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not
exceed 3.025 µs.

For inter-band CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not exceed 3.025 µs.

The time alignment error requirements for NB-IoT are specified in
TS 36.141 \[24\] clause 6.5.3.5.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions in recommendation ITU-R SM.329
\[5\]. In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation
process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious
emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the operating band edge is Δf~OBUE~. The operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~
below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

Table 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  BS type         Operating band characteristics                   Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------ ----------------
  *BS type 1-C*   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 200 MHz              10
                  200 MHz \< F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_~low ≤ 900 MHz   40
  *BS type 1-H*   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ \< 100 MHz             10
                  100 MHz ≤ F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_~low ≤ 900 MHz    40

For band n46 and n96, the values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table
6.6.1-1a.

Table 6.6.1-1a: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  ***Operating band***   **Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)**
  ---------------------- --------------------
  n46                    40
  n96                    50

For *BS type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied per the
*TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the configurations supported
by the BS. The *basic limits* and corresponding emissions scaling are
defined in each relevant clause.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth 

#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[12\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be appliedat each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is in
TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 6.6.2

#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *antenna
connector or* *TAB connector* does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for
the service to be provided and is, therefore, not likely to create
interference to other users of the spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Aggregated BS channel bandwidth* positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~; see clause 4.9.1.

1\) Connect the measurement device to the BS *antenna connector* or *TAB
connector* as shown in annex D1.1 for *BS type 1-C* or D3.1 for *BS type
1-H*.

2\) For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation (D.16),
start transmission according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model NR-FR1-TM1.1 at
manufacturer\'s declared rated output power (P~rated,c,AC~, or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous CA operation, set the BS
to transmit according to NR-FR1-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.4 and 4.8.

For a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band
(D.41), test shall be performed using N-TM according to
clause 4.9.2.2.9.

##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in
table 6.6.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the
analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.

measurements

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode must be power responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the
average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the
measurement cell.

2\) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the power outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total power outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005
times P0.

3\) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds
P1.

4\) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.

5\) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall
apply:

6\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single carrier test models shall apply,
with no carrier activated in the other band. In addition, when
contiguous CA is supported, single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirements

The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], table 5.3.5-1 for *BS type 1-C*
and *BS type 1-H*. For contiguous CA, t**he occupied bandwidth shall be
less than or equal to the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* as defined
in** TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.3A.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.6.3.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered (single
carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer\'s specification.

The requirements shall also apply if the BS supports NB-IoT operation in
NR in-band.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the ACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub block gaps*, while the CACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub block gaps*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2
shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps*, while the CACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps*.

The requirement applies during the *transmitter ON period*.

#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.3.3.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.3.4.

#### 6.6.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement
shall be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.6.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.3.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C* or in annex D.3.1 for
*BS type 1-H*. Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until
all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate conformance have been
tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C*
and in annex D.3.1 for *BS type 1-H*. All connectors not under test
shall be terminated.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

> \- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.6.3.5.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1. 2) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to
transmit according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8
using the corresponding test models NR-FR1‑TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at
*rated carrier output power* P~rated,c,AC~ for *BS type 1-C* and
P~rated,c,TABC~ for *BS type 1-H* (D.21).

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

> For a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band
> (D.41), test shall be performed using N-TM according to
> clause 4.9.2.2.9.

3\) Measure ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel
frequency as specified in table 6.6.3.5.2‑1. In multiple carrier case
only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.

4\) For the ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for
non-contiguous spectrum operation, or inside *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*
for multi-band operation:

a\) Measure ACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* as
specified in clause 6.6.3.5.2, if applicable.

b\) Measure CACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* as
specified in clause 6.6.3.5.2, if applicable.

5\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to NR-FR1-TM 1.2
in clause 4.9.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.6.3.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.3.5.1 General requirements

The ACLR requirements in clause 6.6.3.5.2 shall apply as described in
clauses 6.6.3.5.3 or 6.6.3.5.4.

##### 6.6.3.5.2 Limits and *basic limits*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum except for band n46 and
n96, the ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.6.3.5.2‑1.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.6.3.5.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.6.3.5.2-6.

For operation in non-contiguous spectrum or multiple bands except for
band n46 and n96, the CACLR for NR carriers located on either side of
the sub-block gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap shall be higher than the
value specified in table 6.6.3.5.2-4.

### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of
each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑1 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. In addition, for a BS operating in non-contiguous
spectrum, the requirements apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition,
for a BS operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

B*asic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is
specified in the clauses 6.6.4.5.2 to 6.6.4.5.5below, where in this
case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
*basic limits* apply also in a supported operating band without any
carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted
in another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative *basic
limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink
operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink
operating band without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~, f\_offset~max~
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and the operating
band unwanted emission *basic limit* of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause,
shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits*
of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the
tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~),
shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band connector* or a *single-band connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier
aggregation the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier
transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the
carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified
frequency band.

In addition inside any sub-block gap for a *single-band connector*
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, a combined *basic limit* shall be
applied which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified for
the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The *basic
limit* for each sub block is specified in the subcluases 6.6.4.5.2 to
6.6.4.5.5below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Wide Area BS, the requirements of either clause 6.6.4.5.2 (Category
A limits) or clause 6.6.4.5.3 (Category B limits) shall apply.

For Medium Range BS, the requirements in clause 6.6.4.5.4 shall apply
(Category A and B).

For Local Area BS, the requirements of clause 6.6.4.5.5 shall apply
(Category A and B).

The requirements shall also apply if the BS supports NB-IoT operation in
NR in-band.

The application of either Category A or Category B *basic limits* shall
be the same as for transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.6.5.

#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.4.3.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.4.4.

#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.3.1. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C*
or in annex D.3.1 for *BS type 1-H*. All connectors not under test shall
be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

2\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the representative connectors under test to transmit according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated carrier
output power* P~rated,c,AC~ for *BS type 1-C* and P~rated,c,TABC~ for
*BS type 1-H* (D.21). Channel set-up shall be according to NR-FR1-TM
1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation set the connector under test to transmit on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

> For a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band
> (D.41), test shall be performed using N-TM according to
> clause 4.9.2.2.9.

3\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For connector under test
declared to operate in multiple bands or non-contiguous spectrum, the
emission within the *Inter RF Bandwidth* or *sub-block gap* shall be
measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF
Bandwidth or sub block edge.

4\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases, with the channel
set-up according to NR-FR1-TM 1.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

> 5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
> steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
> configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated
> in the other *operating band*.

##### 6.6.4.5.5A Basic limits for Local Area and Medium Range BS for band n46 and n96 (Category A and B)

For Local Area and Medium Range BS operating in Band n46, basic limits
for 10 MHz channel bandwidth are specified in table 6.6.4.5.5A-1. For
Local Area and Medium Range BS operating in Band n46 and Band n96, basic
limits for 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 60 MHz and 80 MHz channel bandwidth are
specified in table 6.6.4.5.5A-2. The nominal bandwidth N = BW~Channel~
of the transmitted carrier. For one non-transmitted channel basic limits
are specified in table 6.6.4.5.5A-3, and for two non-transmitted
channels basic limits are specified in table 6.6.4.5.5A-4.

In the case of one or two non-transmitted 20 MHz channels between
transmitted channels, when a NR-U channel bandwidth of 60 MHz or 80 MHz
have been assigned, the spectrum emission mask for non-transmitted
channels specified in Table 6.6.4.5.5A-3 and Table 6.6.4.5.5A-4 applies
for one and two non-transmitted channels respectively. The spectrum
emission mask for non-transmitted channels apply to frequencies
(Δf~BE\_offset~) starting from the edge of the last transmitted channel
of the channels assigned for NR-U channel bandwidth. The relative power
of any BS emission shall not exceed the most stringent levels given by
Table 6.6.4.5.5A-2 and Table 6.6.4.5.5A-3 in the case of non-transmitted
channels between transmitted channels.

spectrum emission mask is applied to the total bandwidth of the
remaining transmitted channels.

The relative power of any BS emission shall not exceed the most
stringent levels given by the initial general spectrum emission mask
with full channel bandwidth and the additional spectrum emission mask
with the channel bandwidth of the transmitted channels in the case of
non-transmitted channels at the edge of an assigned NR-U channel

##### 6.6.4.5.6 Basic limits for additional requirements

###### 6.6.4.5.6.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.4.5.2 to 6.6.4.5.5, the
BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by
FCC Title 47 \[13\], when deployed in regions where those limits are
applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.

###### 6.6.4.5.6.2 Protection of DTT

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *BS type 1-C* or *BS type 1-H* operating in Band n20, the level
of emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter
bandwidth on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table
6.6.4.5.6.2-1, *basic limit* is P~EM,N~ declared by the manufacturer.
This requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though
part of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Table 6.6.4.5.6.2-1: Declared emissions *basic limit* for protection of
DTT

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  21 ≤ N ≤ 60                                                  

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain
and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the BS needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined
using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[22\], annex G.

###### 6.6.4.5.6.3 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for Band n48

The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n48 in
certain regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified
in Table 6.6.4.5.6.3-1.

Table 6.6.4.5.6.3-1: Additional operating band unwanted emission limits
for Band n48

  Channel bandwidth   Frequency offset of measurement filter ‑3dB point, ∆f   Frequency offset of measurement filter centre frequency, f\_offset   Minimum requirement   Measurement bandwidth (Note)
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------
  All                 0 MHz ≤ ∆f \< 10 MHz                                    0.5 MHz ≤ f\_offset \< 9.5 MHz                                       -13 dBm               1 MHz

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

###### 6.6.4.5.6.4 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for Band n53

The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n53 in
certain regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified
in table 6.6.4.5.6.4-1.

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the *measurement bandwidth*. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the *measurement bandwidth*. When the resolution bandwidth
is smaller than the *measurement bandwidth*, the result should be
integrated over the *measurement bandwidth* in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the *measurement bandwidth*.

##### 6.6.4.5.6.5 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for operation with shared spectrum channel access {#additional-operating-band-unwanted-emissions-limits-for-operation-with-shared-spectrum-channel-access .H6}

In addition, for operation with shared spectrum channel access, the BS
may have to comply with the applicable operating band unwanted emission
limits established regionally, when deployed in regions where those
limits apply and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer. The
regional requirements may be in the form of conducted power, power
spectral density, EIRP and other types of limits. In case of regulatory
limits based on EIRP, assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex
F.2.

##### 6.6.4.5.7 *BS type 1-C*

The operating band unwanted emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each
*antenna connector* shall be below the applicable *basic limits* defined
in clauses 6.6.4.5.2 -- 6.6.4.5.6.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted
emissions limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over
all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C.*

##### 6.6.4.5.8 *BS type 1-H*

The operating band unwanted emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are
that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable
*basic limit* in clauses 6.6.4.5.2 -- 6.6.4.5.6, the power summation
emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell
group* shall not exceed a BS limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*,
where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1. For some *operating
bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with
the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating band*, as specified
in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[5\].

For a *multi-band connector*, each supported *operating band* together
with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter spurious
emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

The requirements shall apply to BS that support NR or NR with NB-IoT
operation in NR in-band.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

For operation in region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in
FCC Title 47 \[13\] is applicable, N~TXU,countedpercell~ shall be equal
to one for the purposes of calculating the spurious emissions limits in
clauses 6.6.5. For all other unwanted emissions requirements,
N~TXU,countedpercell~ shall be the value calculated according to
clause 6.1.

#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.5.3.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.5.4.

#### 6.6.5.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.6.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~;
see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below F~DL\_low~ -
Δf~OBUE~; T~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies above
F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below
F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ of the lowest operating band; B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
when testing the spurious frequencies above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ of
the highest operating band in multi-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.5.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.3.1. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C*
and in annex D.3.1 for *BS type 1-H*. All connectors not under test
shall be terminated.

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.6.5.5.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~, or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21). Channel
set-up shall be according to NR-FR1-TM 1.1.

> For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
> and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to
> transmit on all carriers configured using the applicable test
> configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7
> and 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical
> channels in clause 4.9.2.
>
> For a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band
> (D.41), test shall be performed using N-TM according to
> clause 4.9.2.2.9.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.6.5.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.5.5.1 Basic limits

###### 6.6.5.5.1.1 Tx spurious emissions

The limits of either table 6.6.5.5.1.1-1 (Category A limits) or table
6.6.5.5.1.1-2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of either
Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for operating band
unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.4, and as declared by the manufacturer
(D.4).

###### 6.6.5.5.1.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of the BSs being desensitised by emissions from a
BS transmitter. It is measured at the transmit *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* or at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H* for any type
of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx *antenna* *connectors* / *TAB
connectors*.

The *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.5.1.2-1.

Table 6.6.5.5.1.2-1: BS spurious emissions *basic limits* for protection
of the BS receiver

  BS class          Frequency range             Basic limit   Measurement bandwidth
  ----------------- --------------------------- ------------- -----------------------
  Wide Area BS                                  -96 dBm       
  Medium Range BS   F~UL\_low~ -- F~UL\_high~   -91 dBm       100 kHz
  Local Area BS                                 -88 dBm       

###### 6.6.5.5.1.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink *operating band*. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.4.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the *basic limits*
of table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with
the system listed in the first column apply. For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.5.5.1.3-1 apply for each supported *operating band*.

co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in
table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range
immediately outside the downlink *operating band* (see TS 38.104 \[2\],
table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be
covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where
the frequency ranges in TS 38.104 \[2\], table 5.2-1 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a
case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent *operating bands* can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may
apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For Band n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band
27 UL *operating band*.

NOTE 5: For NR Band n29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for NR BS for co-existence with UTRA Band
XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL
operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.6.1.

The *basic limits* for this requirement is:

Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-2: BS spurious emissions *basic limits* for BS for
co-existence with PHS

Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-3: Void

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating
in Band n50 and n75 within 1432-1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and Band n76.
The *basic limits* are specified in table 6.6.5.5.1.3-4. This
requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the BS downlink *operating
band*.

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating
in NR Band n50 within 1492-1517 MHz. The maximum level of emissions,
measured on centre frequencies F~filter~ with filter bandwidth according
to table 6.6.5.5.1.3-5, shall be defined according to the *basic limits*
P~EM,n50,a~ and P~EM,B50,b~ declared by the manufacturer.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in ECC/DEC/(17)06 \[14\], is
defined in terms of EIRP, which is dependent on both the BS emissions at
the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in
TS 38.104 \[2\] annex E.

In certain regions, the following requirement shall be applied to BS
operating in Band n14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection
is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is
also applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest
frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the
highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

The following requirement may apply to NR BS operating in Band n30 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency
range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink
operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band.

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

The following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band n26
to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800

###### 6.6.5.5.1.4 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class.

The *basic limits* are in table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 for a BS where
requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column
apply, depending on the declared BS class (D.2). For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.5.5.1.4-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the BS transmit
frequency range of a downlink *operating band* (see TS 38.104 \[2\]
table 5.2-1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are
certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques
are addressed in TR 25.942 \[15\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where
the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in
TS 38.104 \[2\] table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in
the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent *operating band* can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

##### 6.6.5.5.2 (void)

##### 6.6.5.5.3 *BS type 1-C*

The Tx spurious emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each *antenna connector*
shall not exceed the *basic limits* specified in clause 6.6.5.5.1.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C* shall not
exceed the *basic limits* defined in clause 6.6.5.5.1.

##### 6.6.5.5.4 *BS type 1-H*

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic limit*
in clause 6.6.5.5.1, the power summation emissions at the *TAB
connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not exceed a
limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

> 2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
> than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
> the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
> number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the antenna, RDN
and antenna array. The requirement shall apply during the transmitter ON
period and the *transmitter transient period*.

For *BS type 1-C*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *antenna connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *TAB connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, there are two types of transmitter intermodulation
cases captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the *BS type 1-H*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the co-location transmitter intermodulation
requirement is considered sufficient if the interference signal for the
co-location requirement is higher than the declared interference signal
for intra-system transmitter (D.30) intermodulation requirement.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.7.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.7.3.

### 6.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *single-band connectors* or *multi-band connector*
under test to restrict the generation of intermodulation products in its
nonlinear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna to below
specified levels.

### 6.7.4 Method of test

#### 6.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

#### 6.7.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.3.1. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.2 for *BS type 1-C*
and in annex D.3.2 for *BS type 1-H*. All connectors not under test
shall be terminated.

2\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* P~rated,c,AC~ for *BS type 1-C* and
P~rated,c,TABC~ for *BS type 1-H* (D.21). Channel set-up shall be
according to NR-FR1-TM 1.1.

> For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
> and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to
> transmit on all carriers configured using the applicable test
> configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7
> and 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical
> channels in clause 4.9.2.
>
> For a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band
> (D.41), test shall be performed using N-TM according to
> clause 4.9.2.2.9.

4\) Generate the interfering signal according to NR-FR1-TM-1.1, as
defined in clause 4.9.2, with the minimum channel bandwidth
(BW~Channel~) with 15 kHz SCS of the band defined in clause 5.3.5 of
TS 38.104 \[2\] and a centre frequency offset from the lower/upper edge
of the wanted signal or edge of sub-block inside a sub-block gap , for
n = 1, 2 and 3, but exclude interfering frequencies that are outside of
the allocated downlink operating band or interfering frequencies that
are not completely within the sub-block gap or within the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

5\) Adjust ATT attenuator (as in the test setup in annex D.1.2 for *BS
type 1-C* and in annex D.3.2 for *BS type 1-H*) so that level of the
interfering signal is as defined in clause 6.7.5.

6\) Perform the unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.6.3 and
6.6.4 for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which
appear in the frequency ranges defined in clauses 6.6.3 and 6.6.4. The
width of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

7\) Perform the transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in
clause 6.6.5, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products
which appear in the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.5. The width
of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

8\) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level in
clause 6.7.5 with the exception of interfering signal frequencies.

9\) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre
frequency offsets according to step 4.

10\) Repeat the test for the remaining test signals defined in
clause 6.7.5 for additional requirements and for *BS type 1-H*
intra-system requirements.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

11\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2 and
2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1±2F2,
3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal centre
frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents the
interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are:

> \- (n\*BW~F1~ + m\* BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;
>
> \- (n\* BW~F2~ + m\* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;

where BW~F1~ represents the test wanted signal RF bandwidth or channel
bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth and BW~F2~
represents the interfering signal channel bandwidth.

### 6.7.5 Test requirements

#### 6.7.5.1 BS type 1-C

##### 6.7.5.1.1 Co-location minimum requirements

For *BS type 1-C*, the wanted signal and interfering signal centre
frequency is specified in table 6.7.5.1.1-1, where interfering signal
level is *rated total output power* (P~rated,t,AC~) at *antenna
connector* in the *operating band* -- 30 dB.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.

For a *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each supported operating band. In
case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ MHz (where

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 6.6.3, 6.6.4 and 6.6.5 in the presence of an
NR interfering signal according to table 6.7.5.2.1-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the *sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* of each operating band. In case the
inter *RF Bandwidth* gap is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ MHz (where
BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS channel bandwidth* of the band), the
requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering signal offsets
where the interfering signal falls completely within the inter *RF
Bandwidth* gap.

 7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at the *antenna
connector* for *BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the configuration in
normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

> \- Requirements apply during the BS receive period.
>
> \- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.
>
> \- For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the
> transmitter unit(s) ON.
>
> \- Throughput requirements defined for the conducted receiver
> characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
>
> \- When BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
> throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
>
> \- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
> offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *Base
> Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block
> gap*, and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply
> relative to the upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block*
> edge inside a *sub-block gap*.

\- Requirements shall also apply for BS supporting NB-IoT operation in
NR in-band. The corresponding NB-IoT requirements are specified in
clause 7 of TS 36.141 \[24\].

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

For *BS type 1-H* if a number of *TAB connectors* have been declared
equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary to demonstrate
conformance.

In clause 7.6.5.3, if representative *TAB connectors* are used then per
connector criteria (option 2) shall be applied.

For BS type 1-H there is no requirement specified for band n46.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level
-------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB
connector* for *BS type 1-H* at which a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.2.2.

### 7.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that for the *BS type 1-C* receiver and each *BS type 1-H*
*TAB connector* at the reference sensitivity level the throughput
requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.4 Method of test

#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions 

Test environment:

\- Normal; see annex B.2.

\- Extreme, see annexes B.3 and B.5.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

Under extreme test environment, the test shall be performed on each of
B, M and T under extreme power supply conditions as defined in annex
B.5.

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.

#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

> 1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
> in annex D.2.1 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.1 for *BS type 1-H*.
>
> 2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit a signal using the
> applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
> specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models
> or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2, for *BS type 1-C* set the
> *antenna connector* to the manufacturers declared *rated carrier
> output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).
>
> 3\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit the
> Fixed Reference Channels for reference sensitivity according to annex
> A.1, as well as annex A.14 of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be
> capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band (D.41).
>
> 4\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal power as specified
> in clause 7.2.5.
>
> 5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex
> A.14 of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT
> operation in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

> 6\) For *multi-band connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.2.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.5-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 7.2.5-2 for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.2.5-3 for Local Area BS in any operating band except for
band n46 and n96.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.5-2a for Medium Range BS and in table 7.3.5-3a for Local
Area BS, for band n46.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.5-2b for Medium Range BS and in table 7.2.5-3b for Local
Area BS, for band n96.

The reference sensitivity level requirements for NB-IoT are specified in
clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.141 \[24\].

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

### 7.3.1 Definition and applicability

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector*
for *BS type 1-H* inside the received *BS channel bandwidth*. In this
condition, a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified
reference measurement channel. The interfering signal for the dynamic
range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.3.2.

### 7.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the *BS type 1-C* receiver and each *BS type 1-H* *TAB
connector* receiver dynamic range, the relative throughput shall fulfil
the specified limit.

### 7.3.4 Method of test

#### 7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.3.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.2 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.2 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.3.5-1 to table 7.3.5-3 according to the appropriate
BS class, as well as table 7.3.5-1a to table 7.3.5-3a for a BS declared
to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band (D.41).

3\) Set the Signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table 7.3.5-1
to table 7.3.5-3 according to the appropriate BS class, as well as table
7.3.5-1a to table 7.3.5-3a for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT
operation in NR in-band (D.41).

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2, as well as annex A.15
of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.3.5 Test requirements

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified
centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a
victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.4.1.2.

#### 7.4.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver filter to
suppress interfering signals in the channels adjacent to the wanted
channel.

#### 7.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 7.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC):

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

##### 7.4.1.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.1.5-1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.1.5-1 and 7.4.1.5-2.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

> 6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the
> steps above per involved band where single band test configurations
> and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other
> band.

#### 7.4.1.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *BS* *type
1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* are specified
in table 7.4.1.5-1 and the frequency offset between the wanted and
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2 for ACS. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in table 7.2.5-1, 7.2.5-2
and 7.2.5-3 for each channel bandwidth in any operating band except for
band n46 and n96 and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics
of the interfering signal is further specified in annex E.

For BS operating in band n46 and n96, the wanted and the interfering
signal coupled to the BS type 1-C antenna connector or BS type 1-H TAB
connector are specified in table 7.4.1.5-1a,7.4.1.5-1b and the frequency
offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2a for
ACS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in table 7.2.5-2a,7.2.5-3a and 7.2.5-3b for each BS channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1a. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

For BS supporting NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the wanted and the
interfering signal coupled to the *BS* *type 1-C* *antenna connector*
are specified in table 7.4.1.5-1 and the frequency offset between the
wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.141 \[24\]. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex E.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth
or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside any sub-block
gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the NR
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACS requirement shall apply in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
table 7.4.1.5‑2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap

Conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for *BS type
1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

The in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer, which is an NR signal
for general blocking or an NR signal with one resource block for
narrowband blocking.

#### 7.4.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.4.2.2.

#### 7.4.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to
withstand high-levels of in-band interference from unwanted signals at
specified frequency offsets without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

#### 7.4.2.4 Method of test

##### 7.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC) and/or CA:

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

##### 7.4.2.4.2 Procedure for general blocking

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.2.5-1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.2.5-1. The
interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz starting
from the minimum offset to the channel edges of the wanted signals as
specified in table 7.4.2.5-1.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.4.2.4.3 Procedure for narrowband blocking

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.2.5-2, as well as table 7.4.2.5-2a for a BS
declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band (D.41).

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.2.5-2 and 7.4.2.5-3,
as well as table 7.4.2.5-2a for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT
operation in NR in-band (D.41). Set-up and sweep the interfering RB
centre frequency offset to the channel edge of the wanted signal
according to table 7.4.2.5-3.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 7.4.2.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1‑H* *TAB connector* using
the parameters in tables 7.4.2.5-1, 7.4.2.5-2 and 7.4.2.5-3 for general
blocking and narrowband blocking requirements. Narrowband blocking
requirements are not applied for band n46 and n96. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.5
for each channel bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
E.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
and an interfering signal coupled to *BS type 1-C* *antenna connector*
using the parameters in tables 7.4.2.5-1, 7.4.2.5-2a and 7.4.2.5-3 for
general blocking and narrowband blocking requirements. The reference
measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.141 \[24\]. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex E.

The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H,* the in-band blocking requirement
applies from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding
the downlink frequency range of the *operating band*. The Δf~OOB~ for
*BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is defined in table 7.4.2.5-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

Table 7.4.2.5-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands*

  BS type         *Operating band* characteristics                 Δf~OOB~ (MHz)

  *BS type 1-C*   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 200 MHz              20
                  200 MHz \< F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60
  *BS type 1-H*   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ \< 100 MHz             20
                  100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz    60
                  100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz    60

For band n46 and n96, Δf~OOB~ is defined in table 7.4.2.5-0a.

  n96                    70

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the in-band blocking requirements apply in addition inside any
sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.4.2.5-1. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the blocking requirements apply in the
in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating band*.
The requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap,
in case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.4.2.5-1.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the
channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal in table 7.4.2.5-3. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement
applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal
in table 7.4.2.5-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking 
------------------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer out of the *operating
band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.5.2.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

To verify that the *BS type 1-C* receiver and each *BS type 1-H* *TAB
connector* receiver dynamic range, the relative throughput shall fulfil
the specified limit.

### 7.5.4 Method of test

#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC):

> \- M; see clause 4.9.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC):

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for a multi-band *connector:*

> \- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the
> highest operating band may be omitted.
>
> \- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the
> lowest operating band may be omitted.

#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.5 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit a signal according to
clause 4.9.2, connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

The transmitter may be turned off for the out-of-band blocker tests when
the frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall
inside the bandwidth of the wanted signal.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal as defined in
clause 7.5.5 to transmit as specified in table 7.5.5.1-1 and 7.5.5.2-1.

4\) Set the Signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.5.5.1-1 and 7.5.5.2-1.
The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz over
than range 1 MHz to (F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~) MHz and (F~UL\_high~ +
Δf~OOB~) MHz to 12750 MHz.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.5.5 Test requirements

#### 7.5.5.1 General requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* using
the parameters in table 7.5.5.1-1. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.2 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
and an interfering signal coupled to *BS type 1-C* *antenna connector*
using the parameters in table 7.5.5.1-1. The reference measurement
channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.5 of
TS 36.141 \[24\]. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex E.

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* the out-of-band blocking requirement
apply from 1 MHz to F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~
up to 12750 MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the FDD
*operating band* for BS supporting FDD. The Δf~OOB~ for or *BS type 1-C*
and *BS type 1-H* is defined in table 7.4.2.5-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the
out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each *operating band*,
with the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported *operating bands* according to clause 7.4.2.5 shall be
excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

#### 7.5.5.2 Co-location requirements

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of NR BS receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA BS or NR BS operating in
a different frequency band are co-located with a NR BS. The requirement
is applicable to all channel bandwidths supported by the NR BS.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and NR BS receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
BS antenna input using the parameters in table 7.5.5.2-1 for all the BS
classes. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in tables 7.2.5-1, 7.2.5-2 and 7.2.5-3 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1.

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* blocking requirement for co-location
with BS in other bands is applied for all operating bands for which
co-location protection is provided.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

co-located with BS in other frequency bands.

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector* (for *BS type 1-C*) or at the *TAB connector* (for *BS type
1-H*). The requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX *antenna
connectors* / *TAB connectors*.

> NOTE: In this case for FDD operation the test is performed when both
> TX and RX are ON, with the TX *antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors*
> terminated.

For a*ntenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
TDD, the requirements apply during the *transmitter OFF period*. For
*antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
FDD, the RX spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX
spurious emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.6.5.

For RX-only *multi-band* *connectors*, the spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*. For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF period*, and are subject to exclusion
zones in each supported *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* manufacturer shall declare *TAB connector RX min cell
groups* (D.33). Every *TAB connector* of *BS type 1‑H* supporting
reception in an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector RX min
cell group*, where mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells/beams is
implementation dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for *BS type
1-H* is calculated as follows:

> N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active~ , 8* *× N~cells~)*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~, where
N~cells~ is defined in clause 6.1.*

> NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units
> and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

### 7.6.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.6.2.

### 7.6.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to limit the
interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.

### 7.6.4 Method of test

#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

> \- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
> see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test,

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors* they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.4.4. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.6 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.4 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, for separate RX only connectors with single
carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit at
manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21). Channel set-up shall be according to NR-FR1-TM
1.1.

For FDD operation, for separate RX only connectors declared to be
capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the
connector under test to transmit on all carriers configured using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of
physical channels in clause 4.9.

> For separate RX only connectors declared to be capable of NB-IoT
> operation in NR in-band (D.41), test shall be performed using N-TM
> according to clause 4.9.2.2.9.

For TDD connectors capable of transmit and receive ensure the
transmitter is OFF.

> 3\) Set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in table
> 7.6.5.1-1.
>
> The measurement device characteristics shall be:
>
> \- Detection mode: True RMS.
>
> The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time
> duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement
> uncertainty in Table 4.1.2.3-1.

4\) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described
in table 7.6.5.1-1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.6.5 Test requirements

#### 7.6.5.1 Basic limits

#### 7.6.5.2 BS type 1-C

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-C* are that for
each *antenna connector,* the power of emissions shall not exceed *basic
limits* specified in table 7.6.5.1-1.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of RX spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C* shall not
exceed *basic limits* specified in table 7.6.5.1-1.The Rx spurious
emissions requirements shall apply to BS that support NR or NR with
NB-IoT operation in NR in-band.

#### 7.6.5.3 BS type 1-H

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.5.1-1 for each *TAB
connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at respective
*TAB connectors* shall not exceed the BS limits specified as the *basic
limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated
differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the BS.*

NOTE: Conformance to the BS receiver spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the BS limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the BS limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.7.2.

### 7.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to inhibit
the generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements
caused by the presence of two high-level interfering signals at
frequencies with a specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted
signal.

### 7.7.4 Method of test

#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC) and/or CA:

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.7 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.6 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.7.5-1 and 7.7.5-3.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.7.5-2 and 7.7.5-4.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.7.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the *BS type 1-C
antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector*, with the conditions
specified in tables 7.7.5-1 and 7.7.5-2 for intermodulation performance
in any operating band except for band n46 and n96, and 7.7.5-1a for band
n46 and n96 and in tables 7.7.5-3, and 7.7.5-4 for narrowband
intermodulation performance. Narrowband intermodulation requirements are
not applied for band n46 and n96. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in tables 7.2.5-1 to 7.2.5-3 for each
channel bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
E.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals
coupled to the *BS type 1-C antenna connector*, with the conditions
specified in tables 7.7.5-1 and 7.7.5-2 for intermodulation performance
and in tables 7.7.5-3, and 7.7.5-4 for narrowband intermodulation
performance. The reference measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted
signal is identified in clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.141 \[24\]. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
E.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall in
general be the same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal,
except for the case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and BS
channel bandwidth \<=20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the
interfering signal should be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the Base
Station RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or
Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition
inside any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at least as wide
as the channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal in table 7.7.5-2
or 7.7.5-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the intermodulation requirement applies
in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is
at least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in
case the gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
tables 7.7.5-2 and 7.7.5-4. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering
signal shall be an NR signal which is time aligned with the wanted
signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.8.2.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the BS receiver ability to
suppress the IQ leakage.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.8.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

> 1\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
> specified from table 7.8.5-1 to 7.8.5-3, as well as table 7.8.5-1a to
> 7.8.5-3a for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NR
> in-band (D.41).
>
> 2\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
> the frequency offset and as specified from table 7.8.5-1 to 7.8.5-3,
> as well as table 7.8.5-1a to 7.8.5-3a for a BS declared to be capable
> of NB-IoT operation in NR in-band (D.41).
>
> 3\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex
> A.14 of TS 36.141 \[24\] for a BS declared to be capable of NB-IoT
> operation in NR in-band (D.41).

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

> 4\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the
> steps above per involved band where single band test configurations
> and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other
> band.

### 7.8.5 Test requirements

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in annex A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.8.5-1 for Wide Area
BS, in table 7.8.5-2 for Medium Range BS in table 7.8.5-2b for Medium
Range BS for band n46 and in table 7.8.5-3 for Local Area BS in table
7.8.5-3b for Local Area BS for band n46, and in table 7.8.5-3c for Local
Area BS for band n96. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex E.

For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the NB-IoT reference measurement channel as
specified in Annex A of TS 36.141 \[24\] with parameters specified in
table 7.8.5-1a for Wide Area BS, in table 7.8.5-2a for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.8.5-3a for Local Area BS.

8 Conducted performance characteristics
=======================================

8.1 General
-----------

### 8.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-C* or *BS type 1-H* to correctly demodulate signals in various
conditions and configurations. Conducted performance requirements are
specified at the *antenna connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-C*) and at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the BS are specified for the
fixed reference channels and the propagation conditions defined in
TS 38.104 \[2\] annex A and annex H, respectively. The requirements only
apply to those FRCs that are supported by the BS.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting CA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *antenna connectors* (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in the *operating* *band*
turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions *antenna connectors* (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in FDD operation are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The associated
transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the tests.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided between the BS and the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

> S is the total signal energy in a slot on a single *antenna connector*
> (for *BS type 1-C*) or on a single *TAB connector* (for *BS type
> 1-H*).
>
> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the same duration where signal energy exists.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 8.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.2.

#### 8.2.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

#### 8.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by
two parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI part 1 and block
error probability of CSI part 2. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1
%, and the required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 2 not
exceeding 1 %.

The CSI part 1 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information is
sent.

The CSI part 2 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2 information is
sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 7 bits: 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2,

\- 40 bits: 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2.

The 7 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 c3 c4\] = \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is
mapping to the RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\]
for CSI part 2 information.

The 40 bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 are transmitted
simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.3.

#### 8.2.3.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI with CSI
part 1 and CSI part 2 bits multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading
propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to combination of SCS and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.2.3.4.2-1.

Table 8.2.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------
  **Sub-carrier spacing (kHz)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  **Channel bandwidth (MHz)**   **AWGN power level**
  30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             10                            -80.6 dBm / 8.64 MHz
  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                                 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the specific test parameters are configured as below. The
UCI information bit payload per slot is equal to 7 bits with CSI part 1
5bits, CSI part 2 2bit; and the UCI information bit payload per slot is
equal to 40 bits with CSI part 1 20bits, CSI part 2 20bits.

### 8.2.4 Performance requirements for PUSCH for high speed train

#### 8.2.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions. The performance
requirements for high speed train conditions are optional.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1 and clause 8.1.2.4.

The performance requirements for PUSCH for high speed train only apply
to Wide Area Base Stations and Medium Range Base Stations (Subject to
declaration).

#### 8.2.4.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.4.

#### 8.2.4.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under high speed train conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.4.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.4.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, channel
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors (depending
on HST scenario) for diversity reception via a combining network as
shown in annex D.5 and D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H*
respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.4.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                             
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------

### 8.2.5 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment

#### 8.2.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput measured for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance
requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario Y and scenario Z defined
in Annex G.4 are optional.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Table A.4-2B are applied for both UEs. The received power
for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are
consecutive. In Scenario Y and Scenario Z, Doppler shift is not taken
into account.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.5.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.5.

#### 8.2.5.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
measured for the moving UE at given SNR under moving propagation
conditions.

#### 8.2.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.5.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: MBW Channel CA; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for BS type 1-C and type 1-H respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to combination of SCS and

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

transport block error rate (BLER) for a given SNR. The required BLER is
defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the transport block
after reaching the maximum number of HARQ transmissions for the FRCs
listed in annex A.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.6.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.6.2.

#### 8.2.6.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve 0.001% BLER
under AWGN conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.6.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.6.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.6.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network as shown in annex D.5 and D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and
*type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.6.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.7 Performance requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

#### 8.2.7.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with slot aggregation factor
configured is determined by a maximum target BLER for a given SNR. The
required BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the
PUSCH information when the PUSCH information is sent for the FRCs listed
in annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.7.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.7.

#### 8.2.7.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve 1% BLER with
PUSCH repetition Type A under multipath fading propagation conditions
for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.7.4 Method of test

#### 8.2.7.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

#### 8.2.7.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.7.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.8 Performance requirements for PUSCH Mapping Type B with non-slot transmission

#### 8.2.8.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH mapping Type B is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex A.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.8.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.8.

#### 8.2.8.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput for
PUSCH mapping Type B with 2 symbol length allocated in time domain under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.8.4 Method of test

#### 8.2.8.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

#### 8.2.8.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.8.4.2-1.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 40                        -77.2 dBm / 38.16MHz
  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.9 Performance requirements for PUSCH msgA for 2-step RA type

#### 8.2.9.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of MsgA PUSCH is determined by a minimum
required block error rate of MsgA received by BS at given SNR for FRCs
listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume that the
precedent preamble of MsgA is correctly detected. The performance
requirements of assume no HARQ retransmission.

These requirements are applicable for wide area and medium range BS that
support 2-step RA type. The requirements are not applied for a local
area BS that supports 2-step RA type.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.9.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.9.

#### 8.2.9.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve maximum BLER
for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.9.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.9.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.9.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, channel
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.9.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                             
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameters in table 8.2.9.4.2-2.

4\) The channel simulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.3.

5\) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in table
8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-4 is achieved at the BS input.

6\) The test signal genentor send a MsgA including a preamble and PUSCH
signal and the receiver tries to detect the MsgA signal. The MsgA signal
is sent with a timing offset as described below.

The timing offset base value for MsgA signal is set to 0. For each newly
transmitted MsgA, this offset is increased within the loop. For 15 kHz
SCS, add a value of 0.2 us in each step until the end of the tested rage
which is 3.8 us. For 30 kHz SCS, add a value of 0.1 us in each step
until the end of tested rage which is 2 us. At the end of the testing
range, the offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA
transmission is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-1 for 30 kHz SCS and in
Figure 8.2.9.4.2-2 for 15 kHz SCS.

type 1-C and type 1-H with 15 kHz SCS

7\) For each of the reference channels in table 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-4
applicable for the base station, measure the BLER.

#### 8.2.9.5 Test Requirement

The BLER measured according to clause 8.2.9.4.2 shall not be below the
limits for the SNR levels specified in Table 8.2.9.5-1 to 8.2.9.5-4.
Unless stated otherwise, the MIMO correlation metrics for the gNB are
defined in Annex G for low correlation.

### 8.2.10 Requirements for interlaced PUSCH 

#### 8.2.10.1 Definition and applicability 

The performance requirement of PUSCH with interlace allocation is
determined by a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The
required throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for
the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ
retransmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.5.

#### 8.2.10.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.10.

#### 8.2.10.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR

#### 8.2.10.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.10.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.10.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.10.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.11 Performance requirements for CG-UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH

#### 8.2.11.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of CG-UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH is
determined by the parameter: block error probability (BLER) of CG-UCI.
The performance is measured by the required SNR at block error
probability of CG-UCI not exceeding 1 %.

The CG-UCI BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding
the CG-UCI information when the CG-UCI information is sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH, the UCI information
only contains CG-UCI information, there is no HACK/ACK, CSI part 1 or
CSI part 2 information transmitted.

The 18 bits CG-UCI information is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 ... c17\] as follows:

\- HARQ process number: \[c0 c1 c2 c3\] = \[ 0 0 0 1\]

\- RV sequence: \[c4 c5\] = \[0 0\]

\- NDI: \[c6\] = \[1\]

\- COT sharing information field: \[c7 c8 ... c17\] = \[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0\]

In the test, PUSCH data and CG-UCI are transmitted simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to BS is based on the test

8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.

#### 8.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test

#### 8.3.2.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

##### 8.3.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.2.2.4 Method of test

### 8.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 2

#### 8.3.3.1 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 2 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.3.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.4.

##### 8.3.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.3.1.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.3.1.4.1 Initial Condition

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier; M; see clause 4.9.1

###### 8.3.3.1.4.2 Procedure

#### 8.3.3.2 UCI BLER performance requirements

##### 8.3.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

##### 8.3.3.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.4.

##### 8.3.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.3.2.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.3.2.4.1 Initial Condition

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

#### 8.3.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

#### 8.3.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.6.

#### 8.3.5.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

##### 8.3.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.5.4.2-1.

### 8.3.6 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

#### 8.3.6.1 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1

##### 8.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection

###### 8.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of multi-slot PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK
to ACK detection equal to 0.1 % or less. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 1 % or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.4 Method of test

####### 8.3.6.1.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

####### 8.3.6.1.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the combinations of SCS and

###### 8.3.6.1.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

### 8.3.7 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.7.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user interlaced PUCCH format 0 for
ACK missed detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of
false detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The ACK missed detection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 0
with 1 UCI bits. The UCI information only contains ACK information

The 1bit UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[1\].

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.6.

#### 8.3.7.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.8.

### 8.3.8 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.8.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.8.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of interlaced PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK
to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when a NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The NACK to ACK deection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 1
with 2 UCI bits. The UCI information only contrains ACK/NACK information

The 2bits UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[0 1\].

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.6.

##### 8.3.8.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.9.

##### 8.3.8.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

#### 8.3.8.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.8.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of interlaced PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The ACK missed detection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 1
with 2 UCI bits. The UCI information only contains ACK/NACK information.

The 2bits UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[0 1\].

### 8.3.9 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 2

#### 8.3.9.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability (BLER) is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The UCI block error probability performance requirement only applies to
the PUCCH format 2 with 22 UCI bits.

The 22bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

### 8.3.10 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 3

#### 8.3.10.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of interlaced PUCCH format 3 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The ACK missed detection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 3
with 4 UCI bits. The UCI information only contains ACK information.

The 4bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap as \[1
1 1 1\].

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defines in clause 8.1.2.6.

#### 8.3.10.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.11.

#### 8.3.10.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.10.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.10.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

##### 8.3.10.4.2 Procedure

>
> 2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and
> channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.10.4.2-1.

8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
--------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection

#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is
determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection
of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd).
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.

Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection
of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input
is only noise.

Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble
when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several
error cases -- detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that
was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct
preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value.

For AWGN and TDLC300-100, and TDLA30-10, a timing estimation error
occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is
larger than the time error tolerance values given in table 8.4.1.1-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

4\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.

5\) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table
8.4.1.5-1 or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 or 8.4.1.6-1 or 8.4.1.6-2 or
8.4.1.6-3 or 8.4.1.6-4 or 8.4.1.7-1 or 8.4.1.7-2.

6\) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.4.1.5-1 or
8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 or 8.4.1.6-1 or 8.4.1.6-2 or 8.4.1.6-3 or
8.4.1.6-4 or 8.4.1.7-1 or 8.4.1.7-2 is achieved at the BS input during
the PRACH preambles.

7\) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to
detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure
8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as
described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of
preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed
preambles.

Figure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50%
of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step
a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us.
Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50%
of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is
presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.

Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4,
C0 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by
adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range,
which is 0.8 us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is
set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1,
A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-3.

######## Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the BS is to be tested are defined.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table B.1.

Table B.1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[6\];

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[7\];

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[8\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.1 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[9\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[10\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[11\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[9\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[10\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[9\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[10\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in annex B
shall be:

> Pressure: ±5 kPa
>
> Temperature: ±2 degrees
>
> Relative humidity: ±5 %
>
> DC voltage: ±1.0 %
>
> AC voltage: ±1.5 %
>
> Vibration: 10 %
>
> Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex F (normative): Void

######## Annex G (normative): Propagation conditions

G.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

> \- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\",
> characterized by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling
> grid. The profile can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay
> spread and the maximum delay spanned by the taps.
>
> \- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
> profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
> spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.
>
> \- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2
> (24.25 GHz -- 52.6 GHz).

G.2.1 Delay profiles
--------------------

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[20\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.1.1 can be used as such.

\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[20\].

\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays

\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[20\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge
the taps as follows

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2, G.2.1.1-3, and
G.2.1.1-4 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### G.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in G.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables G.2.1.1-2 \~ table G.2.1.1-4.

G.2.3 MIMO channel correlation matrices
---------------------------------------

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex G.2.3 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear arrays at both gNB and UE
and for the antenna configuration using cross polarized antennas.

### G.2.3.1 MIMO correlation matrices using Uniform Linear Array

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex G.2.3.1 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear array (ULA) at both gNB
and UE.

#### G.2.3.1.1 Definition of MIMO correlation matrices

Table G.2.3.1.1-1 defines the correlation matrix for the gNB.

G.2.3.1.1-3 defines the spatial correlation between the antennas at the

#### G.2.3.1.2 MIMO correlation matrices at high, medium and low level

The α and β for different correlation types are given in table
G.2.3.1.2-1.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in table G.2.3.1.2-2, G.2.3.1.2-3 and G.2.3.1.2-4 as below.

The values in table G.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](./media/image88.wmf)

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a = 0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a =
0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
table G.2.3.1.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision with a = 0.00012.

### G.2.3.2 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex G.2.3.2 apply to
two cases as presented below:

> \- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
> antennas used at gNB
>
> \- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
> polarized antennas used at both UE and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

#### G.2.3.2.1 Definition of MIMO correlation matrices using cross polarized antennas

![](./media/image102.wmf)

Where

> \- ![](./media/image103.wmf){width="0.3in" height="0.2in"} is the

G.3 High speed train condition
==============================

High speed train conditions are as follows:

\- Scenario 1-NR350 / Scenario 1-NR500: Open space

\- Scenario 3-NR350 / Scenario 3-NR500: Tunnel

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance
are two non-fading propagation channels. For BS with Rx diversity, the
Doppler shift time variation is the same for each antenna at each time
instant.

Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:

(G.3.1)

where is the Doppler shift and is the maximum Doppler frequency. The
cosine of angle is given by:

, (G.3.2)

, (G.3.3)

, (G.3.4)

where is the initial distance of the train from BS, and is BS-Railway
track distance, both in meters; is the velocity of the train in m/s, is
time in seconds.

The required input parameters are listed in table G.3-1 and G.3-2. The
resulting time varying Doppler shift is shown in Figure G.3-1, G.3-2,
G.3-3 and G.3-4 for 350km/h scenarios, and in Figure G.3-5, G.3-6, G.3-7
and G.3-8 for 500km/h scenarios. For 350km/h scenarios, the Doppler
shift was derived such that it corresponds to a velocity of around
350km/h for band n1 for the 15kHz SCS and for band n77 for the 30kHz
SCS. For 500km/h scenarios, the Doppler shift was derived such that it
corresponds to a velocity of around 500km/h for band n3 for the 15kHz
SCS and for band n77 for the 30kHz SCS. However, the same Doppler shift
requirement shall be applied regardless of the frequency of operation of
the base station and thus for lower frequencies, the supported speed is
higher.

of the UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the
reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (G.4-1). The
timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ -
(*T~A~* −31)×16×64*T~c~* for 15kHz SCS and Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×32*T~c~*

######## Annex H (normative): In-channel TX tests

H.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

H.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a FDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 30 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz
(*N*~RB~ = 273). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

H.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a
sampling rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it
is named $z\left( \upsilon \right)$. The *FFT size* is determined by the
transmission bandwidth in table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table
6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS. In the time
domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a signal with the
following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.5.3.5-3. The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of the *FFT
size* and SCS.

H.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols
are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain.

H.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency error

\- EVM

\- Resource element TX power

\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP)

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

H.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described
in figure H.2.4-1. The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT
and a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1
in figure H.2.4-1. The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT
size* + cyclic prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in
the \"Remove CP\" box. The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are
obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz
SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and
6.5.3.5-4. Table H.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and
the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two
symbols according to the sampling rate.

length for normal CP

                                     (symbol 0, slot 2)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic
prefix than the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length =
352).

H.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are
varied in order to minimise the difference between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the
amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

Note 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples inbetween the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

Note 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinuish between both.

After this process, the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.

H.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD,
there are $14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs performed where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of
symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2$, and

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2$.

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from tables 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS and
the transmission bandwidth.

The BS shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended for
EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal shall
be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as
follows, using $z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$:

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$, the timing is
known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is a Dirac peak and
that the correlation between the ideal signal
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and the data in the measured signal is 0.
The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest,
the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.

The number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$. This subset of samples is called
$z'\left( \upsilon \right)$.

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ is determined
according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal
CP, there are two values for $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ in a 1 ms
period:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = length of cylic prefix / 2,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = Longer CP length - length of cylic
prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS, and the longer CP length is obtained from table H.2.4-1.

As per the example values:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = 144 within the CP of length 288 for
OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = 208= 352 - 144) within the CP of
length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.

H.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on $z'\left( \nu \right)$ with the FFT window timing
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$. The result is called
$Z'\left( t,f \right)$. The RE TX power (RETP) is then defined as:

$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$

Where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$$OSTP = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}\sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$

Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
RETP values of all *N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not
containing PDCCH, RS or SSB within a slot.

From the acquired samples, $N_{\text{dl}}$ values for each OSTP can be
obtained and averaged where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval for FDD. For TDD, $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots with downlink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval
and is computed according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1.

For the example used in the annex, $N_{\text{dl}} = 20$ and
$N_{\text{RB}} = 273$.

H.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform$14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs on $z'\left( \nu \right)$, one for each
OFDM symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing
to produce an array of samples, $14N_{\text{dl}}$ in the time axis *t*
by *FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 280 FFTs are performed on
$z'\left( \nu \right)$. The result is an array of samples, 280 in the
time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$ and
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)\ $are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal $Z'\left( t,f \right)\ $and the post-FFT ideal signal
$I_{2}\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation reference signal, over
10 ms measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex
ratios:

$$a\left( t,f \right)e^{\text{jφ}\left( t,f \right)} = \frac{Z'\left( t,f \right)}{I_{2}\left( t,f \right)}$$

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of 2 \* π when
absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances $t_{i}$ are
greater than or equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

$$a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$$

> and

$$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$$

> Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signals time-domain
> locations $t_{i}$ from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation
> reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ at
the demodulation reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing
the moving average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged
demodulation reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window
size is 19 and averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated
RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when
the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously
allocated RBs is smaller than the moving average window size, the window
size is reduced accordingly as per figure H.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to
compute coefficients$\widetilde{\text{\ a}}\left( f \right)$,
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ for each subcarrier.

H.7 EVM
=======

### H.7.0 General

For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according
to the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer
coefficients from H.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ (annex H.2.2) and are called
$I\left( t,f \right)$.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

$$EVM = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$$

Where:

> \- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
> active within the slot,
>
> \- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource
> blocks with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol
> *t*,
>
> \- $I\left( t,f \right)$ *is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the
> measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,
>
> \- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under
> test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

H.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
------------------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval. The averaging in the time domain equals the
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slot duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the
equalizer estimation step.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ in the expressions
above and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ in the
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ calculation where (*l* and *h*,
low and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

Thus:

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.

H.7.2 Averaged EVM (TDD)
------------------------

Let $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with downlink
symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For TDD, the averaging in
the time domain can be calculated from $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$
slots of different 10 ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum
of $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots averaging length where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM
results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the
sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient
(RMS).

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the minimum
integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{\text{frame}}$
is determined by.

$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$

and $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for 30
kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.

Unite by RMS.

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{frame,k}^{2}}$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.

######## Annex I (normative): General rules for statistical testing

I.1 Testing methodology of PUSCH performance requirements with 0.001% BLER
==========================================================================

I.1.1 General
-------------

The test framework for the 0.001% BLER test is based upon examining
received blocks and determining pass, fail or continue each time a block
error occurs.

The pass/fail decision is made based on so-called decision co-ordinates
(ne, ns). ne is the number of block errors encountered during the test
and ns is the total number of received blocks during the test, up to the
current block error. The ns is compared with the nsp and nsf entries
corresponding to ne in table I.1.1-1. If ns is greater than the nsp
value in I.1.1-1, a pass may be declared. If ns is lower than the nsf
value, a fail may be declared. Otherwise, the test continues.

The objective of the approach is to minimize testing time and the basis
of the approach is an early termination statistical framework described
in clause I.1.3.1. The minimum testing time is defined by the possible
decision coordinates detailed in clause I.1.2.

As with all statistical tests, there is a non-zero risk of the test
result being incorrect due to statistical variations. There are two
possibilities for an incorrect decision:

\- As BS, whose BLER is greater than the requirement (i.e., the BS does
not comply to the requirement), is declared to pass the test.

\- A BS, whose BLER is lower than the requirement (i.e., a BS that does
comply to the requirement), is declared to fail the test.

The outcome of the statistical test is a decision. This decision may be
correct with confidence level of 99.999%, i.e., BSs whose BLER is
greater than 0.001% being declared to fail, and BSs whose BLER is
smaller or equal to 0.001% being declared to pass, or in-correct (as
detailed above).

I.1.3 Theory to derive the early pass/fail limits in I.1.2 (informative)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editor\'s note: This clause of the Annex I is for information only and
it describes the background theory and information for statistical
testing.

### I.1.3.1 Numerical definition of the pass-fail limits for testing PUSCH 0.001% BLER

A statistical test is characterized by test time, selectivity and
confidence level. The outcome of the statistical test is a decision.
This decision may be correct, i.e., BSs whose BLER is greater than
0.001% being declared to fail, and BSs whose BLER is smaller or equal to
0.001% being declared to pass, or in-correct (as detailed above). The
Confidence Level (CL) describes the probability that the decision is a
correct one. The complement is the wrong decision probability (risk) D =
1-CL.

When testing BLER, transport blocks or \"samples\" are observed and the
numbers of correctly and erroneously received blocks are recorded. For a
\"standard\" test, a pre-defined number of samples are observed, and a
pass/fail decision is made based on the number of observed errors being
above/below a threshold. This threshold is based on the targeted BLER
and the design target CL. There is always some risk of a statistical
variation leading to an incorrect pass/fail decision. The greater the
number of samples that are recorded, the lower is the risk of such an
error. The number of samples that are observed in a standard test is
dimensioned to achieve an acceptable low risk of error (i.e., an
acceptable high confidence level) for BS that just meet the BLER limit.

The standard test works well where the BLER level is relatively high and
confidence level relatively low (both are chosen to be on a comparable
order of magnitude). However, for ultra-low BLER testing the length of
time required for observing sufficient samples to achieve a 99.999%
confidence level is excessive. In many cases, the BS will in fact have a
much lower true BLER than the limit, i.e., design target of the test,
(in which case, the number of samples needed to achieve high confidence
that the BLER is lower than the limit is much smaller) or, if failing
the requirement will have a much higher true BLER (in which case, errors
occur more frequently and it can be demonstrated that the BS is above
the BLER limit with fewer samples).

To avoid long test times, an alternative test method called early
pass/fail is adopted. With the early pass/fail, each time a block error
is encountered, a decision is made on whether the BS can be
passed/failed with 99.999% CL or the test needs to continue until
another error is encountered. In the case of very good BSs, the test can
also be passed, when the number of samples permissible for one error
event is reached and no error event is recorded. Pass/Fail is decided
based on the total number of observed samples and errors, and a
statistical calculation based on an inverse binomial cumulative
distribution. The calculation involves one parameter, one variable and
the result:

\- Parameter: d (per step decision probability).

\- Variable: ne (number of observed errors).

\- Result: ns (number of expected samples for pass/fail, depending on
which one is calculated).

The per step decision probability risk, d, expresses the probability of
making an incorrect pass/fail decision in the current step (i.e., for
the current decision coordinate). d is determined by simulation such
that the overall risk of making a wrong decision over all steps of each
test of a large number of tests on a large number of BSs that exactly
meet the BLER limit is D=0.001% (and hence the CL 99.999%).

It should be noted that d is determined separately considering early
pass and early fail testing.

For a marginal BS (i.e., a BS almost exactly meeting the BLER), the
unmodified early pass/early fail approach is unable to distinguish
whether the BS has just passed or just failed the BLER (ε→0), and can
thus terminate with an \"undecided\" result. To avoid this undecided
result and provide selectivity, a so-called \"bad device factor\" (M) is
introduced into the early pass calculation. This factor biases the
decision towards avoiding failing good BS.

### I.1.3.2 Simulation to derive the pass-fail limits for testing PUSCH 0.001% BLER

There is freedom to design the decision co-ordinates (ne, ns), as
captured in clause I.1.2.

The binomial distribution and its inverse are used to design the pass
and fail limits. Note that this method is not unique and that other
methods exist.

Where

\- fail(..) is the error ratio for the fail limit.

\- pass(..) is the error ratio for the pass limit.

\- ER is the specified error ratio 1e-5.

\- ne is the number of bad results. This is the variable in both
equations.

\- M is the Bad DUT factor M=1.5.

\- d~f~ is the wrong decision probability of a single (ne, ns)
co-ordinate for the fail limit.\
It is found by simulation to be d~f~ = 2e-7.

\- cl~p~ is the confidence level of a single (ne, ns) co-ordinate for
the pass limit.\
It is found by simulation to be cl~p~ = 0.9999999.

\- qnbinom(..): The inverse cumulative function of the negative binomial
distribution.

The simulation works as follows:

\- A large population of limit DUTs with true ER = 1e-5 is decided
against the pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (99.999 %) of the population
passes and D (0.001 %) of the population fails.

\- A population of Bad DUTs with true ER = M\*1e-5 is decided against
the same pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (99.999 %) of the population
fails and D (0.001 %) of the population passes.

\- The number of DUTs decrease during the simulation, as the decided
DUTs leave the population. That number decreases with an approximately
exponential characteristics. After 642 bad results all DUTs of the
population are decided.

NOTE: The exponential decrease of the population is an optimal design
goal for the decision co-ordinates (ne, ns), which can be achieved with
other formulas or methods as well.
