Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR Base Station (BS) *Type 1-C* and *Type
1-H*. These have been derived from, and are consistent with the
conducted requirements for *BS Type 1-C* and *BS Type 1-H* in NR BS
specification defined in TS 38.104 \[2\].

A *BS type 1-C* only has conducted requirements so it requires
compliance to this specification only.

A *BS type 1-H* has both conducted and radiated requirements so it
requires compliance to the applicable requirements of this specification
and TS 38.141-2 \[3\].

*BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* have only radiated requirements so they
require compliance to TS 38.141-2 \[3\] only.

====================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1
of this specification, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1. The
frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of
TS 38.104 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.104 \[2\] and the references
therein. Test Tolerances for the conducted test requirements explicitly
stated in the present document are given in Annex C of the present
document.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

For *BS type 1-H* when a requirement is applied per *TAB connector* then
the test uncertainty is applied to the measured value. When a
requirement is applied for a group of *TAB connectors* then the test
uncertainty is applied to sum of the measured power on each *TAB
connector* in the group.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation
ITU-R M.1545 \[4\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this
may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure
that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1.2 had
been used.

4.2 Conducted requirement reference points
------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 *BS type 1-C*

*BS type 1-C* requirements are applied at the BS *antenna connector*
(port A) for a single transmitter or receiver with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If
any external apparatus such as an amplifier, a filter or the combination
of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far end *antenna
connector* (port B).

Figure 4.2.1-1: *BS type 1-C* transmitter interface

Figure 4.2.1-2: *BS type 1-C* receiver interface

### 4.2.2 *BS type 1-H*

*BS type 1-H* requirements are defined for two points of reference,
signified by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.

Figure 4.2.2-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *BS type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
*operating band* specific radiated interface is referred to as the
*Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which
the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

NOTE: Radiated conformance requirements are captured in
TS 38.141-2 \[3\] and are out of scope of this specification.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

4.3 Base station classes
------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated.

BS classes for *BS type 1-C* and 1-H are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
70 dB.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals
to 53 dB.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
45 dB.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

4.5 BS configurations
---------------------

### 4.5.1 *BS type 1-C*

#### 4.5.1.1 Transmit configurations

##### 4.5.1.1.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics in clause 6 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full
complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
conditions. If any external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter
or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the
far end antenna connector (test port B).

Figure 4.5.1.1.1-1: Transmitter test ports

##### 4.5.1.1.2 Transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each transmitter *antenna
connector* in the case of transmission with multiple transmitter
*antenna connectors*.

Transmitter requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the
remaining *antenna connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer
has declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent (D.32), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the transmitter *antenna
connectors*.

#### 4.5.1.2 Receive configurations

##### 4.5.1.2.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics in clause 7 are
specified at the BS *antenna connector* (test port A) with a full
complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
conditions. If any external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter
or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the
far end *antenna connector* (test port B).

Figure 4.5.1.2.1-1: Receiver test ports

##### 4.5.1.2.2 Reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, receiver diversity

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receiver *antenna connector* for receivers with antenna
diversity or in the case of multi-carrier reception with multiple
receiver *antenna connectors*.

Receiver requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the
remaining receiver(s) disabled or their *antenna connector(s)* being
terminated. If the manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be
equivalent (D.32), it is sufficient to apply the specified test signal
at any one of the receiver *antenna connectors*.

For a *BS type 1-C* supporting multi-band operation, multi-band tests
for ACS, blocking and intermodulation are performed with the
interferer(s) applied to each *antenna connector* mapped to the receiver
for the wanted signal(s), however only to one *antenna connector* at a
time. *Antenna connectors* to which no signals are applied are
terminated.

#### 4.5.1.3 Duplexers

The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer
fitted, if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is
supplied as an option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be
repeated with and without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.

The following tests shall be performed with the duplexer fitted, and
without it fitted if this is an option:

1\) Clause 6.2, base station output power, for the highest static power
step only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;

2\) Clause 6.6, unwanted emissions; outside the BS transmit band;

3\) Clause 6.6.5.5.1.2, protection of the BS receiver;

4\) Clause 6.7, transmit intermodulation; for the testing of
conformance, the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize
intermodulation products from the transmitters falling in receive
channels.

The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer
fitted.

NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is
important to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not
affect the test apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of
attenuators, isolators and filters.

NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be
generated, not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The
intermodulation products generated in the antenna system are not
controlled by 3GPP specifications, and may degrade during operation
(e.g. due to moisture ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued
satisfactory operation of a BS, an operator will normally select
NR-ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive
channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator may specify
the NR-ARFCNs to be used.

#### 4.5.1.4 Power supply options

If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be
supplied either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In
this case, the conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power
supply options can be tested by testing only the external DC supply
option. The range of DC input voltages for the test should be sufficient
to verify the performance with any of the power supplies, over its range
of operating conditions within the BS, including variation of mains
input voltage, temperature and output current.

#### 4.5.1.5 Ancillary RF amplifiers

The *BS type 1-C* requirements of the present document shall be met with
the ancillary RF amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7
for TX and RX respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the
BS by a connecting network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.)
with applicable loss to make sure the appropriate operating conditions
of the ancillary amplifier and the BS. The applicable connecting network
loss range is declared by the manufacturer (D.35). Other characteristics
and the temperature dependence of the attenuation of the connecting
network are neglected. The actual attenuation value of the connecting
network is chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme values.
The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.

Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted
and, if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify
that the BS meets the requirements of the present document in both
cases.

When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where \"x\"
denotes that the test is applicable:

NOTE 1: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The
amplifiers can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of
these amplifiers could be a passive network.

NOTE 2: Unless otherwise stated, BS with both TX and RX amplifiers are
tested once with both amplifiers active for each test.

In base station output power test (clause 6.2) and reference sensitivity
level test (clause 7.2) highest applicable attenuation value is applied.

### 4.5.2 *BS type 1-H*

#### 4.5.2.1 Transmit configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics in
clause 6 are specified at the *transceiver array boundary* at the *TAB
connector(s)* with a full complement of transceiver units for the
configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.5.2.1-1: Transmitter test ports

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each transmit *TAB connector.*

#### 4.5.2.2 Receive configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted receiver characteristics in
clause 7 are specified at the *TAB connector* with a full complement of
transceiver units for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.5.2.2-1: Receiver test ports

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receive *TAB connector*.

Conducted receive requirements are tested at the *TAB connector*, with
the remaining receiver units(s) disabled or their *TAB connector*(s)
being terminated.

#### 4.5.2.3 Power supply options

If the *BS type 1-H* is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.5.3 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the
integrated Iuant BS modem shall be switched OFF. Spurious emissions
according to clauses 6.6.5 and 7.6 shall be measured only for
frequencies above 20 MHz with the integrated Iuant BS modem switched ON.

### 4.7.3 NRTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of test configuration NRTC1 is to test all BS requirements
excluding CA occupied bandwidth.

For NRTC1 used in receiver tests only the two outermost carriers within
each supported operating band need to be generated by the test
equipment;

#### 4.7.3.1 NRTC1 generation

NRTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth supported for contiguous
spectrum operation (D.11) shall be used;

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. Place same signal
adjacent to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- For transmitter tests, select as many carriers (according to 4.7.2)
that the BS supports within an *operating band* and fit in the rest of
the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth (D.11). Place the
carriers adjacent to each other starting from the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge. The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 5.4.1 shall apply.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis for all component carriers of the inter-band CA bands declared to
be supported by the BS and are transmitted using the same *antenna
connector*. All configured component carriers are transmitted
simultaneously in the tests where the transmitter should be ON.

#### 4.7.3.2 NRTC1 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,AC~, or P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.4 NRTC2: Contiguous CA occupied bandwidth

NRTC2 in this clause is used to test CA occupied bandwidth.

#### 4.7.4.1 NRTC2 generation

The CA specific test configuration should be constructed on a per band
basis using the following method:

\- Of all component carrier combinations supported by the BS, those
which have smallest and largest sum of channel bandwidth of **component
carriers**, shall be tested. Of all component carrier combinations which
have smallest or largest sum of channel bandwidth of component carriers
supported by the BS, only one combination having largest sum and one
combination having smallest sum shall be tested irrespective of the
number of component carriers.

\- Of all **component carrier** combinations which have same sum of
channel bandwidth of **component carrier**, select those with the
narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing at the
lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- Of the combinations selected in the previous step, select one with
the narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing at
the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the smallest number of **component carrier**.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the lowest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the highest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the carrier which has been selected in the
previous step.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, repeat
the previous step until there is only one combination left.

\- The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

#### 4.7.4.2 NRTC2 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to be the same level so
that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,AC~, or P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) for NR according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.5 NRTC3: Non-contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of NRTC3 is to test all BS requirements excluding CA
occupied bandwidth.

For NRTC3 used in receiver tests, outermost carriers for each sub-block
need to be generated by the test equipment; other supported carriers are
optional to be generated.

#### 4.7.5.1 NRTC3 generation

NRTC3 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth supported for non-contiguous spectrum operation (D.11). The
Base Station RF Bandwidth consists of one sub-block gap and two
sub-blocks located at the edges of the declared maximum supported Base
Station RF Bandwidth (D.11).

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2. Place it adjacent
to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge and another carrier (as
described in 4.7.2) adjacent to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge.

\- For single-band operation receiver tests, if the remaining gap is at
least 15 MHz (or 60 MHz if channel bandwidth of the carrier to be tested
is 20 MHz) plus two times the channel BW used in the previous step and
the BS supports at least 4 carriers, place a carrier of this BW adjacent
to each already placed carrier for each sub-block. The nominal channel
spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.4.1 shall apply.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

#### 4.7.5.2 NRTC3 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the rated total output power (P~rated,t,AC~, or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration in
clause 4.6.

### 4.7.6 NRTC4: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

The purpose of NRTC4 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
maximum supported number of carriers.

#### 4.7.6.1 NRTC4 generation

NRTC4 is based on re-using the previously specified test configurations
applicable per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed
using the following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall
be the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth in multi-band
operation (D.12).

\- The number of carriers of each supported *operating band* shall be
the declared maximum number of supported carriers per operating band in
multi-band operation (D.18). Carriers shall be selected according to
4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the
Base Station RF Bandwidths edges, if possible.

\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall
be located at the outermost edges of the declared maximum Radio
Bandwidth.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to NRTC1, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. The mirror
image of the single-band test configuration shall be used in each
alternate band(s) and in the highest band being.

\- If only three carriers are supported, two carriers shall be placed in
one band according to the relevant test configuration while the
remaining carrier shall be placed at the edge of the maximum *Radio
Bandwidth* in the other band.

\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidths of each
supported *operating bands* is larger than the declared *Total RF
Bandwidth* BW~tot~ (D.13) of transmitter and receiver for the declared
band combinations of the BS, repeat the steps above for test
configurations where the Base Station RF Bandwidth of one of the
operating band shall be reduced so that the *Total RF Bandwidth* of
transmitter and receiver is not exceeded and vice versa.

\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carriers per operating
band in multi-band operation (D.18) is larger than the declared total
maximum number of supported carriers in multi-band operation (D.19),
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall
be reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not
exceeded and vice versa.

#### 4.7.6.2 NRTC4 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power (P~rated,t,AC~ or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported *operating band(s)* exceeds the
declared rated total output power of the *operating band(s)* in
multi-band operation, the exceeded part shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other band(s). If the power allocated for a carrier
exceeds the rated output power declared for that carrier, the exceeded
power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

### 4.7.7 NRTC5: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier

The purpose of NRTC5 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
higher PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and non-contiguous
operation (if supported) in multi-band mode.

#### 4.7.7.1 NRTC5 generation

NRTC5 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable
per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported *operating band*
shall be the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth in multi-band
operation (D.12).

\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall
be located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio
Bandwidth.

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall be selected according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth for outermost
bands and at the Base Station RF Bandwidths edges for middle band(s) if
any. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the Base Station RF
Bandwidths edges, if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to NRTC3, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest
supported NR channel bandwidth and smallest subcarrier spacing shall be
used in the test configuration.

\- If only one carrier can be placed for the concerned band(s), the
carrier(s) shall be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum radio bandwidth for outermost band(s) and at one of the
outermost edges of the supported frequency range within the Base Station
RF Bandwidths for middle band(s) if any.

\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared *Total RF Bandwidth* BW~tot~
(D.13) of transmitter and receiver for the declared band combinations of
the BS, repeat the steps above for test configurations where the Base
Station RF Bandwidth of one of the operating band shall be reduced so
that the *Total RF Bandwidth* BW~tot~ of transmitter and receiver is not
exceeded and vice versa.

#### 4.7.7.2 NRTC5 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the total rated output power (P~rated,t,AC~ or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported *operating band(s)* exceeds the
declared rated total output power of the *operating band(s)* in
multi-band operation, the exceeded part shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other band(s). If the power allocated for a carrier
exceeds the rated output power declared for that carrier, the exceeded
power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

### 4.8.4 Applicability of test configurations for *multi-band* operation

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the test
configuration in table 4.8.4-1 and/or table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for
testing. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on common
*multi-band connector*, the test configuration in the second column of
table 4.8.4-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped
on common *single-band connector*, the test configuration in table
4.8.3-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector*, the test
configuration in the third column of table 4.8.4-1 shall be used.

Unless otherwise stated, single carrier configuration (SC) tests shall
be performed using signal with narrowest supported channel bandwidth and
the smallest supported sub-carrier spacing.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single carrier testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the BS. These are denoted as RF channels B
(bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~
(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located in the middle of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

Occupied bandwidth test in this TS is performed with the *aggregated BS
channel bandwidth* and sub-block bandwidths located at the bottom,
middle and top of the supported frequency range in the operating band.
These are denoted as B~BW\ Channel\ CA~(bottom), M~BW\ Channel\ CA~
(middle) and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ (top) for contiguous spectrum operation.

Unless otherwise stated, the test for contiguous spectrum operation
shall be performed at B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and
T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ defined as following:

\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- M~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located close
in the middle of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- T~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in each operating band.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the
test shall be performed at B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~: the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and
at the highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
Maximum Radio Bandwidth, in the highest operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in the highest operating band and
at the lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
Maximum Radio Bandwidth, in the lowest operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands.
B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* are located at
the bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band
and at the top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating
band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation, B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~
for contiguous spectrum operation in each supported operating band, the
position of B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported
operating band combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

### 4.9.2 Test models

#### 4.9.2.1 General

The following clauses will describe the NR FR1 test models needed for
*BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*. Note that the NR FR1 test models are
also applicable to *BS type 1-O* conformance testing in
TS 38.141-2 \[3\].

#### 4.9.2.2 FR1 test models

The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according
to one of the NR FR1 test models (NR-FR1‑TM) below. A reference to the
applicable test model is made within each test.

The following general parameters are used by all NR test models:

\- Duration is 1 radio frame (10 ms) for FDD and 2 radio frames for TDD
(20 ms)

\- The slots are numbered 0 to 10×2^µ^ -- 1 where µ is the numerology
corresponding to the subcarrier spacing

\- N~RB~ is the maximum transmission bandwidth configuration seen in
table 5.3.2-1 in TS 38.104 \[2\].

\- Normal CP

\- Virtual resource blocks of localized type

For FR1-TDD, test models are derived based on the uplink/downlink
configuration as shown in the table 4.9.2.2-1 using information element
*TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon* as defined in TS 38.331 \[19\].

#### 4.9.2.3 Data content of Physical channels and Signals for NR-FR1-TM

Randomisation of the data content is obtained by utilizing a PN sequence
generator and the length-31 Gold sequence scrambling of
TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 5.2.1 which is invoked by all physical channels
prior to modulation and mapping to the RE grid.

Initialization of the scrambler and RE-mappers as defined in
TS 38.211 \[17\] use the following additional parameters:

\- $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 1$ for the lowest configured carrier,
$N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 2\ $for the 2^nd^ lowest configured
carrier,..., $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = n$ for the n^th^ configured
carrier.

\- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PDCCH.

\- *q* = 0 (single code word).

For NR-FR1-TM1.1 when used for TAE requirement of two layers MIMO
transmission:

\- Rank 2, two layers, no precoding.

\- Antenna ports starting with 1000 and 1001 for PDSCH.

Otherwise:

\- Rank 1, single layer.

\- Antenna port starting with 1000 for PDSCH.

##### 4.9.2.3.1 PDCCH

\- $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{CORESET}} = \ 2$.

\- PDCCH modulation to be QPSK as described in TS 38.211 \[17\],
clause 5.1.3.

\- For each slot the required amount of bits for all PDCCHs is as
follows: 1(\# of PDCCH) \* 1(\# of CCE per PDCCH) \* 6(REG per CCE) \*
9(data RE per REG) \* 2(bits per RE) with these parameters according to
the NR-FR1-TM definitions in clause 4.9.2.2.

\- Generate this amount of bits from the output of the PN23 sequence
generator \[23\]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with a
starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each frame.
The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries.

\- 1 CCE shall be according to TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.3.2 using
non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping. PDCCH occupies the first 2 symbols
for 6 resource-element groups, where a resource element group equals one
resource block during one OFDM symbol.

\- Perform PDCCH scrambling according to TS 38.211 \[17\],
clause 7.3.2.3.

\- $N_{\text{ID}} = N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ in DM-RS sequence
generation in TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.4.1.3.

\- $n_{\text{RNTI}} = 0$ in scrambling sequence generation in
TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.3.2.3.

\- Perform mapping to REs according to TS 38.211 \[17\], clause 7.3.2.5.

##### 4.9.2.3.2 PDSCH

\- Generate the required amount of bits from the output of the PN23
sequence generator \[23\]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with
a starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each
frame. The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries. For TDD
TMs, the PN sequence can be generated for all symbols (in the DL, UL or
special slots) or only DL symbols (in the DL or special slots). For TMs
with multi-users, the PN sequence can be generated per user (*n*~RNTI~
).

\- NR-FR1-TMs utilize 1, 2 or 3 user PDSCH transmissions distinguished
by $n_{\text{RNTI}}$. For each NR-FR1-TM, PRBs are mapped to user
($n_{\text{RNTI}}$) as follows:

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum
operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply
both at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the sub-block
gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges
respectively.

4.11 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
--------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band connector* the conducted test requirements in clause 6
and 7 apply separately to each supported *operating band* unless
otherwise stated. For some conducted test requirements, it is explicitly
stated that specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at
*multi-band connector(s)* as detailed in the requirement clause. For BS
capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations
(multi-band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more
*antenna* *connectors* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connectors* for *BS
type 1-H* in different ways are possible. For *multi-band connector(s)*
the exclusions or provisions for multi-band apply. For *single-band
connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this connector that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, *single-band
requirements* shall apply to this connector configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are
applicable. *Single-band requirements* are tested separately at the
connector configured for single-band operation, with all other
connectors terminated.

A *BS type 1-H* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations of *TAB
connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All TAB connectors are single-band connectors.

\- Different sets of single-band connectors support different operating
bands, but each TAB connector supports only operation in one single
operating band.

\- Sets of single-band connectors support operation in multiple
operating bands with some single-band connectors supporting more than
one operating band.

\- All TAB connectors are multi-band connectors.

\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of TAB
connectors provides support of the type BS type 1-H capability of
operation in multiple operating bands.

Unless otherwise stated all conducted test requirements specified for an
*operating band* apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting
that *operating band*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *single-band
connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group*, *single-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB
connectors*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *multi-band
connector*s supporting the same *operating band* combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

For *multi-band connectors* supporting the bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur between the bands.

NOTE 1: The case of an *operating band* being supported by both
*multi-band connectors* and *single-band connectors* in a *TAB connector
TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* is not covered
by the present release of this specification.

NOTE 2: The case of an *operating band* being supported by *multi-band
connectors* which are not all supporting the same *operating band*
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

NOTE 3: The conducted test requirements for *multi-band connectors*
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present
release of this specification.

4.12 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

**X Title**

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

**X.1 Definition and applicability**

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

**X.2 Minimum requirement**

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.

**X.3 Test purpose**

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

**X.4 Method of test**

**X.4.1 General**

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

**X.4.2y First test method**

**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up.

**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like domain (e.g.
frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms
(e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g.
average result from several measurement positions).

**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

**X.5 Test requirement**

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 (Interpretation of measurement results). Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the NR operating bands specification, their channel bandwidth
configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as synchronization
raster specification, refer to TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5 and its
relevant clauses.

For the conducted testing purposes in this specification, only FR1
operating bands are considered.

6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
=======================================

6.1 General
-----------

### 6.1.1 BS type 1-C

General test conditions for conducted transmitter tests are given in
clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results and
configurations for testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined
in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors* have
been declared equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary
to be tested to demonstrate conformance.

### 6.1.2 BS type 1-H

General test conditions for conducted transmitter tests are given in
clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results and
configurations for testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined
in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors* have
been declared equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary
to be tested to demonstrate conformance.

In clause 6.6.3.5.4, if representative *TAB connectors* are used then
per connector criteria (i.e. option 2) shall be applied.

*The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of
supported geographical cells (N~cells~, D.24) relates to the BS setting
with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with transmission on
all TAB connectors supporting the operating band. The manufacturer shall
also declare TAB connector TX min cell groups (D.34).* Every *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in an *operating band* shall map to
one *TAB connector TX min cell group* supporting the same *operating
band. The mapping of TAB connectors to cells is implementation
dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for BS type 1-H is
calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,\ counted~ = min(N~TXU,active~, 8·N~cells~)

*Further:*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~/N~cells~*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the *basic limits* as
described in clause 6.6.

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

6.2 Base station output power
-----------------------------

### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The conducted BS output power requirements are specified at *single-band
connector*, or at *multi-band connector*.

The *rated carrier output power* of the *BS type 1-C* shall be as

6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
-------------------------

### 6.4.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the BS.

filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the transmission
bandwidth configuration of the BS (BW~Config~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF period*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

For *multi-band connectors* and for *single band connectors* supporting
transmission in multiple operating bands, the requirement is only
applicable during the *transmitter OFF period* in all supported
operating bands.

For BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power is
defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth*
**BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2 during the
*transmitter OFF period*.** N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the *aggregated BS channel
bandwidth*.

#### 6.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.4.1.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.4.1.3.

#### 6.4.1.3 Test purpose

#### 6.4.1.5 Test requirements

The conformance testing of transmit OFF power is included in the
conformance testing of transmitter transient period; therefore, see
clause 6.4.2.5 for test requirements.

### 6.4.2 Transmitter transient period

#### 6.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

*Transmitter transient period* requirements apply only to TDD operation
of the BS.

The *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which the
transmitter unit is changing from the OFF period to the ON period or
vice versa. The *transmitter transient period* is illustrated in figure
6.4.2.1-1.

Figure 6.4.2.1-1: Illustration of the relations of transmitter ON

connectors* or *TAB connectors* may be tested in parallel as shown in
annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C* or in annex D.3.1 for *BS type 1-H*.
Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until all *antenna

have been tested.

1\) Connect *antenna connector* or *TAB connector* to measurement
equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C* or in annex D.3.1
for *BS type 1-H*. All *antenna connectors* or *TAB connectors* not
under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical
channels in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output

square filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the *antenna
connector* or *TAB connector* centred on the central frequency of the RF
bandwidth. 70/N μs average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end
of one transmitter ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next
transmitter ON period -- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier
Spacing in kHz.

4\) For an *antenna connector* or *TAB connector* supporting contiguous
CA, measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the *aggregated BS channel
bandwidth* BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2.
70/N μs average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end of one
transmitter ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next
transmitter ON period -- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the *aggregated BS channel
bandwidth*.

In addition, for *multi-band connector(s)*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

It is not possible to verify by testing that the data clock is derived
from the same frequency source as used for RF generation. This may be
confirmed by the manufacturer\'s declaration.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 6.5.1.2.

  Local Area BS     ±(0.1 ppm + 12 Hz)
  ----------------- ---------------------

### 6.5.3 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

\- NR-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by BS is 16QAM, or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.3 if highest modulation order supported by BS is QPSK.

For an *antenna connector* or *TAB connector* declared to be capable of
multi-carrier and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16), set the *antenna
connector* or the *TAB connector* under test to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on
all carriers configured:

\- NR-FR1-TM 3.1a if 256QAM is supported by BS without power back off,
or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.1a at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if
256QAM is supported by BS with power back off, and NR-FR1-TM3.1 at
maximum power, or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.1 if highest modulation order supported by BS is 64QAM, or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by BS is 16QAM, or

\- NR-FR1-TM3.3 if highest modulation order supported by BS is QPSK.

For NR-FR1-TM3.1a, power back-off shall be applied if it is declared.

2\) Measure the EVM and frequency error as defined in annex H.

3\) Repeat steps 1 and 2 for NR-FR1-TM2 if 256QAM is not supported by BS
or for NR-FR1-TM2a if 256QAM is supported by BS. For NR-FR1-TM2 and
NR-FR1-TM2a the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) shall be at the lower limit
of the dynamic range according to the test procedure in clause 6.3.3.4
and test requirements in clause 6.3.3.5.

In addition, for *multi-band connector(s)*, the following steps shall
apply:

4\) For *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.5.3.5 Test requirements

The EVM of each NR carrier for different modulation schemes on PDSCH
shall be less than the limits in table 6.5.3.5-1.

Table 6.5.3.5-1 EVM requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

  Modulation scheme for PDSCH   Required EVM (%)
  ----------------------------- ------------------
  QPSK                          18.5 %
  16QAM                         13.5 %
  64QAM                         9 %
  256QAM                        4.5 %

EVM shall be evaluated for each NR carrier over all allocated resource
blocks and downlink slots. Different modulation schemes listed in table
6.5.3.5-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

For all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for each NR
carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink slots within
10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM measurement periods
need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

Table 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3, 6.5.3.5-4 below specify the EVM window
length (*W*) for normal CP for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*.

aggregation and their combinations.

Frames of the NR signals present at the BS transmitter *antenna
connectors* or *TAB connectors* are not perfectly aligned in time and
may experience certain timing differences in relation to each other.

For *BS type 1-C*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to different *antenna connectors* for
a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-H*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to *TAB connectors* belonging to
different transmitter groups at the *transceiver array boundary*, where
transmitter groups are associated with the *TAB connectors* in the
transceiver unit array corresponding to MIMO transmission, *carrier
aggregation* for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 6.5.3.2.

#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

To verify that the time alignment error is within the limit specified by
the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-C* *antenna connectors* to be tested are for a specific
set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-H* *TAB connectors* to be tested are identified from the
declared sets of *TAB connector beam forming groups* in the TAE groups
declaration (D.31).

Compliance is to be demonstrated between all pairs of *single-band
connectors and/or multi-band connectors*, however it is not required to
exhaustively measure TAE between every combination of pairs of
representative connectors. Compliance can be demonstrated by comparison
of a reduced set of representative measurement results.

1\) Conducted measurement setup:

\- For *BS type 1-C*: Connect two *antenna connectors* to the
measurement equipment according to annex D.1.3. Terminate any unused
*antenna connector(s)*.

\- For *BS type 1-H*: Connect two representative *TAB connectors* one
from separate TAE group (D.31) to the measurement equipment according to
annex D.3.4. Terminate any unused *TAB connector(s).*

2\) Set the connectors under test to transmit NR-FR1-TM 1.1 or any DL
signal using MIMO transmission or carrier aggregation.

NOTE: For MIMO transmission, different ports may be configured in
NR-FR1-TM 1.1 (using *PDSCH DMRS ports 1000 and 1001*).

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models in clause 4.9.2 at *rated carrier output
power* (P~rated,c,AC~, or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

If the connector under test supports intra band contiguous or
non-contiguous CA, set the representative connectors to transmit using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

If the BS supports inter band CA, set the representative connectors to
transmit, for each band, a single carrier or all carriers, using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

For a connector declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation
(D.15), set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test signal
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7
and 4.8 using the corresponding test model in clause 4.9.2 on all
carriers configured.

4\) Measure the time alignment error between the different PDSCH
demodulation reference signals on different antenna ports belonging to
different connectorson the carrier(s) from the representative connectors
under test.

5\) Repeat step 1 - 4 for any other configuration of connectors, which
could be required to demonstrate compliance.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.5.4.5 Test requirement

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, TAE shall not exceed
90 ns.

For intra-band contiguous CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not exceed
285 ns.

For intra-band non-contiguous CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not
exceed 3.025 µs.

For inter-band CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not exceed 3.025 µs.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions in recommendation ITU-R
SM.329 \[5\]. In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted
emissions immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the operating band edge is Δf~OBUE~. The operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~
below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

Table 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  BS type         Operating band characteristics                   Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------ ----------------
  *BS type 1-C*   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 200 MHz              10
                  200 MHz \< F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_~low ≤ 900 MHz   40
  *BS type 1-H*   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ \< 100 MHz             10
                  100 MHz ≤ F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_~low ≤ 900 MHz    40

For *BS type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied per the
*TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the configurations supported
by the BS. The *basic limits* and corresponding emissions scaling are
defined in each relevant clause.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth 

#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[12\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be appliedat each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is in
TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 6.6.2

#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *antenna
connector or* *TAB connector* does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for
the service to be provided and is, therefore, not likely to create
interference to other users of the spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Aggregated BS channel bandwidth* positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~; see clause 4.9.1.

1\) Connect the measurement device to the BS *antenna connector* or *TAB
connector* as shown in annex D1.1 for *BS type 1-C* or D3.1 for *BS type
1-H*.

2\) For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation (D.16),
start transmission according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model NR-FR1-TM1.1 at
manufacturer\'s declared rated output power (P~rated,c,AC~, or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous CA operation, set the BS
to transmit according to NR-FR1-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.4 and 4.8.

##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in
table 6.6.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the
analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode must be power responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the
average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the
measurement cell.

2\) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the power outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total power outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005
times P0.

3\) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds
P1.

4\) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.

5\) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall
apply:

6\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single carrier test models shall apply,
with no carrier activated in the other band. In addition, when
contiguous CA is supported, single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirements

The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], table 5.3.5-1 for *BS type 1-C*
and *BS type 1-H*. For contiguous CA, t**he occupied bandwidth shall be
less than or equal to the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* as defined
in** TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.3A.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.6.3.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered (single
carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer\'s specification.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the ACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub block gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.5.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub block gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2
shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.5.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.

The requirement applies during the *transmitter ON period*.

#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.3.3.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.3.4.

#### 6.6.3.3 Test purpose

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.6.3.5.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.6.3.5.2-6.

For operation in non-contiguous spectrum or multiple bands, the CACLR
for NR carriers located on either side of the sub-block gap or the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap shall be higher than the value specified in table
6.6.3.5.2-4.

##### 6.6.3.5.3 *BS type 1-C*

The ACLR test requirements for *BS type 1-C* are given in table
6.6.3.5.2-1 or 6.6.3.5.2-3 applies per *antenna connector*. Conformance
can be shown by meeting the ACLR limit in table 6.6.3.5.2-1 or

##### For Band n41 operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be applied to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C*.6.6.3.5.4 *BS type 1-H*

The ACLR absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.5.2-2+ X (where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~)) or the ACLR *limits* in table

Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* ACLR (CACLR) limit can be demonstrated
by meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the
manufacturer:

### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of
each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑1 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. In addition, for a BS operating in non-contiguous
spectrum, the requirements apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition,
for a BS operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

B*asic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is
specified in the clauses 6.6.4.5.2 to 6.6.4.5.5below, where in this
case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
*basic limits* apply also in a supported operating band without any
carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted
in another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative *basic
limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink
operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink
operating band without any carrier transmitted and:

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~, f\_offset~max~
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and the operating
band unwanted emission *basic limit* of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause,
shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits*
of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the
tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~),
shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band connector* or a *single-band connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier
aggregation the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier
transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the
carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified
frequency band.

In addition inside any sub-block gap for a *single-band connector*
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, a combined *basic limit* shall be
applied which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified for
the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The *basic
limit* for each sub block is specified in the clauses 6.6.4.5.2 to
6.6.4.5.5 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Wide Area BS, the requirements of either clause 6.6.4.5.2 (Category
A limits) or clause 6.6.4.5.3 (Category B limits) shall apply.

For Medium Range BS, the requirements in clause 6.6.4.5.4 shall apply
(Category A and B).

For Local Area BS, the requirements of clause 6.6.4.5.5 shall apply
(Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B *basic limits* shall
be the same as for transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.6.5.

#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.4.3.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.4.4.

#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.3.1. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C*
or in annex D.3.1 for *BS type 1-H*. All connectors not under test shall
be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

2\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the representative connectors under test to transmit according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated carrier
output power* P~rated,c,AC~ for *BS type 1-C* and P~rated,c,TABC~ for
*BS type 1-H* (D.21). Channel set-up shall be according to NR-FR1-TM
1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation set the connector under test to transmit on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For connector under test
declared to operate in multiple bands or non-contiguous spectrum, the
emission within the *Inter RF Bandwidth* or *sub-block gap* shall be
measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF
Bandwidth or sub block edge.

4\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases, with the channel
set-up according to NR-FR1-TM 1.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

> 5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
> steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
> configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated
> in the other *operating band*.

##### 6.6.4.5.6 Basic limits for additional requirements

###### 6.6.4.5.6.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.4.5.2 to 6.6.4.5.5, the
BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by
FCC Title 47 \[13\], when deployed in regions where those limits are
applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.

###### 6.6.4.5.6.2 Protection of DTT

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *BS type 1-C* or *BS type 1-H* operating in Band n20, the level
of emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter
bandwidth on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table
6.6.4.5.6.2-1, *basic limit* is P~EM,N~ declared by the manufacturer.
This requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though
part of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Table 6.6.4.5.6.2-1: Declared emissions *basic limit* for protection of
DTT

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Filter centre frequency, F~filter~   Measurement bandwidth   Declared emission *basic limit* (dBm)
  ------------------------------------ ----------------------- ---------------------------------------
  F~filter~ = 8\*N + 306 (MHz);\       8 MHz                   P~EM,N~
  21 ≤ N ≤ 60                                                  

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain
and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the BS needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined
using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[22\], Annex G.

###### 6.6.4.5.6.3 (void)

##### 6.6.4.5.7 *BS type 1-C*

The operating band unwanted emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each
*antenna connector* shall be below the applicable *basic limits* defined
in clauses 6.6.4.5.2 -- 6.6.4.5.6.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted emissions
limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over all
*antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C.*

##### 6.6.4.5.8 *BS type 1-H*

The operating band unwanted emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are
that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable
*basic limit* in clauses 6.6.4.5.2 -- 6.6.4.5.6, the power summation
emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell
group* shall not exceed a BS limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*,
where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1. For some *operating
bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with
the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating band*, as specified
in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[5\].

For a *multi-band connector*, each supported *operating band* together
with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter spurious
emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

For operation in region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in
FCC Title 47 \[13\] is applicable, N~TXU,countedpercell~ shall be equal
to one for the purposes of calculating the spurious emissions limits in
clauses 6.6.5. For all other unwanted emissions requirements,
N~TXU,countedpercell~ shall be the value calculated according to
clause 6.1.

#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.5.3.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.6.5.4.

#### 6.6.5.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.6.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~;
see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below F~DL\_low~ -
Δf~OBUE~; T~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies above
F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below
F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ of the lowest operating band; B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
when testing the spurious frequencies above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ of
the highest operating band in multi-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.5.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.3.1. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *BS type 1-C*
and in annex D.3.1 for *BS type 1-H*. All connectors not under test
shall be terminated.

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.6.5.5.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~, or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21). Channel
set-up shall be according to NR-FR1-TM 1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

###### 6.6.5.5.1.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of the BSs being desensitised by emissions from a
BS transmitter. It is measured at the transmit *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* or at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H* for any type
of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx *antenna* *connectors* / *TAB
connectors*.

The *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.5.1.2-1.

Table 6.6.5.5.1.2-1: BS spurious emissions *basic limits* for protection
of the BS receiver

  BS class          Frequency range             Basic limit   Measurement bandwidth
  ----------------- --------------------------- ------------- -----------------------
  Wide Area BS                                  -96 dBm       
  Medium Range BS   F~UL\_low~ -- F~UL\_high~   -91 dBm       100 kHz
  Local Area BS                                 -88 dBm       

###### 6.6.5.5.1.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink *operating band*. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.4.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the *basic limits*
of table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with
the system listed in the first column apply. For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.5.5.1.3-1 apply for each supported *operating band*.

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in
table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range
immediately outside the downlink *operating band* (see TS 38.104 \[2\],
table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be
covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where
the frequency ranges in TS 38.104 \[2\], table 5.2-1 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a
case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent *operating bands* can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may
apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For Band n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band
27 UL *operating band*.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.6.1.

The *basic limits* for this requirement is:

Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-2: BS spurious emissions *basic limits* for BS for
co-existence with PHS

  Frequency range        Basic limit   Measurement bandwidth   Note
  ---------------------- ------------- ----------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1884.5 -- 1915.7 MHz   -41 dBm       300 kHz                 Applicable when co-existence with PHS system operating in 1884.5 - 1915.7 MHz

Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-3: Void

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating
in Band n50 and n75 within 1432-1452 MHz, and in Band n51 and Band n76.
The *basic limits* are specified in table 6.6.5.5.1.3-4. This
requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the BS downlink *operating
band*.

Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-4: Additional operating band unwanted emission *basic

  --------------------------------- ------------- -----------------------
  F~filter~ = 1413.5 MHz            -42 dBm       27 MHz

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating
in NR Band n50 within 1492-1517 MHz. The maximum level of emissions,
measured on centre frequencies F~filter~ with filter bandwidth according
to table 6.6.5.5.1.3-5, shall be defined according to the *basic limits*
P~EM,n50,a~ and P~EM,B50,b~ declared by the manufacturer.

Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-5: Operating band n50, n74 and n75 declared emission
above 1518 MHz

  Filter centre frequency, F~filter~    Declared emission *basic limit* (dBm)   Measurement bandwidth

  1518.5 MHz ≤ F~filter~ ≤ 1519.5 MHz   P~EM,\ n50,a~                           1 MHz
  1520.5 MHz ≤ F~filter~ ≤ 1558.5 MHz   P~EM,n50,b~                             1 MHz

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in ECC/DEC/(17)06 \[14\], is
defined in terms of EIRP, which is dependent on both the BS emissions at
the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in
TS 38.104 \[2\], Annex E.

The following requirement may apply to BS for Band n41 operation in
Japan. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up
to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating
band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

Table 6.6.5.5.1.3-6: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band
n41

  Frequency range                                                               *Basic limit*   *Measurement Bandwidth*
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- -------------------------
  2505 MHz -- 2535 MHz                                                          -42 dBm         1 MHz
  NOTE: This requirement applies for carriers allocated within 2545-2645 MHz.                   

###### 6.6.5.5.1.4 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class.

The *basic limits* are in table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 for a BS where
requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column
apply, depending on the declared BS class (D.2). For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.5.5.1.4-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the BS transmit
frequency range of a downlink *operating band* (see TS 38.104 \[2\]
table 5.2-1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are
certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques
are addressed in TR 25.942 \[15\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.5.1.4-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where
the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in
TS 38.104 \[2\] table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in
the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent *operating band* can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

##### 6.6.5.5.2 (void)

##### 6.6.5.5.3 *BS type 1-C*

The Tx spurious emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each *antenna connector*
shall not exceed the *basic limits* specified in clause 6.6.5.5.1.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious emissions over
all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C* shall not exceed the *basic
limits* defined in clause 6.6.5.5.1.

##### 6.6.5.5.4 *BS type 1-H*

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic limit*
in clause 6.6.5.5.1, the power summation emissions at the *TAB
connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not exceed a
limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the antenna, RDN
and antenna array. The requirement shall apply during the transmitter ON
period and the *transmitter transient period*.

For *BS type 1-C*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *antenna connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *TAB connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, there are two types of transmitter intermodulation
cases captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the *BS type 1-H*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the co-location transmitter intermodulation
requirement is considered sufficient if the interference signal for the
co-location requirement is higher than the declared interference signal
for intra-system transmitter (D.30) intermodulation requirement.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.7.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 6.7.3.

### 6.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *single-band connectors* or *multi-band connector*
under test to restrict the generation of intermodulation products in its
nonlinear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna to below
specified levels.

### 6.7.4 Method of test

#### 6.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the test
shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and only
with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

#### 6.7.4.2 Procedure

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.3.1. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.2 for *BS type 1-C*
and in annex D.3.2 for *BS type 1-H*. All connectors not under test
shall be terminated.

2\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* P~rated,c,AC~ for *BS type 1-C* and
P~rated,c,TABC~ for *BS type 1-H* (D.21). Channel set-up shall be
according to NR-FR1-TM 1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

4\) Generate the interfering signal according to NR-FR1-TM-1.1, as
defined in clause 4.9.2, with the minimum channel bandwidth
(BW~Channel~) with 15 kHz SCS of the band defined in clause 5.3.5 of
TS 38.104 \[2\] and a centre frequency offset from the lower/upper edge
of the wanted signal or edge of sub-block inside a sub-block gap , for
n = 1, 2 and 3, but exclude interfering frequencies that are outside of
the allocated downlink operating band or interfering frequencies that
are not completely within the sub-block gap or within the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

5\) Adjust ATT attenuator (as in the test setup in annex D.1.2 for *BS
type 1-C* and in annex D.3.2 for *BS type 1-H*) so that level of the
interfering signal is as defined in clause 6.7.5.

6\) Perform the unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.6.3 and
6.6.4 for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which
appear in the frequency ranges defined in clauses 6.6.3 and 6.6.4. The
width of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

7\) Perform the transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in
clause 6.6.5, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products
which appear in the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.5. The width
of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

8\) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level in
clause 6.7.5 with the exception of interfering signal frequencies.

9\) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre
frequency offsets according to step 4.

10\) Repeat the test for the remaining test signals defined in
clause 6.7.5 for additional requirements and for *BS type 1-H*
intra-system requirements.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

11\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2 and
2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1±2F2,
3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal centre
frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents the
interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are:

\- (n\*BW~F1~ + m\* BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;

\- (n\* BW~F2~ + m\* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;

where BW~F1~ represents the test wanted signal RF bandwidth or channel
bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth and BW~F2~
represents the interfering signal channel bandwidth.

### 6.7.5 Test requirements

#### 6.7.5.1 BS type 1-C

##### 6.7.5.1.1 Co-location minimum requirements

For *BS type 1-C*, the wanted signal and interfering signal centre
frequency is specified in table 6.7.5.1.1-1, where interfering signal
level is *rated total output power* (P~rated,t,AC~) at *antenna
connector* in the *operating band* -- 30 dB.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.

For a *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each supported operating band. In
case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ MHz (where
BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS channel bandwidth* of the band), the
requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering signal offsets
where the interfering signal falls completely within the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 6.6.3, 6.6.4 and 6.6.5 in the presence of an
NR interfering signal according to table 6.7.5.1.1-1.

7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at the *antenna
connector* for *BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the configuration in
normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements apply during the BS receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the transmitter
unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the conducted receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a
*sub-block gap*.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

For *BS type 1-H* if a number of *TAB connectors* have been declared
equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary to demonstrate
conformance.

In clause 7.6.5.3, if representative *TAB connectors* are used then per
connector criteria (option 2) shall be applied.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level
-------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB
connector* for *BS type 1-H* at which a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.2.2.

### 7.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that for the *BS type 1-C* receiver and each *BS type 1-H*
*TAB connector* at the reference sensitivity level the throughput
requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.4 Method of test

#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions 

Test environment:

\- Normal; see annex B.2.

\- Extreme, see annexes B.3 and B.5.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

Under extreme test environment, the test shall be performed on each of
B, M and T under extreme power supply conditions as defined in annex
B.5.

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.

#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.1 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.1 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit a signal using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of
physical channels in clause 4.9.2, for *BS type 1-C* set the *antenna
connector* to the manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power*
(P~rated,c,AC~ or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

3\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit the
Fixed Reference Channels for reference sensitivity according to annex
A.1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal power as specified in
clause 7.2.5.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.2.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.5-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 7.2.5-2 for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.2.5-3 for Local Area BS.

  NOTE: P~REFSENS~ is the power level of a single instance of the reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.                                                                                                                        

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

### 7.3.1 Definition and applicability

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector*
for *BS type 1-H* inside the received *BS channel bandwidth*. In this
condition, a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified
reference measurement channel. The interfering signal for the dynamic
range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 7.3.2.

### 7.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the *BS type 1-C* receiver and each *BS type 1-H* *TAB
connector* receiver dynamic range, the relative throughput shall fulfil
the specified limit.

### 7.3.4 Method of test

#### 7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.3.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.2 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.2 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.3.5-1 to table 7.3.5-3 according to the appropriate
BS class.

3\) Set the Signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table 7.3.5-1
to table 7.3.5-3 according to the appropriate BS class.

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2.

In addition, for a *multi-band connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.3.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 7.3.2-2 for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.3.2-3 for Local Area BS.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified
centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a
victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.4.1.2.

#### 7.4.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver filter to
suppress interfering signals in the channels adjacent to the wanted
channel.

#### 7.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 7.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC):

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

##### 7.4.1.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.1.5-1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.1.5-1 and 7.4.1.5-2.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

> 6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the
> steps above per involved band where single band test configurations
> and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other
> band.

#### 7.4.1.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *BS* *type
1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* are specified
in table 7.4.1.5-1 and the frequency offset between the wanted and
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2 for ACS. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in table 7.2.5-1, 7.2.5-2
and 7.2.5-3 for each channel bandwidth and further specified in annex
A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified
in annex E.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth
or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside any sub-block
gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the NR
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACS requirement shall apply in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
table 7.4.1.5‑2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap

Conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for *BS type
1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

The in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer, which is an NR signal
for general blocking or an NR signal with one resource block for
narrowband blocking.

#### 7.4.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.4.2.2.

#### 7.4.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to
withstand high-levels of in-band interference from unwanted signals at
specified frequency offsets without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

#### 7.4.2.4 Method of test

##### 7.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC) and/or CA:

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

##### 7.4.2.4.2 Procedure for general blocking

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.2.5-1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.2.5-1. The
interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz starting
from the minimum offset to the channel edges of the wanted signals as
specified in table 7.4.2.5-1.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.4.2.4.3 Procedure for narrowband blocking

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.2.5-2.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.2.5-2 and 7.4.2.5-3.
Set-up and sweep the interfering RB centre frequency offset to the
channel edge of the wanted signal according to table 7.4.2.5-3.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 7.4.2.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1‑H* *TAB connector* using
the parameters in tables 7.4.2.5-1, 7.4.2.5-2 and 7.4.2.5-3 for general
blocking and narrowband blocking requirements. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.5 for each
channel bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
E.

The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H,* the in-band blocking requirement
applies from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding
the downlink frequency range of the *operating band*. The Δf~OOB~ for
*BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is defined in table 7.4.2.5-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

Table 7.4.2.5-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands*

  BS type         *Operating band* characteristics                 Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------ ---------------
  *BS type 1-C*   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 200 MHz              20
                  200 MHz \< F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60
  *BS type 1-H*   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ \< 100 MHz             20
                  100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz    60

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the in-band blocking requirements apply in addition inside any
sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.4.2.5-1. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the blocking requirements apply in the
in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating band*.
The requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap,
in case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.4.2.5-1.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the
channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal in table 7.4.2.5-3. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement
applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal
in table 7.4.2.5-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking
------------------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer out of the *operating
band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.5.2.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

To verify that the *BS type 1-C* receiver and each *BS type 1-H* *TAB
connector* receiver dynamic range, the relative throughput shall fulfil
the specified limit.

### 7.5.4 Method of test

#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC):

\- M; see clause 4.9.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC):

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for a multi-band *connector:*

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the
highest operating band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the lowest
operating band may be omitted.

#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.5 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.3 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit a signal according to
clause 4.9.2, connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

The transmitter may be turned off for the out-of-band blocker tests when
the frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall
inside the bandwidth of the wanted signal.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal as defined in
clause 7.5.5 to transmit as specified in table 7.5.5.1-1 and 7.5.5.2-1.

4\) Set the Signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.5.5.1-1 and 7.5.5.2-1.
The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz over
than range 1 MHz to (F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~) MHz and (F~UL\_high~ +
Δf~OOB~) MHz to 12750 MHz.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.5.5 Test requirements

#### 7.5.5.1 General requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* using
the parameters in table 7.5.5.1-1. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.2 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1.

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* the out-of-band blocking requirement
apply from 1 MHz to F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~
up to 12750 MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the FDD
*operating band* for BS supporting FDD. The Δf~OOB~ for or *BS type 1-C*
and *BS type 1-H* is defined in table 7.4.2.5-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the
out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each *operating band*,
with the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported *operating bands* according to clause 7.4.2.5 shall be
excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

  NOTE: P~REFSENS~ depends on the *BS channel bandwidth* as specified in TS 38.104 \[2\], table 7.2.2-1, 7.2.2-2 and 7.2.2-3.                                         
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------- ----------------------------

#### 7.5.5.2 Co-location requirements

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of NR BS receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA BS or NR BS operating in
a different frequency band are co-located with a NR BS. The requirement
is applicable to all channel bandwidths supported by the NR BS.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and NR BS receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
BS antenna input using the parameters in table 7.5.5.2-1 for all the BS
classes. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in tables 7.2.5-1, 7.2.5-2 and 7.2.5-3 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1.

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* blocking requirement for co-location
with BS in other bands is applied for all operating bands for which
co-location protection is provided.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector* (for *BS type 1-C*) or at the *TAB connector* (for *BS type
1-H*). The requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX *antenna
connectors* / *TAB connectors*.

> NOTE: In this case for FDD operation the test is performed when both
> TX and RX are ON, with the TX *antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors*
> terminated.

For a*ntenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
TDD, the requirements apply during the *transmitter OFF period*. For
*antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
FDD, the RX spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX
spurious emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.6.5.

For RX-only *multi-band* *connectors*, the spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*. For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF period*, and are subject to exclusion
zones in each supported *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* manufacturer shall declare *TAB connector RX min cell
groups* (D.33). Every *TAB connector* of *BS type 1‑H* supporting
reception in an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector RX min
cell group*, where mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells/beams is
implementation dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for *BS type
1-H* is calculated as follows:

N~RXU,counted~ = min(N~RXU,active~ , 8 × N~cells~)

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~, where
N~cells~ is defined in clause 6.1.*

> NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units
> and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

### 7.6.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.6.2.

### 7.6.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to limit the
interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.

### 7.6.4 Method of test

#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1,

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test,

For *BS type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors* they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.4.4. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.6 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.4 for *BS type 1-H*.

> 2\) For FDD operation for separate RX only connectors with single
> carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit at
> manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
> P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21). Channel set-up shall be according to NR-FR1-TM
> 1.1.
>
> For FDD operation for separate RX only connectors declared to be
> capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the
> connector under test to transmit on all carriers configured using the
> applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
> specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models
> or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.

For TDD connectors capable of transmit and receive ensure the
transmitter is OFF.

> 3\) Set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in table
> 7.6.5.1-1.
>
> The measurement device characteristics shall be:
>
> \- Detection mode: True RMS.
>
> The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time
> duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement
> uncertainty in Table 4.1.2.3-1.

4\) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described
in table 7.6.5.1-1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.6.5 Test requirements

#### 7.6.5.1 Basic limits

The receiver spurious emissions limits are provided in table 7.6.5.1-1.

#### 7.6.5.2 BS type 1-C

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-C* are that for
each *antenna connector,* the power of emissions shall not exceed *basic
limits* specified in table 7.6.5.1-1.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, the sum of RX spurious emissions over
all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C* shall not exceed *basic
limits* specified in table 7.6.5.1-1.

#### 7.6.5.3 BS type 1-H

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.5.1-1 for each *TAB
connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at respective
*TAB connectors* shall not exceed the BS limits specified as the *basic
limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated
differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the BS.*

NOTE: Conformance to the BS receiver spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the BS limit above for the respective frequency span.

or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the BS limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.7.2.

### 7.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to inhibit
the generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements
caused by the presence of two high-level interfering signals at
frequencies with a specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted
signal.

### 7.7.4 Method of test

#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC) and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.7 for *BS type 1-C* and in annex D.4.6 for *BS type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~ or
P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.7.5-1 and 7.7.5-3.

4\) Set the signal generator(s) for the interfering signals to transmit
at the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.7.5-2 and 7.7.5-4.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.7.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the *BS type 1-C
antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector*, with the conditions
specified in tables 7.7.5-1 and 7.7.5-2 for intermodulation performance
and in tables 7.7.5-3, and 7.7.5-4 for narrowband intermodulation
performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in tables 7.2.5-1 to 7.2.5-3 for each channel bandwidth and
further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex E.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall in
general be the same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal,
except for the case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and BS
channel bandwidth \<=20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the
interfering signal should be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the Base
Station RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or
Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition
inside any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at least as wide
as the channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal in table 7.7.5-2
or 7.7.5-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the intermodulation requirement applies
in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is
at least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in
case the gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
tables 7.7.5-2 and 7.7.5-4. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering
signal shall be an NR signal which is time aligned with the wanted
signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* are in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.8.2.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the BS receiver ability to
suppress the IQ leakage.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.8.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *BS type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1:

1\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified from table 7.8.5-1 to 7.8.5-3.

2\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified from table 7.8.5-1 to 7.8.5-3.

3\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

4\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.8.5 Test requirements

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in annex A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.8.5-1 for Wide Area
BS, in table 7.8.5-2 for Medium Range BS and in table 7.8.5-3 for Local
Area BS. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex E.

8 Conducted performance characteristics
=======================================

8.1 General
-----------

### 8.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-C* or *BS type 1-H* to correctly demodulate signals in various
conditions and configurations. Conducted performance requirements are
specified at the *antenna connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-C*) and at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the BS are specified for the
fixed reference channels and the propagation conditions defined in
TS 38.104 \[2\] annex A and annex H, respectively. The requirements only
apply to those FRCs that are supported by the BS.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting CA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *antenna connectors* (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in the *operating* *band*
turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions *antenna connectors* (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in FDD operation are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The associated
transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the tests.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided between the BS and the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a single *antenna connector*
(for *BS type 1-C*) or on a single *TAB connector* (for *BS type 1-H*).

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the same duration where signal energy exists.

### 8.1.2 Applicability rule

#### 8.1.2.0 General

Unless otherwise stated, for a BS supporting more than 8 antenna
connectors (for *BS type 1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*)
(see D.37 in table 4.6-1), the performance requirement tests for 8 RX
antennas shall apply, and the specific connectors used for testing are
based on manufacturer declaration.

Unless otherwise stated, for a BS supporting different numbers of
antenna connectors (for *BS type 1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type
1-H*) (see D.37 in table 4.6-1), the tests with low MIMO correlation
level shall apply only for the lowest and highest numbers of supported
connectors, and the specific connectors used for testing are based on
manufacturer declaration.

#### 8.1.2.1 Applicability of PUSCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.2.1.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.14 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the BS
supports it (see D.14 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.2.1.3 Applicability of requirements for different configurations

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
the mapping type declared to be supported (see D.100 in table 4.6-1). If
both mapping type A and type B are declared to be supported, the tests
shall be done for either type A or type B; the same chosen mapping type
shall then be used for all tests.

8.1.2.1.4 Applicability of requirements for uplink carrier aggregation

The tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall be carried out according
to the declaration (see D.107 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, the tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall
apply only for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled, and shall be
conducted on per component carrier basis.

8.1.2.1.5 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL
patterns

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if BS supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of the
supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

#### 8.1.2.2 Applicability of PUCCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.2.2.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PUCCH format declared to be supported (see D.102 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.2.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.14 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.2.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported by the BS, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the BS
supports it (see D.14 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.2.2.4 Applicability of requirements for different configurations

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 3 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.104 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 4 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.105 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

##### 8.1.2.2.5 Applicability of requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

Unless otherwise stated, multi-slot PUCCH requirement tests shall apply
only if the BS supports it (see D.106 in table 4.6-1).

#### 8.1.2.3 Applicability of PRACH performance requirements 

##### 8.1.2.3.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats

Unless otherwise stated, PRACH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PRACH format declared to be supported (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.3.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, for each PRACH format with short sequence
declared to be supported, for each FR, the tests shall apply only for
the smallest supported subcarrier spacing in the FR (see D.103 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.3.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

Unless otherwise stated, for the subcarrier spacing to be tested, the
test requirements shall apply only for anyone channel bandwidth declared
to be supported (see D.14 in table 4.6-1).

8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

#### 8.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.1.

#### 8.2.1.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 8.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.2.

#### 8.2.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel
bandwidth, defined in table 8.2.2.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

#### 8.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by
two parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI part 1 and block
error probability of CSI part 2. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1
%, and the required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 2 not
exceeding 1 %.

The CSI part 1 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information is
sent.

The CSI part 2 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2 information is
sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 7 bits: 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2,

\- 40 bits: 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2.

The 7 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 c3 c4\] = \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is
mapping to the RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\]
for CSI part 2 information.

The 40 bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 are transmitted
simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.2.3.

#### 8.2.3.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI with CSI
part 1 and CSI part 2 bits multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading
propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to combination of SCS and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.2.3.4.2-1.

Table 8.2.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------
  **Sub-carrier spacing (kHz)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  **Channel bandwidth (MHz)**   **AWGN power level**
  30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             10                            -80.6 dBm / 8.64 MHz
  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                                 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the specific test parameters are configured as below. The
UCI information bit payload per slot is equal to 7 bits with CSI part 1
5bits, CSI part 2 2bit; and the UCI information bit payload per slot is
equal to 40 bits with CSI part 1 20bits, CSI part 2 20bits.

8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.

#### 8.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: single carrier M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.3.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth and
sub-carrier spacing defined in table 8.3.1.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

##### 8.3.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 8.3.2.1.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

###### 8.3.2.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the combinations of SCS and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.2.1.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

#### 8.3.2.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

##### 8.3.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.2.2.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 8.3.3.2 UCI BLER performance requirements

##### 8.3.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

##### 8.3.3.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.4.

##### 8.3.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.3.2.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.3.2.4.1 Initial Condition

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

###### 8.3.3.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth
defined in table 8.3.3.2.4.2-1.

### 8.3.4 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

#### 8.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

#### 8.3.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.5.

#### 8.3.4.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.4.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

##### 8.3.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.4.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

#### 8.3.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[21\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

#### 8.3.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.6.

#### 8.3.5.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

##### 8.3.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.5 and
D.6 for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* respectively.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.5.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.3.6 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

#### 8.3.6.1 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1

##### 8.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection

###### 8.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of multi-slot PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK
to ACK detection equal to 0.1 % or less. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 1 % or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.6.1.2 ACK missed detection

###### 8.3.6.1.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

###### 8.3.6.1.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

###### 8.3.6.1.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
--------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection

#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is
determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection
of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd).
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.

Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection
of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input
is only noise.

Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble
when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several
error cases -- detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that
was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct
preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value.

For AWGN and TDLC300-100, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the
time error tolerance values given in table 8.4.1.1-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

4\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.

5\) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table
8.4.1.5-1 or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3.

6\) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.4.1.5-1 or
8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 is achieved at the BS input during the PRACH
preambles.

7\) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to
detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure
8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as
described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of
preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed
preambles.

Figure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50%
of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step
a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us.
Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50%
of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is
presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.

Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4,
C0 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by
adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range,
which is 0.8 us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is
set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format A1,
A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-3.

######## Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the BS is to be tested are defined.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table B.1.

Table B.1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[6\];

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[7\];

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[8\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.1 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[9\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[10\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[11\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[9\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[10\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[9\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[10\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in annex B
shall be:

> Pressure: ±5 kPa
>
> Temperature: ±2 degrees
>
> Relative humidity: ±5 %
>
> DC voltage: ±1.0 %
>
> AC voltage: ±1.5 %
>
> Vibration: 10 %
>
> Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex F (normative): Void

######## Annex G (normative): Propagation conditions

G.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

> \- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\",
> characterized by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling
> grid. The profile can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay
> spread and the maximum delay spanned by the taps.
>
> \- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
> profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
> spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.
>
> \- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2
> (24.25 GHz -- 52.6 GHz).

G.2.1 Delay profiles
--------------------

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[20\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.1.1 can be used as such.

\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[20\].

\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays

\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[20\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge
the taps as follows

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

NOTE 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2, G.2.1.1-3, and
G.2.1.1-4 for the corresponding model.

NOTE 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### G.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in G.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in table G.2.3.1.2-2, G.2.3.1.2-3 and G.2.3.1.2-4 as below.

The values in table G.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](./media/image81.wmf)

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a = 0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a =
0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
table G.2.3.1.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision with a = 0.00012.

### G.2.3.2 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex G.2.3.2 apply to
two cases as presented below:

> \- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
> antennas used at gNB
>
> \- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
> polarized antennas used at both UE and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

######## Annex H (normative): In-channel TX tests

H.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

H.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a FDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 30 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz
(*N*~RB~ = 273). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

H.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a
sampling rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it
is named $z\left( \upsilon \right)$. The *FFT size* is determined by the
transmission bandwidth in table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table
6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS. In the time
domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a signal with the
following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.5.3.5-3. The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of the *FFT
size* and SCS.

H.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols
are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain.

H.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency error

\- EVM

\- Resource element TX power

\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP)

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

H.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described
in figure H.2.4-1. The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT
and a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1
in figure H.2.4-1. The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT
size* + cyclic prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in
the \"Remove CP\" box. The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are
obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz
SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and
6.5.3.5-4. Table H.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and
the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two
symbols according to the sampling rate.

Table H.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP
length for normal CP

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SCS (kHz)   \# slots in subframe   Symbol \# and slot \# with longer CP   Longer CP length
  ----------- ---------------------- -------------------------------------- ------------------------------
  15          1                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 128
                                     (symbol 7, slot 0)                     

  30          2                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 64
                                     (symbol 0, slot 1)                     

  60          4                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 32
                                     (symbol 0, slot 2)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic
prefix than the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length =
352).

Figure H.2.4-1: Reference point for FR1 EVM measurements

H.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are
varied in order to minimise the difference between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the
amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples inbetween the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinuish between both.

After this process, the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.

H.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD,
there are $14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs performed where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of
symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2$, and

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2$.

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from tables 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS and
the transmission bandwidth.

The BS shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended for
EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal shall
be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as
follows, using $z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$:

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$, the timing is
known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is a Dirac peak and
that the correlation between the ideal signal
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and the data in the measured signal is 0.
The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest,
the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.

The number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$. This subset of samples is called
$z'\left( \upsilon \right)$.

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ is determined
according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal
CP, there are two values for $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ in a 1 ms
period:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = length of cylic prefix / 2,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = Longer CP length - length of cylic
prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS, and the longer CP length is obtained from table H.2.4-1.

As per the example values:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 144$ within the CP of length 288 for
OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 208$ (= 352 - 144) within the CP of
length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.

H.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on $z'\left( \nu \right)$ with the FFT window timing
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$. The result is called
$Z'\left( t,f \right)$. The RE TX power (RETP) is then defined as:

$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$

Where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$\text{OSTP} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}\sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$

Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
RETP values of all *N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not
containing PDCCH, RS or SSB within a slot.

From the acquired samples, $N_{\text{dl}}$ values for each OSTP can be
obtained and averaged where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval for FDD. For TDD, $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots with downlink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval
and is computed according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1.

For the example used in the annex, $N_{\text{dl}} = 20$ and
$N_{\text{RB}} = 273$.

H.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform$14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs on $z'\left( \nu \right)$, one for each
OFDM symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing
to produce an array of samples, $14N_{\text{dl}}$ in the time axis *t*
by *FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 280 FFTs are performed on
$z'\left( \nu \right)$. The result is an array of samples, 280 in the
time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$ and
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)\ $are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal $Z'\left( t,f \right)\ $and the post-FFT ideal signal
$I_{2}\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation reference signal, over
10 ms measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex
ratios:

$a\left( t,f \right)e^{\text{jφ}\left( t,f \right)} = \frac{Z'\left( t,f \right)}{I_{2}\left( t,f \right)}$

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of 2 \* π when
absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances $t_{i}$ are
greater than or equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

$a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$

and

$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$

Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signals time-domain
locations $t_{i}$ from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation
reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ at
the demodulation reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing
the moving average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged
demodulation reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window
size is 19 and averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated
RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when
the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously
allocated RBs is smaller than the moving average window size, the window
size is reduced accordingly as per figure H.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to
compute coefficients$\widetilde{\text{\ a}}\left( f \right)$,
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ for each subcarrier.

H.7 EVM
=======

### H.7.0 General

For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according
to the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$ , using the equalizer
coefficients from H.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ (annex H.2.2) and are called
$I\left( t,f \right)$.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$

Where:

> \- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
> active within the slot,
>
> \- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource
> blocks with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol
> *t*,
>
> \- $I\left( t,f \right)$ *is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the
> measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,
>
> \- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under
> test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

H.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
------------------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval. The averaging in the time domain equals the
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slot duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the
equalizer estimation step.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ in the expressions
above and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ in the
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ calculation where (*l* and *h*,
low and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

Thus:

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.

H.7.2 Averaged EVM (TDD)
------------------------

Let $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with downlink
symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For TDD, the averaging in
the time domain can be calculated from $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$
slots of different 10 ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum
of $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots averaging length where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM
results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the
sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient
(RMS).

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the minimum
integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{\text{frame}}$
is determined by.

$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$

and $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for 30
kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.

Unite by RMS.

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.
