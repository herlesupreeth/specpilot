4 General description of RRC\_IDLE state and RRC\_INACTIVE state
================================================================

4.1 Overview
------------

The RRC\_IDLE state and RRC\_INACTIVE state tasks can be subdivided into
three processes:

\- PLMN selection;

\- Cell selection and reselection;

\- Location registration and RNA update.

PLMN selection, cell reselection procedures, and location registration
are common for both RRC\_IDLE state and RRC\_INACTIVE state. RNA update
is only applicable for RRC\_INACTIVE state. When UE selects a new PLMN,
UE transitions from RRC\_INACTIVE to RRC\_IDLE, as specified in TS
24.501 \[14\].

When a UE is switched on, a public land mobile network (PLMN) is
selected by NAS. For the selected PLMN, associated RAT(s) may be set, as
specified in TS 23.122 \[9\]. The NAS shall provide a list of equivalent
PLMNs, if available, that the AS shall use for cell selection and cell
reselection.

With cell selection, the UE searches for a suitable cell of the selected
PLMN, chooses that cell to provide available services, and monitors its
control channel. This procedure is defined as \"camping on the cell\".

The UE shall, if necessary, then register its presence, by means of a
NAS registration procedure, in the tracking area of the chosen cell. As
an outcome of a successful Location Registration, the selected PLMN then
becomes the registered PLMN, as specified in TS 23.122 \[9\].

If the UE finds a more suitable cell, according to the cell reselection
criteria, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it. If the new cell
does not belong to at least one tracking area to which the UE is
registered, location registration is performed. In RRC\_INACTIVE state,
if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, an RNA update
procedure is performed.

If necessary, the UE shall search for higher priority PLMNs at regular
time intervals as described in TS 23.122 \[9\] and search for a suitable
cell if another PLMN has been selected by NAS.

If the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN, either a new PLMN is
selected automatically (automatic mode), or an indication of available
PLMNs is given to the user so that a manual selection can be performed
(manual mode).

Registration is not performed by UEs only capable of services that need
no registration.

The purpose of camping on a cell in RRC\_IDLE state and RRC\_INACTIVE
state is fourfold:

a\) It enables the UE to receive system information from the PLMN.

b\) When registered and if the UE wishes to establish an RRC connection
or resume a suspended RRC connection, it can do this by initially
accessing the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is
camped.

c\) If the network needs to send a message or deliver data to the
registered UE, it knows (in most cases) the set of tracking areas (in
RRC\_IDLE state) or RNA (in RRC\_INACTIVE state) in which the UE is
camped. It can then send a \"paging\" message for the UE on the control
channels of all the cells in the corresponding set of areas. The UE will
then receive the paging message and can respond.

d\) It enables the UE to receive ETWS and CMAS notifications.

When the UE is in RRC\_IDLE state, upper layers may deactivate AS layer
when MICO mode is activated as specified in TS 24.501 \[14\]. When MICO
mode is activated, the AS configuration (e.g. priorities provided by
dedicated signalling) is kept and all running timers continue to run but
the UE need not perform any idle mode tasks. If a timer expires while
MICO mode is activated it is up to the UE implementation whether it
performs the corresponding action immediately or the latest when MICO
mode is deactivated. When MICO mode is deactivated, the UE shall perform
all idle mode tasks.

4.2 Functional division between AS and NAS in RRC\_IDLE state and RRC\_INACTIVE state
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 4.2-1 presents the functional division between UE non-access
stratum (NAS) and UE access stratum (AS) in RRC\_IDLE state and
RRC\_INACTIVE states. The NAS part is specified in TS 23.122 \[9\] and
the AS part in the present document.

4.3 Service types in RRC\_IDLE state
------------------------------------

This clause defines the level of service that may be provided by the
network to a UE in RRC\_IDLE state. The following three levels of
services are provided while a UE is in RRC\_IDLE state:

\- Limited service (emergency calls, ETWS and CMAS on an acceptable
cell);

\- Normal service (for public use on a suitable cell);

\- Operator service (for operators only on a reserved cell).

4.4 Service types in RRC\_INACTIVE state
----------------------------------------

This clause defines the level of service that may be provided by the
network to a UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state. The following two levels of
services are provided while a UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state:

\- Normal service (for public use on a suitable cell);

\- Operator service (for operators only on a reserved cell).

4.5 Cell Categories
-------------------

The cells are categorised according to which services they offer:

**acceptable cell:**

An \"acceptable cell\" is a cell on which the UE may camp to obtain
limited service (originate emergency calls and receive ETWS and CMAS
notifications). Such a cell shall fulfil the following requirements,
which is the minimum set of requirements to initiate an emergency call
and to receive ETWS and CMAS notification in an NR network:

\- The cell is not barred, see clause 5.3.1;

\- The cell selection criteria are fulfilled, see clause 5.2.3.2.

**suitable cell:**

A cell is considered as suitable if the following conditions are
fulfilled:

\- The cell is part of either the selected PLMN or the registered PLMN
or PLMN of the Equivalent PLMN list;

\- The cell selection criteria are fulfilled, see clause 5.2.3.2.

According to the latest information provided by NAS:

\- The cell is not barred, see clause 5.3.1;

\- The cell is part of at least one TA that is not part of the list of
\"Forbidden Tracking Areas\" (TS 22.261 \[12\]), which belongs to a PLMN
that fulfils the first bullet above.

**barred cell:**

A cell is barred if it is so indicated in the system information, as
specified in TS 38.331 \[3\].

**reserved cell:**

A cell is reserved if it is so indicated in system information, as
specified in TS 38.331 \[3\].

Following exception to these definitions are applicable for UEs:

\- if a UE has an ongoing emergency call, all acceptable cells of that
PLMN are treated as suitable for the duration of the emergency call.

\- camped on a cell that belongs to a registration area that is
forbidden for regional provision of service; a cell that belongs to a
registration area that is forbidden for regional provision service (TS
23.122 \[9\], TS 24.501 \[14\]) is suitable but provides only limited
service.

5 Process and procedure descriptions
====================================

5.1 PLMN selection
------------------

In the UE, the AS shall report available PLMNs to the NAS on request
from the NAS or autonomously.

During PLMN selection, based on the list of PLMN identities in priority
order, the particular PLMN may be selected either automatically or
manually. Each PLMN in the list of PLMN identities is identified by a
\'PLMN identity\'. In the system information on the broadcast channel,
the UE can receive one or multiple \'PLMN identity\' in a given cell.
The result of the PLMN selection performed by NAS (see TS 23.122 \[9\])
is an identifier of the selected PLMN.

### 5.1.1 Support for PLMN selection

#### 5.1.1.1 General

On request of the NAS, the AS shall perform a search for available PLMNs
and report them to NAS.

#### 5.1.1.2 NR case

The UE shall scan all RF channels in the NR bands according to its
capabilities to find available PLMNs. On each carrier, the UE shall
search for the strongest cell and read its system information, in order
to find out which PLMN(s) the cell belongs to. If the UE can read one or
several PLMN identities in the strongest cell, each found PLMN (see the
PLMN reading in TS 38.331 \[3\]) shall be reported to the NAS as a high
quality PLMN (but without the RSRP value), provided that the following
high-quality criterion is fulfilled:

1\. For an NR cell, the measured RSRP value shall be greater than or
equal to -110 dBm.

Found PLMNs that do not satisfy the high-quality criterion but for which
the UE has been able to read the PLMN identities are reported to the NAS
together with their corresponding RSRP values. The quality measure
reported by the UE to NAS shall be the same for each PLMN found in one
cell.

The search for PLMNs may be stopped on request from the NAS. The UE may
optimise PLMN search by using stored information e.g. frequencies and
optionally also information on cell parameters from previously received
measurement control information elements.

Once the UE has selected a PLMN, the cell selection procedure shall be
performed in order to select a suitable cell of that PLMN to camp on.

#### 5.1.1.3 E-UTRA case

Support for PLMN selection in E-UTRA is described in TS 36.304 \[7\].

5.2 Cell selection and reselection
----------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Introduction

UE shall perform measurements for cell selection and reselection
purposes as specified in TS 38.133 \[8\].

When evaluating Srxlev and Squal of non-serving cells for reselection
evaluation purposes, the UE shall use parameters provided by the serving
cell and for the final check on cell selection criterion, the UE shall
use parameters provided by the target cell for cell reselection.

The NAS can control the RAT(s) in which the cell selection should be
performed, for instance by indicating RAT(s) associated with the
selected PLMN, and by maintaining a list of forbidden registration
area(s) and a list of equivalent PLMNs. The UE shall select a suitable
cell based on RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE state measurements and cell
selection criteria.

In order to expedite the cell selection process, stored information for
several RATs, if available, may be used by the UE.

When camped on a cell, the UE shall regularly search for a better cell
according to the cell reselection criteria. If a better cell is found,
that cell is selected. The change of cell may imply a change of RAT.
Details on performance requirements for cell reselection can be found in
TS 38.133 \[8\].

The NAS is informed if the cell selection and reselection result in
changes in the received system information relevant for NAS.

For normal service, the UE shall camp on a suitable cell, monitor
control channel(s) of that cell so that the UE can:

\- receive system information from the PLMN; and

\- receive registration area information from the PLMN, e.g., tracking
area information; and

\- receive other AS and NAS Information; and

\- if registered:

\- receive paging and notification messages from the PLMN; and

\- initiate transfer to Connected mode.

For cell selection in multi-beam operations, measurement quantity of a
cell is up to UE implementation.

For cell reselection in multi-beam operations, including inter-RAT
reselection from E-UTRA to NR, the measurement quantity of this cell is
derived amongst the beams corresponding to the same cell based on
SS/PBCH block as follows:

> \- if *nrofSS-BlocksToAverage* (*maxRS-IndexCellQual* in E-UTRA) is
> not configured in *SIB2/SIB4* (*SIB24* in E-UTRA); or
>
> \- if *absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation* (*threshRS-Index* in E-UTRA)
> is not configured in *SIB2/SIB4* (*SIB24* in E-UTRA); or

\- if the highest beam measurement quantity value is below or equal to
*absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation* (*threshRS-Index* in E-UTRA):

\- derive a cell measurement quantity as the highest beam measurement
quantity value, where each beam measurement quantity is described in TS
38.215 \[11\].

> \- else:

\- derive a cell measurement quantity as the linear average of the power
values of up to *nrofSS-BlocksToAverage* (*maxRS-IndexCellQual* in
E-UTRA) of highest beam measurement quantity values above
*absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation* (*threshRS-Index* in E-UTRA).

###  5.2.2 States and state transitions in RRC\_IDLE state and RRC\_INACTIVE state

Figure 5.2.2-1 shows the states and state transitions and procedures in
RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE. Whenever a new PLMN selection is performed,
it causes an exit to number 1.

Figure 5.2.2-1 RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE Cell Selection and
Reselection

### 5.2.3 Cell Selection process

#### 5.2.3.1 Description

Cell selection is performed by one of the following two procedures:

a\) Initial cell selection (no prior knowledge of which RF channels are
NR frequencies):

1\. The UE shall scan all RF channels in the NR bands according to its
capabilities to find a suitable cell.

2\. On each frequency, the UE need only search for the strongest cell.

3\. Once a suitable cell is found, this cell shall be selected.

b\) Cell selection by leveraging stored information:

1\. This procedure requires stored information of frequencies and
optionally also information on cell parameters from previously received
measurement control information elements or from previously detected
cells.

2\. Once the UE has found a suitable cell, the UE shall select it.

3\. If no suitable cell is found, the initial cell selection procedure
in a) shall be started.

NOTE: Priorities between different frequencies or RATs provided to the
UE by system information or dedicated signalling are not used in the
cell selection process.

#### 5.2.3.2 Cell Selection Criterion

The signalled values Q~rxlevminoffset~ and Q~qualminoffset~ are only
applied when a cell is evaluated for cell selection as a result of a
periodic search for a higher priority PLMN while camped normally in a
VPLMN (TS 23.122 \[9\]). During this periodic search for higher priority
PLMN, the UE may check the S criteria of a cell using parameter values
stored from a different cell of this higher priority PLMN.

#### 5.2.3.3 E-UTRAN case in Cell Selection

The cell selection criteria and procedures in E-UTRAN are specified in
TS 36.304 \[7\].

### 5.2.4 Cell Reselection evaluation process

#### 5.2.4.1 Reselection priorities handling

Absolute priorities of different NR frequencies or inter-RAT frequencies
may be provided to the UE in the system information, in the *RRCRelease*
message, or by inheriting from another RAT at inter-RAT cell
(re)selection. In the case of system information, an NR frequency or
inter-RAT frequency may be listed without providing a priority (i.e. the
field *cellReselectionPriority* is absent for that frequency). If
priorities are provided in dedicated signalling, the UE shall ignore all
the priorities provided in system information. If UE is in *camped on
any cell* state, UE shall only apply the priorities provided by system
information from current cell, and the UE preserves priorities provided
by dedicated signalling and *deprioritisationReq* received in
*RRCRelease* unless specified otherwise. When the UE in camped normally
state, has only dedicated priorities other than for the current
frequency, the UE shall consider the current frequency to be the lowest
priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the network configured
values).

The UE shall only perform cell reselection evaluation for NR frequencies
and inter-RAT frequencies that are given in system information and for
which the UE has a priority provided.

In case UE receives *RRCRelease* with *deprioritisationReq*, UE shall
consider current frequency and stored frequencies due to the previously
received *RRCRelease* with *deprioritisationReq* or all the frequencies
of NR to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the
network configured values) while T325 is running irrespective of camped
RAT. The UE shall delete the stored deprioritisation request(s) when a
PLMN selection is performed on request by NAS (TS 23.122 \[9\]).

NOTE: UE should search for a higher priority layer for cell reselection
as soon as possible after the change of priority. The minimum related
performance requirements specified in TS 38.133 \[8\] are still
applicable.

The UE shall delete priorities provided by dedicated signalling when:

\- the UE enters a different RRC state; or

\- the optional validity time of dedicated priorities (T320) expires; or

\- the UE receives an *RRCRelease* message with the field
*cellReselectionPriorities* absent; or

\- a PLMN selection is performed on request by NAS (TS 23.122 \[9\]).

NOTE 2: Equal priorities between RATs are not supported.

The UE shall not consider any black listed cells as candidate for cell
reselection.

The UE in RRC\_IDLE state shall inherit the priorities provided by
dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time (i.e. T320 in NR
and E-UTRA), if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.

NOTE 3: The network may assign dedicated cell reselection priorities for
frequencies not configured by system information.

#### 5.2.4.2 Measurement rules for cell re-selection

Following rules are used by the UE to limit needed measurements:

\- If the serving cell fulfils Srxlev \> S~IntraSearchP~ and Squal \>
S~IntraSearchQ~, the UE may choose not to perform intra-frequency
measurements.

\- Otherwise, the UE shall perform intra-frequency measurements.

\- The UE shall apply the following rules for NR inter-frequencies and
inter-RAT frequencies which are indicated in system information and for
which the UE has priority provided as defined in 5.2.4.1:

\- For a NR inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequency with a reselection
priority higher than the reselection priority of the current NR
frequency, the UE shall perform measurements of higher priority NR
inter-frequency or inter-RAT frequencies according to TS 38.133 \[8\].

\- For a NR inter-frequency with an equal or lower reselection priority
than the reselection priority of the current NR frequency and for
inter-RAT frequency with lower reselection priority than the reselection
priority of the current NR frequency:

\- If the serving cell fulfils Srxlev \> S~nonIntraSearchP~ and Squal \>
S~nonIntraSearchQ~, the UE may choose not to perform measurements of NR
inter-frequencies or inter-RAT frequency cells of equal or lower
priority;

\- Otherwise, the UE shall perform measurements of NR inter-frequencies
or inter-RAT frequency cells of equal or lower priority according to TS
38.133 \[8\].

#### 5.2.4.3 Mobility states of a UE

##### 5.2.4.3.0 Introduction

The UE mobility state is determined if the parameters (T~CRmax~,
N~CR\_H~, N~CR\_M~ and T~CRmaxHyst~) are broadcasted in system
information for the serving cell.

**State detection criteria:**

Normal-mobility state criteria:

\- If number of cell reselections during time period T~CRmax~ is less
than N~CR\_M~.

Medium-mobility state criteria:

\- If number of cell reselections during time period T~CRmax~ is greater
than or equal to N~CR\_M~ but less than or equal to N~CR\_H~.

High-mobility state criteria:

\- If number of cell reselections during time period T~CRmax~ is greater
than N~CR\_H~.

The UE shall not consider consecutive reselections where a cell is
reselected again right after one reselection for mobility state
detection criteria.

**State transitions:**

The UE shall:

\- if the criteria for High-mobility state is detected:

\- enter High-mobility state.

\- else if the criteria for Medium-mobility state is detected:

\- enter Medium-mobility state.

\- else if criteria for either Medium- or High-mobility state is not
detected during time period T~CRmaxHys**t**~:

\- enter Normal-mobility state.

If the UE is in High- or Medium-mobility state, the UE shall apply the
speed dependent scaling rules as defined in clause 5.2.4.3.1.

##### 5.2.4.3.1 Scaling rules

UE shall apply the following scaling rules:

\- If neither Medium- nor High-mobility state is detected:

\- no scaling is applied.

\- If High-mobility state is detected:

\- Add the *sf-High* of \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Q~hyst~\" to
Q~hyst~ if broadcasted in system information;

\- For NR cells, multiply **Treselection~NR~** by the *sf-High* of
\"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Treselection~NR~\" if broadcasted in
system information;

\- For EUTRA cells, multiply **Treselection~EUTRA~** by the *sf-High* of
\"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Treselection~EUTRA~\" if broadcasted
in system information.

\- If Medium-mobility state is detected:

\- Add the *sf-Medium* of \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Q~hyst~\"
to Q~hyst~ if broadcasted in system information;

\- For NR cells, multiply **Treselection~NR~** by the *sf-Medium* of
\"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Treselection~NR~\" if broadcasted in
system information;

\- For EUTRA cells, multiply **Treselection~EUTRA~** by the *sf-Medium*
of \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Treselection~EUTRA~\" if
broadcasted in system information.

In case scaling is applied to any **Treselection~RAT~** parameter, the
UE shall round up the result after all scalings to the nearest second.

#### 5.2.4.4 Cells with cell reservations, access restrictions or unsuitable for normal camping

For the highest ranked cell (including serving cell) according to cell
reselection criteria specified in clause 5.2.4.6, for the best cell
according to absolute priority reselection criteria specified in clause
5.2.4.5, the UE shall check if the access is restricted according to the
rules in clause 5.3.1.

If that cell and other cells have to be excluded from the candidate
list, as stated in clause 5.3.1, the UE shall not consider these as
candidates for cell reselection. This limitation shall be removed when
the highest ranked cell changes.

If the highest ranked cell or best cell according to absolute priority
reselection rules is an intra-frequency or inter-frequency cell which is
not suitable due to being part of the \"list of 5GS forbidden TAs for
roaming\" or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being
equivalent to the registered PLMN, the UE shall not consider this cell
and other cells on the same frequency, as candidates for reselection for
a maximum of 300 seconds. If the UE enters into state *any cell
selection*, any limitation shall be removed. If the UE is redirected
under NR control to a frequency for which the timer is running, any
limitation on that frequency shall be removed.

If the highest ranked cell or best cell according to absolute priority
reselection rules is an inter-RAT cell which is not suitable due to
being part of the \"list of forbidden TAs for roaming\" or belonging to
a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered
PLMN, the UE shall not consider this cell and other cells on the same
frequency, as candidates for reselection for a maximum of 300 seconds.
If the UE enters into state *any cell selection*, any limitation shall
be removed. If the UE is redirected under NR control to a frequency for
which the timer is running, any limitation on that frequency shall be
removed.

#### 5.2.4.5 NR Inter-frequency and inter-RAT Cell Reselection criteria

If ***threshServingLowQ*** is broadcast in system information and more
than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving
cell, cell reselection to a cell on a higher priority NR frequency or
inter-RAT frequency than the serving frequency shall be performed if:

\- A cell of a higher priority NR or EUTRAN RAT/frequency fulfils Squal
\> Thresh~X,\ HighQ~ during a time interval Treselection~RAT~

Otherwise, cell reselection to a cell on a higher priority NR frequency
or inter-RAT frequency than the serving frequency shall be performed if:

\- A cell of a higher priority RAT/ frequency fulfils Srxlev \>
Thresh~X,\ HighP~ during a time interval Treselection~RAT~; and

\- More than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current
serving cell.

Cell reselection to a cell on an equal priority NR frequency shall be
based on ranking for intra-frequency cell reselection as defined in
clause 5.2.4.6.

If ***threshServingLowQ*** is broadcast in system information and more
than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving
cell, cell reselection to a cell on a lower priority NR frequency or
inter-RAT frequency than the serving frequency shall be performed if:

\- The serving cell fulfils Squal \< Thresh~Serving,\ LowQ~ and a cell
of a lower priority NR or E-UTRAN RAT/ frequency fulfils Squal \>
Thresh~X,\ LowQ~ during a time interval Treselection~RAT~.

Otherwise, cell reselection to a cell on a lower priority NR frequency
or inter-RAT frequency than the serving frequency shall be performed if:

\- The serving cell fulfils Srxlev \< Thresh~Serving,\ LowP~ and a cell
of a lower priority RAT/ frequency fulfils Srxlev \> Thresh~X,\ LowP~
during a time interval Treselection~RAT~; and

> \- More than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current
> serving cell.

Cell reselection to a higher priority RAT/frequency shall take
precedence over a lower priority RAT/frequency if multiple cells of
different priorities fulfil the cell reselection criteria.

If more than one cell meets the above criteria, the UE shall reselect a
cell as follows:

\- If the highest-priority frequency is an NR frequency, the highest
ranked cell among the cells on the highest priority frequency(ies)
meeting the criteria according to clause 5.2.4.6;

\- If the highest-priority frequency is from another RAT, the strongest
cell among the cells on the highest priority frequency(ies) meeting the
criteria of that RAT.

#### 5.2.4.6 Intra-frequency and equal priority inter-frequency Cell Reselection criteria

The cell-ranking criterion R~s~ for serving cell and R~n~ for
neighbouring cells is defined by:

+-------------------------------------------+
| R~s~ = Q~meas,s~ +Q~hyst~ - Qoffset~temp~ |
|                                           |
| R~n~ = Q~meas,n~ -Qoffset - Qoffset~temp~ |
+-------------------------------------------+

where:

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Q~meas~       | RSRP measurement quantity used in cell              |
|               | reselections.                                       |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Qoffset       | For intra-frequency: Equals to Qoffset~s,n~, if     |
|               | Qoffset~s,n~ is valid, otherwise this equals to     |
|               | zero.                                               |
|               |                                                     |
|               | For inter-frequency: Equals to Qoffset~s,n~ plus    |
|               | Qoffset~frequency~, if Qoffset~s,n~ is valid,       |
|               | otherwise this equals to Qoffset~frequency~.        |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Qoffset~temp~ | Offset temporarily applied to a cell as specified   |
|               | in TS 38.331 \[3\].                                 |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

The UE shall perform ranking of all cells that fulfil the cell selection
criterion S, which is defined in 5.2.3.2.

The cells shall be ranked according to the R criteria specified above by
deriving Q~meas,n~ and Q~meas,s~ and calculating the R values using
averaged RSRP results.

If *rangeToBestCell* is not configured, the UE shall perform cell
reselection to the highest ranked cell. If this cell is found to be
not-suitable, the UE shall behave according to clause 5.2.4.4.

If *rangeToBestCell* is configured*,* then the UE shall perform cell
reselection to the cell with the highest number of beams above the
threshold (i.e. *absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation*) among the cells whose
R value is within *rangeToBestCell* of the R value of the highest ranked
cell. If there are multiple such cells, the UE shall perform cell
reselection to the highest ranked cell among them. If this cell is found
to be not-suitable, the UE shall behave according to clause 5.2.4.4.

In all cases, the UE shall reselect the new cell, only if the following
conditions are met:

\- the new cell is better than the serving cell according to the cell
reselection criteria specified above during a time interval
Treselection~RAT~;

\- more than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current
serving cell.

NOTE: If *rangeToBestCell* is configured but
*absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation* is not configured on an NR frequency,
the UE considers that there is one beam above the threshold for each
cell on that frequency.

High-mobility state and *sf-Medium* for Medium-mobility state.

#### 5.2.4.8 Inter-RAT Cell reselection in RRC\_INACTIVE state

For UE in the RRC\_INACTIVE state, upon cell reselection to another RAT,
UE transitions from RRC\_INACTIVE to RRC\_IDLE and performs­ actions as
specified in TS 38.331 \[3\].

### 5.2.5 Camped Normally state

This state is applicable for RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE state.

When camped normally, the UE shall perform the following tasks:

\- monitor the paging channel of the cell as specified in clause 7
according to information broadcast in *SIB1*;

\- monitor Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI as specified
in clause 6.5 in TS 38.331 \[3\];

\- monitor relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\];

\- perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure;

\- execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following
occasions/triggers:

1\) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in TS
38.133 \[8\];

2\) When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection
evaluation procedure has been modified.

### 5.2.6 Selection of cell at transition to RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE state

At reception of *RRCRelease* message to transition the UE to RRC\_IDLE
or RRC\_INACTIVE, UE shall attempt to camp on a suitable cell according
to *redirectedCarrierInfo* if included in the *RRCRelease* message. If
the UE cannot find a suitable cell, the UE is allowed to camp on any
suitable cell of the indicated RAT. If the *RRCRelease* message does not
contain the *redirectedCarrierInfo,* UE shall attempt to select a
suitable cell on an NR carrier. If no suitable cell is found according
to the above, the UE shall perform cell selection using stored
information in order to find a suitable cell to camp on.

When returning to RRC\_IDLE state after UE moved to RRC\_CONNECTED state
from *camped on any cell* state, UE shall attempt to camp on an
acceptable cell according to *redirectedCarrierInfo*, if included in the
*RRCRelease* message. If the UE cannot find an acceptable cell, the UE
is allowed to camp on any acceptable cell of the indicated RAT. If the
*RRCRelease* message does not contain *redirectedCarrierInfo* UE shall
attempt to select an acceptable cell on an NR frequency. If no
acceptable cell is found according to the above, the UE shall continue
to search for an acceptable cell of any PLMN in state *any cell
selection*.

### 5.2.7 Any Cell Selection state

This state is applicable for RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE state. In this
state, the UE shall perform cell selection process to find a suitable
cell. If the cell selection process fails to find a suitable cell after
a complete scan of all RATs and all frequency bands supported by the UE,
the UE shall attempt to find an acceptable cell of any PLMN to camp on,
trying all RATs that are supported by the UE and searching first for a
high-quality cell, as defined in clause 5.1.1.2.

The UE, which is not camped on any cell, shall stay in this state.

### 5.2.8 Camped on Any Cell state

This state is only applicable for RRC\_IDLE state. In this state, the UE
shall perform the following tasks:

\- monitor Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI as specified
in clause 6.5 in TS 38.331 \[3\];

\- monitor relevant System Information as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\];

\- perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure;

\- execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following
occasions/triggers:

1\) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in TS
38.133 \[8\];

2\) When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection
evaluation procedure has been modified.

\- regularly attempt to find a suitable cell trying all frequencies of
all RATs that are supported by the UE. If a suitable cell is found, UE
shall move to *camped normally* state.

\- if the UE supports voice services and the current cell does not
support IMS emergency calls as indicated by the field
*ims-EmergencySupport* in SIB1 as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\], the UE
shall perform cell selection/reselection to an acceptable cell that
supports emergency calls in any supported RAT regardless of priorities
provided in system information from current cell, if no suitable cell is
found.

5.3 Cell Reservations and Access Restrictions
---------------------------------------------

### 5.3.0 Introduction

There are two mechanisms which allow an operator to impose cell
reservations or access restrictions. The first mechanism uses indication
of cell status and special reservations for control of cell selection
and reselection procedures. The second mechanism, referred to as Unified
Access Control as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\], shall allow preventing
selected access categories or access identities from sending initial
access messages for load control reasons.

### 5.3.1 Cell status and cell reservations

Cell status and cell reservations are indicated in the *MIB or SIB1*
message as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\] by means of three fields:

\- ***cellBarred*** (IE type: \"barred\" or \"not barred\")\
Indicated in *MIB* message. In case of multiple PLMNs indicated in
*SIB1*, this field is common for all PLMNs

\- ***cellReservedForOperatorUse*** (IE type: \"reserved\" or \"not
reserved\")\
Indicated in *SIB1* message*.* In case of multiple PLMNs indicated in
*SIB1*, this field is specified per PLMN.

\- ***cellReservedForOtherUse*** (IE type: \"true\")\
Indicated in *SIB1* message. In case of multiple PLMNs indicated in
*SIB1*, this field is common for all PLMNs.

When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\" and \"not reserved\" for
operator use and not \"true\" for other use,

\- All UEs shall treat this cell as candidate during the cell selection
and cell reselection procedures.

When cell status is indicated as \"true\" for other use,

\- The UE ***shall treat this cell as if cell status is \"barred\"***.

When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\" and \"reserved\" for
operator use for any PLMN and not \"true\" for other use,

\- UEs assigned to Access Identity 11 or 15 operating in their
HPLMN/EHPLMN shall treat this cell as candidate during the cell
selection and reselection procedures if the field
***cellReservedForOperatorUse for that PLMN set to \"reserved\".***

***- UEs assigned to an*** Access Identity ***0, 1, 2 and 12 to 14 shall
behave as if the cell status is \"barred\" in case the cell is
\"reserved for operator use\" for the registered PLMN or the selected
PLMN.***

NOTE 1: Access Identities 11, 15 are only valid for use in the HPLMN/
EHPLMN; Access Identities 12, 13, 14 are only valid for use in the home
country as specified in TS 22.261 \[12\].

When cell status \"barred\" is indicated or to be treated as if the cell
status is \"barred\",

\- The UE is not permitted to select/reselect this cell, not even for
emergency calls.

\- The UE shall select another cell according to the following rule:

\- If the cell is to be treated as if the cell status is \"barred\" due
to being unable to acquire the *MIB*:

\- the UE may exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell
selection/reselection for up to 300 seconds.

\- the UE may select another cell on the same frequency if the selection
criteria are fulfilled.

\- else:

\- If the field *intraFreqReselection* in *MIB* message is set to
\"allowed\":

\- the UE may select another cell on the same frequency if re-selection
criteria are fulfilled;

\- If the cell is to be treated as if the cell status is \"barred\" due
to being unable to acquire the *SIB1*:

\- the UE may exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell
selection/reselection for up to 300 seconds;

\- else:

\- the UE shall exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell
selection/reselection for 300 seconds.

\- If the field *intraFreqReselection* in *MIB* message is set to \"not
allowed\":

\- If the cell is to be treated as if the cell status is \"barred\" due
to being unable to acquire the *SIB1*:

\- the UE may exclude the barred cell as a candidate for cell
selection/reselection for up to 300 seconds;

\- the UE shall not re-select to another cell on the same frequency as
the barred cell and exclude such cell(s) as candidate(s) for cell
selection/reselection for 300 seconds;

\- else:

\- the UE shall exclude the barred cell and the cells on the same
frequency as a candidate for cell selection/reselection for 300 seconds.

NOTE 2: If barring of a cell is triggered by the condition of
*trackingAreaCode* not being provided, as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\],
the barring only applies to this PLMN and the UE can re-evaluate the
barring condition again due to selection of another PLMN*.*

The cell selection of another cell may also include a change of RAT.

### 5.3.2 Unified access control

The information on cell access restrictions associated with Access
Categories and Identities is broadcast in *SIB1* as part of Unified
Access Control as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\].

The UE shall ignore Access Category and Identity related cell access
restrictions for cell reselection. A change of the indicated access
restriction shall not trigger cell reselection by the UE.

The UE shall consider Access Category and Identity related cell access
restrictions for NAS initiated access attempts and RNAU as specified in
TS 38.331 \[3\].

5.4 Tracking Area registration
------------------------------

In the UE, the AS shall report tracking area information to the NAS.

If the UE reads more than one PLMN identity in the current cell, the UE
shall report the found PLMN identities that make the cell suitable in
the tracking area information to NAS.

The NAS part of the location registration process is specified in TS
23.122 \[9\].

5.5 RAN Area registration
-------------------------

The UE performs a RAN-based notification area update (RNAU) periodically
or when the UE selects a cell that does not belong to the configured
RNA.

6 Reception of broadcast information
====================================

6.1 Reception of system information
-----------------------------------

The NAS is informed if the cell selection and reselection results in
changes in the received NAS system information.

The UE shall monitor the Paging Occasions (POs) as described in chapter
7.1 to receive System Information change notifications in RRC\_IDLE and
RRC\_INACTIVE. The changes in the system information are notified by the
network using a Short Message as specified in TS 38.331 \[3\]. When the
Short Message notifies system information changes, then the UE shall
acquire or re-acquire the concerned system information as specified in
TS 38.331 \[3\].

7 Paging
========

7.1 Discontinuous Reception for paging
--------------------------------------

The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in RRC\_IDLE and
RRC\_INACTIVE state in order to reduce power consumption. The UE
monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle. A PO is a set of PDCCH
monitoring occasions and can consist of multiple time slots (e.g.
subframe or OFDM symbol) where paging DCI can be sent (TS 38.213 \[4\]).
One Paging Frame (PF) is one Radio Frame and may contain one or multiple
PO(s) or starting point of a PO.

In multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the same paging message
and the same Short Message are repeated in all transmitted beams and
thus the selection of the beam(s) for the reception of the paging
message and Short Message is up to UE implementation. The paging message
is same for both RAN initiated paging and CN initiated paging.

The UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN
initiated paging. If the UE receives a CN initiated paging in
RRC\_INACTIVE state, the UE moves to RRC\_IDLE and informs NAS.

The PF and PO for paging are determined by the following formulae:

SFN for the PF is determined by:

(SFN + PF\_offset) mod T = (T div N)\*(UE\_ID mod N)

Index (i\_s), indicating the index of the PO is determined by:

i\_s = floor (UE\_ID/N) mod Ns

The PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are determined according to
*pagingSearchSpace* as specified in TS 38.213 \[4\] and
*firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* if configured as specified in TS
38.331 \[3\]. When *SearchSpaceId* = 0 is configured for
*pagingSearchSpace*, the PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are same
as for RMSI as defined in clause 13 in TS 38.213 \[4\].

When *SearchSpaceId* = 0 is configured for *pagingSearchSpace***, Ns is
either 1 or 2. For Ns = 1, there is only one PO which starts from the
first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the PF. For Ns = 2, PO is
either in the first half frame (i\_s = 0) or the second half frame (i\_s
= 1) of the PF.**

When *SearchSpaceId* other than 0 is configured for *pagingSearchSpace,*
the UE monitors the (i\_s + 1)^th^ PO. A PO is a set of \'S\'
consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions where \'S\' is the number of
actual transmitted SSBs determined according to *ssb-PositionsInBurst*
in *SIB1*. The K^th^ PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the PO
corresponds to the K^th^ transmitted SSB. The PDCCH monitoring occasions
for paging which do not overlap with UL symbols (determined according to
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*) are sequentially numbered from zero
starting from the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the PF.
When *firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* is present, the starting PDCCH
monitoring occasion number of (i\_s + 1)^th^ PO is the (i\_s + 1)^th^
value of the *firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* parameter; otherwise,
it is equal to i\_s \* S.

NOTE 1: A PO associated with a PF may start in the PF or after the PF.

NOTE 2: The PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span multiple radio
frames. When *SearchSpaceId* other than 0 is configured for
*paging-SearchSpace* the PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span
multiple periods of the paging search space.

The following parameters are used for the calculation of PF and i\_s
above:

**T: DRX cycle of the UE (**T is determined by the shortest of the UE
specific DRX value(s), if configured by RRC and/or upper layers, and a
default DRX value broadcast in system information. In RRC\_IDLE state,
if UE specific DRX is not configured by upper layers, the default value
is applied).

**N: number of total paging frames in T**

Ns: number of paging **occasions** for a PF

PF\_offset: offset used for PF determination

**UE\_ID: 5G-S-TMSI mod 1024**

Parameters *Ns*, *nAndPagingFrameOffset*, and the length of default DRX
Cycle are signaled in *SIB1*. The values of N and PF\_offset are derived
from the parameter *nAndPagingFrameOffset* as defined in TS 38.331
\[3\]. The parameter *first-PDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* is signalled
in *SIB1* for paging in initial DL BWP. For paging in a DL BWP other
than the initial DL BWP, the parameter
*first-PDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* is signaled in the corresponding
BWP configuration.

If the UE has no 5G-S-TMSI, for instance when the UE has not yet
registered onto the network, the UE shall use as default identity UE\_ID
= 0 in the PF and i\_s formulas above.

5G-S-TMSI is a 48 bit long bit string as defined in TS 23.501 \[10\].
5G-S-TMSI shall in the formulae above be interpreted as a binary number
where the left most bit represents the most significant bit.
