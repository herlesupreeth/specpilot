Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

**The basic multiple access scheme for NR is orthogonal for both
downlink and uplink data transmissions, e.g., time and frequency
physical resources of different users are not overlapped. On the other
hand, non-orthogonal multiple-access schemes recently gained wide
interest.**

**Non-orthogonal transmission can be applied to both grant-based and
grant-free transmission. The benefits of non-orthogonal multiple access,
particularly when enabling grant-free transmission, may encompass a
variety of use cases or deployment scenarios, including eMBB, URLLC,
mMTC etc. In RRC\_CONNECTED state, it saves the scheduling request
procedure assuming UE is already uplink synchronized. In RRC\_INACTIVE
state, data can be transmitted even without RACH procedure or with
2-step RACH. The saving of the signalling naturally also saves UE\'s
power consumption, reduces latency and increases system capacity.**

1 Scope
=======

This document is intended to gather all technical outcome of the study
item \"Study on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for NR\" \[1\],
and draw a conclusion on a way forward.

This activity involves the Radio Access work area of the 3GPP studies
and has impacts both on the Mobile Equipment and Access Network of the
3GPP systems.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.
