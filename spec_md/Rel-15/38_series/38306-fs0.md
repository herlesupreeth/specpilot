4.1 Supported max data rate
---------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The DL and UL max data rate supported by the UE is calculated by band or
band combinations supported by the UE. A UE supporting NR (NR SA, MR-DC)
shall support the calculated DL and UL max data rate defined in 4.1.2.

### 4.1.2 Supported max data rate

For NR, the approximate data rate for a given number of aggregated
carriers in a band or band combination is computed as follows.

wherein

J is the number of aggregated component carriers in a band or band
combination

R~max~ = 948/1024

For the j-th CC,

![](./media/image4.wmf){width="0.3333333333333333in" height="0.28125in"}
is the maximum number of supported layers given by
*maxNumberMIMO-LayersPDSCH* for downlink and maximum of
*maxNumberMIMO-LayersCB-PUSCH* and *maxNumberMIMO-LayersNonCB-PUSCH* for
uplink.

is the maximum supported modulation order given by
*supportedModulationOrderDL* for downlink and
*supportedModulationOrderUL* for uplink.

is the scaling factor given by *scalingFactor* and can take the values
1, 0.8, 0.75, and 0.4.

is the numerology (as defined in TS 38.211 \[6\])

is the average OFDM symbol duration in a subframe for numerology , i.e.
. Note that normal cyclic prefix is assumed.

is the maximum RB allocation in bandwidth with numerology , as defined
in 5.3 TS 38.101-1 \[2\] and 5.3 TS 38.101-2 \[3\], where is the UE
supported maximum bandwidth in the given band or band combination.

is the overhead and takes the following values

> 0.14, for frequency range FR1 for DL
>
> 0.18, for frequency range FR2 for DL
>
> 0.08, for frequency range FR1 for UL
>
> 0.10, for frequency range FR2 for UL

NOTE: Only one of the UL or SUL carriers (the one with the higher data
rate) is counted for a cell operating SUL.

The approximate maximum data rate can be computed as the maximum of the
approximate data rates computed using the above formula for each of the
supported band or band combinations.

For single carrier NR SA operation, the UE shall support a data rate for
the carrier that is no smaller than the data rate computed using the
above formula, with $J = 1\ CC$ and component
$v_{\text{Layers}}^{(j)} \cdot Q_{m}^{\left( j \right)} \cdot f_{}^{\left( j \right)}$
is no smaller than 4.

NOTE: As an example, the value 4 in the component above can correspond
to $v_{\text{Layers}}^{(j)} = 1$, $Q_{m}^{\left( j \right)} = \ 4$ and
$f_{}^{\left( j \right)} = 1$.

For EUTRA in case of MR-DC, the approximate data rate for a given number
of aggregated carriers in a band or band combination is computed as
follows.

> Data rate (in Mbps) =
> $10^{- 3}*\sum_{j = 1}^{J}{\text{TB}S_{\text{j~\ }}}$

wherein

J is the number of aggregated EUTRA component carriers in MR-DC band
combination

> $\text{TB}S_{\text{j\ }}$is the total maximum number of DL-SCH
> transport block bits received or the total maximum number of UL-SCH
> transport block bits transmitted, within a 1ms TTI for j-th CC, as
> derived from TS36.213 \[19\] based on the UE supported maximum MIMO
> layers for the j-th CC, and based on the maximum modulation order for
> the j-th CC and number of PRBs based on the bandwidth of the j-th CC
> according to indicated UE capabilities.

The approximate maximum data rate can be computed as the maximum of the
approximate data rates computed using the above formula for each of the
supported band or band combinations.

For MR-DC, the approximate maximum data rate is computed as the sum of
the approximate maximum data rates from NR and EUTRA.

### 4.1.3 Void

### 4.1.4 Total layer 2 buffer size

The total layer 2 buffer size is defined as the sum of the number of
bytes that the UE is capable of storing in the RLC transmission windows
and RLC reception and reassembly windows and also in PDCP reordering
windows for all radio bearers.

The required total layer 2 buffer size in MR-DC is the maximum value of
the calculated values based on the following equations:

\- *MaxULDataRate\_MN* \* *RLCRTT\_MN* + *MaxULDataRate\_SN* \*
*RLCRTT\_SN* + *MaxDLDataRate\_SN* \* *RLCRTT\_SN* + *MaxDLDataRate\_MN*
*\** (*RLCRTT\_SN* + *X2/Xn delay* + *Queuing in SN*)

\- *MaxULDataRate\_MN* \* *RLCRTT\_MN* + *MaxULDataRate\_SN* \*
*RLCRTT\_SN* + *MaxDLDataRate\_MN* \* *RLCRTT\_MN* + *MaxDLDataRate\_SN*
*\** (*RLCRTT\_MN* + *X2/Xn delay* + *Queuing in MN*)

Otherwise it is calculated by *MaxDLDataRate \* RLC RTT + MaxULDataRate
\* RLC RTT*.

NOTE: Additional L2 buffer required for preprocessing of data is not
taken into account in above formula.

The required total layer 2 buffer size is determined as the maximum
total layer 2 buffer size of all the calculated ones for each band
combination and the applicable Feature Set combination in the supported
MR-DC or NR band combinations. The RLC RTT for NR cell group corresponds
to the smallest SCS numerology supported in the band combination and the
applicable Feature Set combination.

wherein

> X2/Xn delay + Queuing in SN = 25ms if SCG is NR, and 55ms if SCG is
> EUTRA
>
> X2/Xn delay + Queuing in MN = 25ms if MCG is NR, and 55ms if MCG is
> EUTRA
>
> RLC RTT for EUTRA cell group = 75ms
>
> RLC RTT for NR cell group is defined in Table 4.1.4-1

Table 4.1.4-1: RLC RTT for NR cell group per SCS

  SCS (KHz)      RLC RTT (ms)

4.2 UE Capability Parameters
----------------------------

### 4.2.1 Introduction

The following clauses define the UE radio access capability parameters.
Only parameters for which there is the possibility for UEs to signal
different values are considered as UE radio access capability
parameters. Therefore, mandatory features without capability parameters
that are the same for all UEs are not listed here.

The network needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability
parameters when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.

The UE may support different functionalities between FDD and TDD, and/or
between FR1 and FR2. The UE shall indicate the UE capabilities as
follows. In the table of UE capability parameter in subsequent clauses,
\"Yes\" in the column by \"FDD-TDD DIFF\" and \"FR1-FR2 DIFF\" indicates
the UE capability field can have a different value for between FDD and
TDD or between FR1 and FR2 and \"No\" indicates if it cannot. Regarding
to the per UE capabilities that are FDD/TDD differentiated (i.e.
capabilities indicated as \"Yes\" in the column by \"FDD-TDD DIFF\"),
the corresponding capabilities indicated by the FDD capability is
applied to SUL/SDL if SUL/SDL band is supported by the UE. \"FD\" in the
column indicates to refer the associated field description. \"FR1 only\"
or \"FR2 only\" in the column indicates the associated feature is only
supported in FR1 or FR2 and \"TDD only\" indicates the associated
feature is only supported in TDD and not applicable to SUL/SDL carriers.
\"N/A\" in the column indicates it is not applicable to the feature
(e,g. the signalling supports the UE to have different values between
FDD and TDD or between FR1 and FR2).

1\> set all fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability except
fdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities, tdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities,
fr1-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and fr2-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities, to
include the values applicable for all duplex mode(s) and frequency
range(s) that the UE supports;

1\> if UE supports both FDD (or SUL/SDL) and TDD and if (some of) the UE
capability fields have a different value for FDD (or SUL/SDL) and TDD:

2\> if for FDD (and, if the UE supports SUL/SDL, for SUL/SDL), the UE
supports additional functionality compared to what is indicated by the
previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:

3\> include field fdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include
fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FDD;

2\> if for TDD, the UE supports additional functionality compared to
what is indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:

3\> include field tdd-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include
fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for TDD;

1\> if UE supports both FR1 and FR2 and if (some of) the UE capability
fields have a different value for FR1 and FR2:

2\> if for FR1, the UE supports additional functionality compared to
what is indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:

3\> include field fr1-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include
fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FR1;

2\> if for FR2, the UE supports additional functionality compared to
what is indicated by the previous fields of UE-NR/MRDC-Capability:

3\> include field fr2-Add-UE-NR/MRDC-Capabilities and set it to include
fields reflecting the additional functionality applicable for FR2;

NOTE 1: The fields which indicate \"shall be set to 1\" or \"shall be
set to *supported*\" in the following tables means these features are
purely mandatory and are assumed they are the same as mandatory without
capability signalling.

NOTE 2: For the case where the UE is allowed to support different
functionality between FDD and TDD and between FR1 and FR2 according to
the specification, the UE capability indication is clarified in Annex B.

For optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter
indicates whether the feature has been implemented and successfully
tested. For mandatory features with the UE radio access capability
parameter, the parameter indicates whether the feature has been
successfully tested. In the table of UE capability parameter in
subsequent clauses, \"Yes\" in the column by \"M\" indicates the
associated feature is mandatory and \"No\" indicates the associated
feature is optional. \"CY\" in the column indicates the associated
feature is conditional mandatory and the condition is described in the
field description and the associated feature is considered mandatory
with capability parameter, when the described condition is satisfied.
\"FD\" in the column indicates to refer the associated field
description. Some parameters in subsequent clauses are not related to UE
features and in the case, \"N/A\" is indicated in the column.

UE capability parameters have hierarchical structure. In the table of UE
capability parameter in subsequent clauses, \"Per\" indicates the level
the associated parameter is included. \"UE\" in the column indicates the
associated parameter is signalled per UE, \"Band\" indicates it is
signalled per band, \"BC\" indicates it is signalled per band
combination, \"FS\" indicates it is signalled per feature set (per band
per band combination), \"FSPC\" indicates it is signalled per feature
set per component carrier (per CC per band per band combination), and
\"FD\" in the column indicates to refer the associated field
description.

########  Annex A (normative): Differentiation of capabilities

A.1: TDD/FDD differentiation of capabilities in TDD-FDD CA
==========================================================

Annex A.1 specifies for which TDD and FDD serving cells a UE supporting
TDD/FDD CA shall support a feature/capability for which it indicates
support within the capability signalling.

A UE that indicates support for TDD/FDD CA (e.g. MCG or SCG):

\- For the fields for which the UE is allowed to indicate different
support for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature on the PCell
and/or SCell(s), as specified in tables A.1-1 in accordance to the
following rules:

\- PCell: the UE shall support the feature for the PCell, if the UE
indicates support of the feature for the PCell duplex mode;

\- PSCell: the UE shall support the feature for the PSCell, if the UE
indicates support of the feature for the PSCell duplex mode;

\- Per serving cell: the UE shall support the feature for a serving cell
if the UE indicates support of the feature for the serving cell\'s
duplex mode;

\- All serving cells: UE shall support the feature for all serving cells
in a CG if the UE indicates support of the feature for both TDD and FDD
duplex modes;

\- Associated serving cells: UE shall support the feature if the UE
indicates support of the feature for all associated serving cells\'s
duplex modes;

\- For the fields where the UE is not allowed to indicate different
support for FDD and TDD, the UE shall support the feature for PCell and
SCell(s) if the UE indicates support of the feature via the common
capability bit.

A.5: General differentiation of capabilities in Cross-Carrier operation
=======================================================================

Annex A.5 specifies for which multiple serving cells a UE supporting
cross-carrier operation shall support a feature/capability for which it
indicates support within the capability signalling.

A UE that indicates support for cross-carrier operation in CA (e.g. MCG
or SCG):

\- For the fields for which the UE is allowed to indicate different
support for different bands, the UE shall support the feature on the
PCell and/or SCell(s) in cross-carrier operation, as specified in tables
A.5-1 in accordance to the following rules:

\- Triggered serving cell: the UE shall support the feature if the UE
indicates support of the feature for the band of the
scheduled/triggered/indicated serving cell;

\- Triggering&Triggered serving cells: UE shall support the feature if
the UE indicates support of the feature for the band of both the
scheduling/triggering/indicating serving cell and the
scheduled/triggered/indicated serving cell;

######## Annex B (informative): UE capability indication for UE capabilities with both FDD/TDD and FR1/FR2 differentiations

Annex B clarifies the UE capability indication for the case where the UE
is allowed to support different functionality between FDD and TDD, and
between FR1 and FR2. Table B-1 clarifies the setting of UE capability
fields for cases where the UE supports the corresponding feature in
different combinations of duplex mode and frequency range. There are two
possible ways of UE capability indication in Case 3 and Case 8.
