3.4 Test tolerances
-------------------

The requirements given in the present document make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 38.533 \[5\] defines the
test tolerances.

3.5 Frequency bands grouping
----------------------------

### 3.5.1 Introduction

The intention with the frequency band grouping below is to increase the
readability of the specification.

The frequency bands grouping is derived based on UE REFSENS requirements
specified in \[18, 19, 20\] and assuming 0.5 dB step between the
neighbour groups. The groups are defined in the order of increasing
REFSENS, i.e., the group A has the smallest REFSENS among the groups.
For the same SCS and a given bandwidth, the bands within the same group
have the same Io conditions in a corresponding requirement in this
specification, provided the bands support this SCS. For different SCSs
supported by a frequency band and the same bandwidth, different Io
conditions may apply for the frequency band in the requirements, while
the band group is the same, based on the lowest REFSENS requirement
normalized by the number of subcarriers among its supported SCSs for
this bandwidth. For the same SCS but different supported bandwidths, the
group for a band is determined based on the lowest REFSENS requirement
normalized by the number of subcarriers among its supported bandwidths.

### 3.5.2 NR operating bands in FR1

NR frequency bands grouping for FR1 is specified in Table 3.5.2-1.

All the requirements in this specification applicable for EN-DC are also
applicable for NGEN-DC.

### 3.6.7 Applicability of QCL

For the requirements specified in this version of the specification, a
reference signal is considered to be QCLed to another reference signal
if it is in the same TCI chain as the other reference signal, provided
that the number of Reference Signals in the chain is no more than 4. It
is assumed there is single QCL type per TCI chain.

A TCI chain consists of an SSB, and one or more CSI-RS resources, and
the TCI state of each Reference Signal includes another Reference Signal
in the same TCI chain.

DMRS of PDCCH or PDSCH is QCLed with the reference signal in its active
TCI state and any other reference signal that is QCLed, based on above
criteria, with the reference signal in the active TCI state.

4 SA: RRC\_IDLE state mobility
==============================

4.1 Cell Selection
------------------

After a UE has switched on and a PLMN has been selected, the cell
selection process takes place, as described in TS 38.304 \[1\]. This
process allows the UE to select a suitable cell where to camp on in
order to access available services. In this process, the UE can use
stored information (*Stored information cell selection*) or not
(*Initial cell selection*).

4.2 Cell Re-selection
---------------------

### 4.2.1 Introduction

The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable
cell and camp on it.

When the UE is in either *Camped* *Normally* state or *Camped on Any
Cell* state on a cell, the UE shall attempt to detect, synchronise, and
monitor intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated
by the serving cell. For intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells the
serving cell may not provide explicit neighbour list but carrier
frequency information and bandwidth information only. UE measurement
activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in TS 38.304
\[1\], allowing the UE to limit its measurement activity.

In the requirements of clause 4.2, the exceptions for side conditions
apply as follows:

\- for the UE capable of CA, the applicable exceptions for side
conditions are specified in Annex B, clause B.3.2.1, B.3.2.3, or B.3.2.5
for UE supporting CA in FR1, CA in FR2 and CA between FR1 and FR2,
respectively;

\- for the UE capable of SUL, the applicable exceptions for side
conditions are specified in Annex B, clause B.3.4.1 for UE supporting
SUL in FR1.

### 4.2.2 Requirements

#### 4.2.2.1 UE measurement capability

For idle mode cell re-selection purposes, the UE shall be capable of
monitoring at least:

\- Intra-frequency carrier, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 7 NR inter-frequency carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 7 FDD E-UTRA inter-RAT carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 7 TDD E-UTRA inter-RAT carriers.

*In addition to the requirements defined above,* a UE supporting E-UTRA
measurements in RRC\_IDLE state shall be capable of monitoring a total
of at least 14 carrier frequency layers, which includes serving layer,
comprising of any above defined combination of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD
and NR layers.

#### 4.2.2.2 Measurement and evaluation of serving cell

The UE shall measure the SS-RSRP and SS-RSRQ level of the serving cell
and evaluate the cell selection criterion S defined in TS 38.304 \[1\]
for the serving cell at least once every M1\*N1 DRX cycle; where:

> M1=2 if SMTC periodicity (T~SMTC~) \> 20 ms and DRX cycle ≤ 0.64
> second,
>
> otherwise M1=1.

The UE shall filter the SS-RSRP and SS-RSRQ measurements of the serving
cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used
for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by, at
least DRX cycle/2.

If the UE has evaluated according to Table 4.2.2.2-1 in N~serv~
consecutive DRX cycles that the serving cell does not fulfil the cell
selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the measurements of all
neighbour cells indicated by the serving cell, regardless of the
measurement rules currently limiting UE measurement activities.

If the UE in RRC\_IDLE has not found any new suitable cell based on
searches and measurements using the intra-frequency, inter-frequency and

#### 4.2.2.3 Measurements of intra-frequency NR cells

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP and SS-RSRQ measurements of the identified intra-frequency cells
without an explicit intra-frequency neighbour list containing physical
layer cell identities.

The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable
intra-frequency cell meets the reselection criteria defined in
TS38.304\[1\] within T~detect,NR\_Intra~ when that Treselection= 0 . An
intra frequency cell is considered to be detectable according to the
conditions defined in Annex B.1.2 for a corresponding Band.

The UE shall measure SS-RSRP and SS-RSRQ at least every
T~measure,NR\_Intra~ (see table 4.2.2.3-1) for intra-frequency cells
that are identified and measured according to the measurement rules.

The UE shall filter SS-RSRP and SS-RSRQ measurements of each measured
intra-frequency cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of
measurements used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be
spaced by at least T~measure,NR\_Intra~/2.

The UE shall not consider a NR neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it
is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell.

For an intra-frequency cell that has been already detected, but that has
not been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be
capable of evaluating that the intra-frequency cell has met reselection
criterion defined in TS38.304 \[1\] within T~evaluate,NR\_Intra~ when
T~reselection~ = 0 as specified in table 4.2.2.3-1 provided that:

> when *rangeToBestCell* is not configured:

\- the cell is at least 3 dB better ranked in FR1 or 4.5 dB better
ranked in FR2.

> when *rangeToBestCell* is configured:
>
> \- the cell has the highest number of beams above the threshold
> *absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation* among all detected cells whose
> cell-ranking criterion R value in TS38.304 \[1\] is within
> *rangeToBestCell* of the cell-ranking criterion R value of the highest
> ranked cell.
>
> \- if there are multiple such cells, the cell has the highest rank
> among them.

\- the cell is at least 3dB better ranked in FR1 or 4.5dB better ranked
in FR2 if the current serving cell is among them.

When evaluating cells for reselection, the SSB side conditions apply to
both serving and non-serving intra-frequency cells.

If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the intra-frequency
cell is satisfied with the reselection criteria which are defined in
TS38.304 \[1\], the UE shall evaluate this intra-frequency cell for the
T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains satisfied with the reselection
criteria within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.4 Measurements of inter-frequency NR cells

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP or SS-RSRQ measurements of identified inter-frequency cells if
carrier frequency information is provided by the serving cell, even if
no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is
provided.

If Srxlev \> S~nonIntraSearchP~ and Squal \> S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the
UE shall search for inter-frequency layers of higher priority at least
every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where T~higher\_priority\_search~ is
described in clause 4.2.2.7.

If Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the UE
shall search for and measure inter-frequency layers of higher, equal or
lower priority in preparation for possible reselection. In this
scenario, the minimum rate at which the UE is required to search for and
measure higher priority layers shall be the same as that defined below
in this clause.

The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable
inter-frequency cell meets the reselection criteria defined in TS38.304
\[1\] within K~carrier~ \* T~detect,NR\_Inter~ if at least carrier
frequency information is provided for inter-frequency neighbour cells by
the serving cells when T~reselection~ = 0 provided that the reselection
criteria is met by a margin of at least 5 dB in FR1 or 6.5 dB in FR2 for
reselections based on ranking or 6 dB in FR1 or 7.5 dB in FR2 for
SS-RSRP reselections based on absolute priorities or 4 dB in FR1 and
4 dB in FR2 for SS-RSRQ reselections based on absolute priorities. The
parameter K~carrier~ is the number of NR inter-frequency carriers
indicated by the serving cell. An inter-frequency cell is considered to
be detectable according to the conditions defined in Annex B.1.3 for a
corresponding Band.

When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every T~measure,NR\_Inter~. If, after
detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of
reselection. However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements
specified later in this clause shall still be met by the UE before it
makes any determination that it may stop measuring the cell. If the UE
detects on a NR carrier a cell whose physical identity is indicated as
not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to perform
measurements on that cell.

The UE shall measure SS-RSRP or SS-RSRQ at least every K~carrier~ \*
T~measure,NR\_Inter~ (see table 4.2.2.4-1) for identified lower or equal
priority inter-frequency cells. If the UE detects on a NR carrier a cell
whose physical identity is indicated as not allowed for that carrier in
the measurement control system information of the serving cell, the UE
is not required to perform measurements on that cell.

The UE shall filter SS-RSRP or SS-RSRQ measurements of each measured
higher, lower and equal priority inter-frequency cell using at least 2
measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at
least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
T~measure,NR\_Inter~/2.

The UE shall not consider a NR neighbour cell in cell reselection, if it
is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell.

For an inter-frequency cell that has been already detected, but that has
not been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be
capable of evaluating that the inter-frequency cell has met reselection
criterion defined TS 38.304 \[1\] within K~carrier~ \*
T~evaluate,NR\_Inter~ when T~reselection~ = 0 as specified in table
4.2.2.4-1 provided that the reselection criteria is met by

> \- the condition when performing equal priority reselection and
>
> when *rangeToBestCell* is not configured:

\- the cell is at least 5dB better ranked in FR1 or 6.5dB better ranked
in FR2 or.

> when *rangeToBestCell* is configured:
>
> \- the cell has the highest number of beams above the threshold
> *absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation* among all detected cells whose
> cell-ranking criterion R value in TS38.304 \[1\] is within
> *rangeToBestCell* of the cell-ranking criterion R value of the highest
> ranked cell.
>
> \- if there are multiple such cells, the cell has the highest rank
> among them

\- the cell is at least 5dB better ranked in FR1 or 6.5dB better ranked
in FR2 if the current serving cell is among them. Or

> \- 6dB in FR1 or 7.5dB in FR2 for SS-RSRP reselections based on
> absolute priorities or
>
> \- 4dB in FR1 or 4dB in FR2 for SS-RSRQ reselections based on absolute
> priorities.

When evaluating cells for reselection, the SSB side conditions apply to
both serving and inter-frequency cells.

If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency
cell is satisfied with the reselection criteria, the UE shall evaluate
this inter-frequency cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell
remains satisfied with the reselection criteria within this duration,
then the UE shall reselect that cell.

The UE is not expected to meet the measurement requirements for an
inter-frequency carrier under DRX cycle=320 ms defined in Table
4.2.2.4-1 under the following conditions:

> \- T~SMTC\_intra~ = T~SMTC\_inter~ = 160 ms; where T~SMTC\_intra~ and
> T~SMTC\_inter~ are periodicities of the SMTC occasions configured for
> the intra-frequency carrier and the inter-frequency carrier
> respectively, and
>
> \- SMTC occasions configured for the inter-frequency carrier occur up
> to 1 ms before the start or up to 1 ms after the end of the SMTC
> occasions configured for the intra-frequency carrier, and
>
> \- SMTC occasions configured for the intra-frequency carrier and for
> the inter-frequency carrier occur up to 1 ms before the start or up to
> 1 ms after the end of the paging occasion in TS38.304 \[1\].

#### 4.2.2.5 Measurements of inter-RAT E-UTRAN cells

If Srxlev \> S~nonIntraSearchP~ and Squal \> S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the
UE shall search for inter-RAT E-UTRAN layers of higher priority at least
every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where T~higher\_priority\_search~ is
described in clause 4.2.2

If Srxlev ≤ S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~ then the UE
shall search for and measure inter-RAT E-UTRAN layers of higher, lower
priority in preparation for possible reselection. In this scenario, the
minimum rate at which the UE is required to search for and measure
higher priority inter-RAT E-UTRAN layers shall be the same as that
defined below for lower priority RATs.

The requirements in this clause apply for inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD
measurements and E-UTRA TDD measurements. When the measurement rules
indicate that inter-RAT E-UTRAN cells are to be measured, the UE shall
measure RSRP and RSRQ of detected E-UTRA cells in the neighbour
frequency list at the minimum measurement rate specified in this clause.
The parameter N~EUTRA\_carrier~ is the total number of configured E-UTRA
carriers in the neighbour frequency list. The UE shall filter RSRP and
RSRQ measurements of each measured E-UTRA cell using at least 2
measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at
least two measurements shall be spaced by at least T~measure,EUTRAN~/2.

An inter-RAT E-UTRA cell is considered to be detectable provided the
following conditions are fulfilled:

\- the same conditions as for inter-frequency RSRP measurements
specified in TS 36.133 \[15, Annex B.1.2\] are fulfilled for a
corresponding Band, and

\- the same conditions as for inter-frequency RSRQ measurements
specified in TS 36.133 \[15, Annex B.1.2\] are fulfilled for a
corresponding Band.

\- SCH conditions specified in TS 36.133 \[15, Annex B.1.2\] are
fulfilled for a corresponding Band

The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cell meets the reselection criteria defined in TS38.304 \[1\]
within (N~EUTRA\_carrier~) \* T~detect,EUTRAN~ when Srxlev ≤
S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~ when T~reselection~ = 0
provided that the reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least
6dB for RSRP reselections based on absolute priorities or 4dB for RSRQ
reselections based on absolute priorities.

Cells which have been detected shall be measured at least every
(N~EUTRA\_carrier~) \* T~measure,EUTRAN~ when Srxlev ≤
S~nonIntraSearchP~ or Squal ≤ S~nonIntraSearchQ~.

When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every T~measure,EUTRAN~. If, after detecting
a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection
has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the
detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later
in this clause shall still be met by the UE before it makes any
determination that it may stop measuring the cell.

If the UE detects on an inter-RAT E-UTRAN carrier a cell whose physical
identity is indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement
control system information of the serving cell, the UE is not required
to perform measurements on that cell.

The UE shall not consider an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell in cell reselection,
if it is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell.

For a cell that has been already detected, but that has not been
reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that an already identified inter-RAT E-UTRA cell has met
reselection criterion defined in TS 38.304 \[1\] within
(N~EUTRA\_carrier~) \* T~evaluate,EUTRAN~ when T~reselection~ = 0 as
speficied in table 4.2.2.5-1 provided that the reselection criteria is
met by a margin of at least 6dB for RSRP reselections based on absolute
priorities or 4dB for RSRQ reselections based on absolute priorities.

If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and the inter-RAT E-UTRA
cell is satisfied with the reselection criteria which are defined in
TS 38.304 \[1\], the UE shall evaluate this E-UTRA cell for the
T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains satisfied with the reselection
criteria within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.6 Maximum interruption in paging reception

UE shall perform the cell re-selection with minimum interruption in
monitoring downlink channels for paging reception.

At intra-frequency and inter-frequency cell re-selection, the UE shall
monitor the downlink of serving cell for paging reception until the UE
is capable to start monitoring downlink channels of the target
intra-frequency and inter-frequency cell for paging reception. The
interruption time shall not exceed T~SI-NR~ +
2\*T~target\_cell\_SMTC\_period~ ms.

At inter-RAT cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the downlink of
serving cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to start
monitoring downlink channels for paging reception of the target
inter-RAT cell. For NR to E-UTRAN cell re-selection the interruption
time must not exceed T~SI-EUTRA~ + 55 ms.

T~SI-NR~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]
for an NR cell.

T~SI-EUTRA~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in TS 36.331 \[16\]
for an E-UTRAN cell.

These requirements assume sufficient radio conditions, so that decoding
of system information can be made without errors and does not take into
account cell re-selection failure.

#### 4.2.2.7 General requirements

The UE shall search every layer of higher priority at least every
T~higher\_priority\_search~ = (60 \* N~layers~) seconds, where N~layers~
is the total number of higher priority NR and E-UTRA carrier frequencies
broadcasted in system information.

5.1 Cell Re-selection
---------------------

### 5.1.1 Introduction

The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable
cell and camp on it.

When the UE is in *Camped Normally* state on a cell, the UE shall
attempt to detect, synchronise, and monitor intra-frequency,
inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated by the serving cell. For
intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells the serving cell may not
provide explicit neighbour list but carrier frequency information and
bandwidth information only. UE measurement activity is also controlled
by measurement rules defined in TS38.304 \[1\], allowing the UE to limit
its measurement activity.

Where:

T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the
UE. If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target
cell is an unknown intra-frequency cell and the target cell Es/Iot≥-2
dB, then T~search~ = T~rs~ ms. If the target cell is an unknown
inter-frequency cell and the target cell Es/Iot≥-2 dB, then T~search~ =
3\* T~rs~ ms. Regardless of whether DRX is in use by the UE, T~search~
shall still be based on non-DRX target cell search times.

> T~processing~ is time for UE processing. T~processing~ can be up to

T~rs~ is the SMTC periodicity of the target NR cell if the UE has been
provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cellin the handover
command, otherwise Trs is the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having
the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing. If the measObjectNRs

which is up to UE implementation. If the UE is not provided SMTC
configuration or measurement object on this frequency, the requirement

When inter-frequency handover is commanded, the interruption time shall
be less than T~interrupt~

T~interrupt~ = T~search~ + T~IU~ + T~processing~ + T~∆~ + T~margin~ ms

Where:

cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the
UE. If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target
cell is an unknown inter-frequency cell and the target cell Es/Iot ≥ -2
dB, then T~search~ = 3\* T~rs~ ms. Regardless of whether DRX is in use
by the UE, T~search~ shall still be based on non-DRX target cell search

provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in the handover
command, otherwise T~rs~ is the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR

radio access mode of PCell from NR to E-UTRAN. The handover procedure is
initiated from NR with a RRC message that implies a handover as
described in TS 38.331 \[2\]. The requirements in this clause are
applicable to SA NR, NE-DC and NR-DC.

If PRACH occasion is configured in radio frames with even SFN and the
relative time difference between radio frame *i* in the current cell and
the target cell is not less than 153600⋅Ts, the longer handover delay is
expected.

##### 6.1.2.1.2 Handover delay

When the UE receives a RRC message implying handover to E-UTRAN the UE
shall be ready to start the transmission of the uplink PRACH channel in
E-UTRA within D~handover~ ms from the end of the last TTI containing the
RRC command. D~handover~ is defined as

D~handover~ = T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ + T~interrupt~

Where:

T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~: it is the RRC procedure delay, which is 50ms

T~interrupt~: it is the time between end of the last TTI containing the
RRC command on the NR PDSCH and the time the UE starts transmission of
the PRACH in E-UTRAN, excluding T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~. T~interrupt~
is defined in clause 6.1.2.1.3.

##### 6.1.2.1.3 Interruption time

When the inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN is commanded, the interruption
time shall be less than T~interrupt~

T~interrupt~ =T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms

Where:

T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the
UE. If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target
cell is unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful cell
detection on the first attempt, then T~search~ = 80 ms. Regardless of
whether DRX is in use by the UE, T~search~ shall still be based on
non-DRX target cell search times.

T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available
PRACH occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.

NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH
configuration used in the target cell.

In the interruption requirement a cell is known if it has been meeting
the relevant cell identification requirement during the last 5 seconds
otherwise it is unknown. Relevant E-UTRAN cell identification
requirements are described in clause 9.4.1.

6.2 RRC Connection Mobility Control
-----------------------------------

### 6.2.1 SA: RRC Re-establishment

#### 6.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on the UE regarding RRC connection
re-establishment procedure. RRC connection re-establishment is initiated
when a UE in RRC\_CONNECTED state loses RRC connection due to any of
failure cases, including radio link failure, handover failure, and RRC
connection reconfiguration failure. The RRC connection re-establishment
procedure is specified in clause 5.3.7 of TS 38.331 \[2\].

The requirements in this clause are applicable for RRC connection
re-establishment to NR cell.

#### 6.2.1.2 Requirements

In RRC\_CONNECTED state the UE shall be capable of sending
*RRCReestablishmentRequest* message within T~re-establish\_delay~
seconds from the moment it detects a loss in RRC connection. The total
RRC connection delay (T~re-establish\_delay~) shall be less than:

$$T_{re - establish\_ delay} = T_{UE\_ re - establish\_ delay} + T_{UL\_ grant}$$

T~UL\_grant~: It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
grant from the target PCell. The uplink grant is required to transmit
*RRCReestablishmentRequest* message.

The UE re-establishment delay (T~UE\_re-establish\_delay~) is specified
in clause 6.2.1.2.1.

##### 6.2.1.2.1 UE Re-establishment delay requirement

The UE re-establishment delay (T~UE\_re-establish\_delay~) is the time
between the moments when any of the conditions requiring RRC
re-establishment as defined in clause 5.3.7 in TS 38.331 \[2\] is
detected by the UE and when the UE sends PRACH to the target PCell. The
UE re-establishment delay (T~UE\_re-establish\_delay~) requirement shall
be less than:

$$T_{UE\_ re - establish\_ delay} = 50\ \text{ms} + T_{identify\_ intra\_ NR} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{identify\_ inter\_ NR,i} + T_{SI - NR} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

The intra-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable if
each relevant SSB can satisfy that:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.2 and 10.1.3 are
fulfilled for a corresponding NR Band for FR1 and FR2, respectively, and

\- the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for
a corresponding NR Band are fulfilled.

The inter-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable when
for each relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.4 and 10.1.5 are
fulfilled for a corresponding NR Band for FR1 and FR2, respectively, and

\- the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for
a corresponding NR Band are fulfilled.

T~identify\_intra\_NR~: It is the time to identify the target
intra-frequency NR cell and it depends on whether the target NR cell is
known cell or unknown cell and on the FR of the target NR cell. If the
UE is not configured with intra-frequency NR carrier for RRC
re-establishment then T~identify\_intra\_NR~=0; otherwise
T~identify\_intra\_NR~ shall not exceed the values defined in Table
6.2.1.2.1-1.

T~identify\_inter\_NR,i~: It is the time to identify the target
inter-frequency NR cell on inter-frequency carrier *i* configured for
RRC re-establishment and it depends on whether the target NR cell is
known cell or unknown cell and on the FR of the target NR cell.
T~identify\_inter\_NR,i~ shall not exceed the values defined in Table
6.2.1.2.1-2.

T~SMTC~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the
intra-frequency carrier. If the UE has been provided with higher layer
in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2*, T~smtc~ follows *smtc1* or
*smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the target cell.

T~SMTC,i~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the
inter-frequency carrier *i*. If it is not configured, the UE may assume
that the target SSB periodicity is no larger than 20 ms.

T~SI-NR~: It is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure
delay of system information blocks defined in TS 38.331 \[2\] for the
target NR cell.

T~PRACH:~ It is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available
PRACH occasion in the target NR cell. T~PRACH~ can be up to the
summation of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to
PRACH occasion associated period is defined in the table 8.1-1 of TS
38.213 \[3\].

*N~freq~*: It is the total number of NR frequencies to be monitored for
RRC re-establishment; N~freq~ = 1 if the target intra-frequency NR cell
is known, else N~freq~ = 2 and T~identify\_intra\_NR~ = 0 if the target
inter-frequency NR cell is known.

There is no requirement if the target cell does not contain the UE
context.

In the requirement defined in the below tables, the target FR1 cell is
known if it has been meeting the relevant cell identification
requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise it is unknown.

### 6.2.2 Random access

#### 6.2.2.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on the UE regarding random access
procedure. The random access procedure is initiated to establish uplink
time synchronization for a UE which either has not acquired or has lost
its uplink synchronization, or to convey UE's request Other SI, or for
beam failure recovery. The random access is specified in clause 8 of TS
38.213 \[3\] and the control of the RACH transmission is specified in

If the random access procedure is initialized for beam failure recovery
and if the contention-free Random Access Resources and the
contention-free PRACH occasions for beam failure recovery request
associated with any of the SSBs and/or CSI-RSs is configured, UE shall
have the capability to select the Random Access Preamble corresponding
to the selected SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB* amongst the
associated SSBs or the selected CSI-RS with CSI-RSRP above
*rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS* amongst the associated CSI-RSs, and to transmit
Random Access Preamble on the next available PRACH occasion from the
PRACH occasions corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the

selected CSI-RS, and PRACH occasion shall be randomly selected with
equal probability amongst the selected SSB assocated PRACH occasions or
the selected CSI-RS associated PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously
but on different subcarriers, as specified in clause 5.1.2 in

### 6.2.3 SA: RRC Connection Release with Redirection

#### 6.2.3.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on the UE regarding RRC connection
release with redirection procedure. RRC connection release with
redirection is initiated by the *RRCRelease* message with redirection to
E-UTRAN or NR from NR specified in TS 38.331 \[2\]. The RRC connection
release with redirection procedure is specified in clause 5.3.8 of TS

The UE shall be capable of performing the RRC connection release with
redirection to the target NR cell within
T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~.

The time delay (T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~) is the time
between the end of the last slot containing the RRC command,
"*RRCRelease*" (TS 38.331 \[2\]) on the NR PDSCH and the time the UE
starts to send random access to the target NR cell. The time delay
(T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~) shall be less than:

T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~ = T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ +
T~identify-NR~ + T~SI-NR~ + T~RACH~

SSB, the side conditions should be met that,

-   the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.5
    for a corresponding NR Band are fulfilled.

T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~: It is the RRC procedure delay for processing
the received message "*RRCRelease*" as defined in clause 6.2.2 of TS
38.331 \[2\].

T~identify-NR~: It is the time to identify the target NR cell and
depends on the FR of the target NR cell. It is defined in Table
6.2.3.2.1-1. Note that T~identify-NR~ = T~PSS/SSS-sync~ + T~meas~, in
which T~PSS/SSS-sync~ is the cell search time and T~meas~ is the
measurement time due to cell selection criteria evaluation.

T~SI-NR~: It is the time required for acquiring all the relevant system
information of the target NR cell. This time depends upon whether the UE
is provided with the relevant system information of the target NR cell
or not by the old NR cell before the RRC connection is released.

T~RACH:~ It is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available
PRACH occasion in the target NR cell. T~RACH~ can be up to the summation
of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to PRACH
occasion associated period is defined in the table 8.1-1 of TS 38.213
\[3\].

T~rs~ is the SMTC periodicity of the target NR cell if the UE has been
provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in the
redirection command, otherwise T~rs~ is the SMTC periodicity configured
in the *measObjectNR* having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier
spacing configured for the RRC connection release with redirection. If
the measObjectNRs having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing
configured by MN and SN have different SMTC, T~rs~ is the periodicity of
one of the SMTC which is up to UE implementation. If the UE is not
provided with SMTC configuration or measurement object for the frequency
which is also configured for the RRC connection release with redirection
then:

\- the requirement in this clause is applied with T~rs~ = 20 ms if the
SSB transmission periodicity is not larger than 20 ms; otherwise,

\- there is no requirement if the SSB transmission periodicity is larger
than 20ms.

  Note: If the UE has been provided with higher layer signaling of *smtc2* specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] prior to the redirection command, T~rs~ follows *smtc1* or *smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the target cell.   

##### 6.2.3.2.2 RRC connection release with redirection to E-UTRAN

The UE shall be capable of performing the RRC connection release with
redirection to the target E-UTRAN cell within
T~connection\_release\_redirect\_E-UTRA~.

The time delay (T~connection\_release\_redirect\_E-UTRA~) is the time
between the end of the last slot containing the RRC command,
"*RRCRelease*" (TS 38.331 \[2\]) on the PDSCH and the time the UE starts
to send random access to the target E-UTRA cell. The time delay
(T~connection\_release\_redirect\_E-UTRA~) shall be less than:

T~connection\_release\_redirect\_E-UTRA~ = T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ +
T~identify-E-UTRA~ + T~SI-E-UTRA~ + T~RACH~

The target E-UTRA FDD or TDD cell shall be considered detectable
provided the following conditions are fulfilled:

\- the same conditions as for inter-frequency RSRP measurements
specified in annex B.1.2 of TS 36.133 \[15\] are fulfilled for a
corresponding Band, and

\- the same conditions as for inter-frequency RSRQ measurements
specified in annex B.1.2 of TS 36.133 \[15\] are fulfilled for a
corresponding Band, and

\- SCH conditions specified in annex B.1.2 of TS 36.133 \[15\] are
fulfilled for a corresponding Band.

T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~: It is the RRC procedure delay for processing
the received message "*RRCRelease*" as defined in clause 6.2.2 of TS
38.331 \[2\].

T~identify-E-UTRA~: It is the time to identify the target E-UTRA cell.
It shall be less than 320 ms.

T~SI-E-UTRA~: It is the time required for acquiring all the relevant
system information of the target E-UTRA cell. This time depends upon
whether the UE is provided with the relevant system information (SI) of
the target E-UTRA cell or not by the old NR cell before the RRC
connection is released.

T~RACH~: It is the delay caused due to the random access procedure when
sending random access to the target E-UTRA cell.

7 Timing
========

7.1 UE transmit timing
----------------------

### 7.1.1 Introduction

The UE shall have capability to follow the frame timing change of the
reference cell in connected state. The uplink frame transmission takes
place before the reception of the first detected path (in time) of the
corresponding downlink frame from the reference cell. For serving
cell(s) in pTAG, UE shall use the SpCell as the reference cell for
deriving the UE transmit timing for cells in the pTAG. For serving
cell(s) in sTAG, UE shall use any of the activated SCells as the
reference cell for deriving the UE transmit timing for the cells in the
sTAG. UE initial transmit timing accuracy and gradual timing adjustment
requirements are defined in the following requirements.

### 7.1.2 Requirements

The UE initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal to
±T~e~ where the timing error limit value T~e~ is specified in Table
7.1.2-1. This requirement applies:

\- when it is the first transmission in a DRX cycle for PUCCH, PUSCH and
SRS or it is the PRACH transmission.

The UE shall meet the Te requirement for an initial transmission
provided that at least one SSB is available at the UE during the last
160 ms. The reference point for the UE initial transmit timing control
requirement shall be the downlink timing of the reference cell minus
![](./media/image7.wmf){width="1.2527777777777778in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}. The downlink timing is defined as the
time when the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding
downlink frame is received from the reference cell. *N*~TA~ for PRACH is
defined as 0.

![](./media/image7.wmf){width="1.2527777777777778in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"} (in *T~c~* units) for other channels is
the difference between UE transmission timing and the downlink timing
immediately after when the last timing advance in clause 7.3 was
applied. *N*~TA~ for other channels is not changed until next timing
advance is received. The value
of![](./media/image8.wmf){width="0.5472222222222223in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}depends on the duplex mode of the cell in
which the uplink transmission takes place and the frequency range (FR).
![](./media/image8.wmf){width="0.5472222222222223in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}is defined in Table 7.1.2-2.

adjustment shall be T~q~.

2\) The minimum aggregate adjustment rate shall be T~p~ per second.

3\) The maximum aggregate adjustment rate shall be T~q~ per 200 ms.

where the maximum autonomous time adjustment step T~q~ and the aggregate
adjustment rate T~p~ are specified in Table 7.1.2.1-1.

internally in the UE. They do not include the following:

\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. UE
reaction time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is
fulfilled), or

\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of a UE timer (e.g. slot alignment when UE sends messages at
timer expiry).

7.3 Timing advance
------------------

### 7.3.1 Introduction

The timing advance is initiated from gNB to UE in EN-DC, NR-DC, NE-DC
and NR SA operation modes, with MAC message that implies the adjustment
of the timing advance, as defined in clause 5.2 of TS 38.321 \[7\].

### 7.3.2 Requirements

#### 7.3.2.1 Timing Advance adjustment delay

UE shall adjust the timing of its uplink transmission timing at time
slot *n*+ *k+1* for a timing advance command received in time slot *n*,
and the value of *k* is defined in clause 4.2 in TS 38.213 \[3\]. The
same requirement applies also when the UE is not able to transmit a
configured uplink transmission due to the channel assessment procedure.

#### 7.3.2.2 Timing Advance adjustment accuracy

The UE shall adjust the timing of its transmissions with a relative
accuracy better than or equal to the UE Timing Advance adjustment
accuracy requirement in Table 7.3.2.2-1, to the signalled timing advance
value compared to the timing of preceding uplink transmission. The
timing advance command step is defined in TS 38.213 \[3\].

8.1 Radio Link Monitoring
-------------------------

### 8.1.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 8.1 apply for radio link monitoring on:

\- PCell in SA NR, NR-DC and NE-DC operation mode,

\- PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode.

The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell and PSCell as specified in
TS 38.213 \[3\]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all
CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required to perform RLM
outside the active DL BWP.

On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio link
quality and compare it to the thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the
purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell.

The threshold Q~out~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the out-of-sync
block error rate (BLER~out~) as defined in Table 8.1.1-1. For SSB based
radio link monitoring, Q~out\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1.2.1-1. For CSI-RS
based radio link monitoring, Q~out\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1.3.1-1.

The threshold Q~in~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link quality can be received with significantly higher reliability than
at Q~out~ and shall correspond to the in-sync block error rate
(BLER~in~) as defined in Table 8.1.1-1. For SSB based radio link
monitoring, Q~in\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based
radio link monitoring, Q~in\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1.3.1-2.

The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out~) and in-sync block error
rate (BLER~in~) are determined from the network configuration via
parameter *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* signalled by higher layers. When
UE is not configured with *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* from the
network, UE determines out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from
Configuration \#0 in Table 8.1.1-1 by default. All requirements in
clause 8.1 are applicable for BLER Configuration \#0 in Table 8.1.1-1.

  Configuration   BLER~out~   BLER~in~
  --------------- ----------- ----------
  0               10%         2%

UE shall be able to monitor up to N~RLM~ RLM-RS resources of the same or
different types in each corresponding carrier frequency range, depending
on a maximum number of SSBs per half frame according to TS 38.213 \[3\],
where N~RLM~ is specified in Table 8.1.1-2 according TS 38.213 \[3\],
and meet the requirements as specified in clause 8.1. UE is not required
to meet the requirements in clause 8.1 if RLM-RS is not configured and
no TCI state for PDCCH is activated.

#### 8.1.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ ms period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ ms period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in Table
8.1.2.2-1 for FR1.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in Table
8.1.2.2-2 for FR2 with scaling factor N=8.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, and these
measurement gaps are overlapping with some but not all occasions of the
SSB; and

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC
period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and the
RLM-RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap
and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{Min(MGRP,\ \ T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully
overlapped with measurement gap

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the RLM-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

-   not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
    1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
    *SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
    indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is
    configured, where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of
    *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects merged
    on the same serving carrier, and,

-   not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by
    *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
    indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
    symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
    *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*
T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the same FR2
band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

#### 8.1.2.3 Measurement restrictions for SSB based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1, when the SSB OFDM symbols used for RLM fully or partially
overlap with CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for RLM without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for RLM measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based
RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.1.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring

#### 8.1.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS based RLM-RS
resource configured for PCell or PSCell, provided that the CSI-RS
configured for RLM is actually transmitted within UE active DL BWP
during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.1.3.2. UE is
not expected to perform radio link monitoring measurements on the CSI-RS
configured as RLM-RS if the CSI-RS is not in the active TCI state of any
CORESET configured in the UE active BWP.

#### 8.1.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ ms period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ ms period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
Table 8.1.3.2-1 for FR1.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
Table 8.1.3.2-2 for FR2 with scaling factor N=1.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~
apply provided that the CSI-RS for RLM is not in a resource set
configured with repetition ON. The requirements do not apply when the
CSI-RS resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS
resource for RLM and the TCI state information of the CSI-RS resource is
not given, wherein the TCI state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for
L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, and these
measurement gaps are overlapping with some but not all occasions of the
CSI-RS; and

\- P = 1, when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P = 1, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement
gap and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap and the RLM-RS
resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5 ×
T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{Min(MGRP,\ T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully
overlapped with measurement gap

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped
with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the RLM-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*
T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the same FR2
band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for RLM and SMTC means that CSI-RS
based RLM is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

The values of M~out~ and M~in~ used in Table 8.1.3.2-1 and Table
8.1.3.2-2 are defined as:

\- M~out~ = 20 and M~in~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource configured for RLM
is transmitted with higher layer CSI-RS parameter *density* \[6, clause
7.4.1\] set to 3 and over the bandwidth ≥ 24 PRBs.

#### 8.1.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol
as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for RLM in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, or L1-RSRP measurement is
within the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions according to its
capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS for RLM measurement without
restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM and SSB.
Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as another
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be able to
measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for RLM and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM
is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for RLM and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for RLM or the other CSI-RS in a resource set configured
with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any
restriction.

### 8.1.4 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the UE transitions between DRX and no DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, for each RLM-RS resource, for a duration of time
equal to the evaluation period corresponding to the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first
mode and the second mode. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use
an evaluation period corresponding to the second mode for each RLM-RS
resource. This requirement shall be applied to both out-of-sync
evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the monitored cell.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of RLM resources to a
second configuration of RLM resources that is different from the first
configuration, for each RLM resource present in the second
configuration, for a duration of time equal to the evaluation period
corresponding to the second configuration after the transition occurs,
the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no less than the minimum
of evaluation periods corresponding to the first configuration and the
second configuration. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second configuration for each RLM
resource present in the second configuration. This requirement shall be
applied to both out-of-sync evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the
monitored cell.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of active TCI state
of the CORESET to a second configuration of active TCI state of the
CORESET, for each CSI-RS for RLM present in the second configuration,
the UE shall use an evaluation period corresponding to the second
configuration from the time of transition. This requirement shall be
applied to both out-of-sync evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the
monitored cell.

### 8.1.5 Minimum requirement for UE turning off the transmitter

The transmitter power of the UE in the monitored cell shall be turned
off within 40ms after expiry of T310 timer as specified in TS 38.331
\[2\].

### 8.1.6 Minimum requirement for L1 indication

When the downlink radio link quality on all the configured RLM-RS
resources is worse than Q~out~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
out-of-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the out-of-sync indications as specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

When the downlink radio link quality on at least one of the configured
RLM-RS resources is better than Q~in~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
in-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3 filter
shall be applied to the in-sync indications as specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

The out-of-sync and in-sync evaluations for the configured RLM-RS
resources shall be performed as specified in clause 5 in
TS 38.213 \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval~.

When DRX is not used T~Indication\_interval~ is max(10ms, T~RLM-RS,M~),
where T~RLM,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all configured RLM-RS
resources for the monitored cell, which corresponds to T~SSB~ specified
in clause 8.1.2 if the RLM-RS resource is SSB, or T~CSI-RS~ specified in
clause 8.1.3 if the RLM-RS resource is CSI-RS.

In case DRX is used, T~Indication\_interval~ is Max(10ms, 1.5 ×
DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 × T~RLM-RS,M~) if DRX cycle\_length is less than
or equal to 320ms, and T~Indication\_interval~ is DRX\_cycle\_length if
DRX cycle\_length is greater than 320ms. Upon start of T310 timer as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\], the UE shall monitor the configured RLM-RS
resources for recovery using the evaluation period and layer 1
indication interval corresponding to the no DRX mode until the expiry or
stop of T310 timer.

### 8.1.7 Scheduling availability of UE during radio link monitoring

When the reference signal to be measured for RLM has different
subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH or is on frequency range 2, there
are restrictions on the scheduling availability as described in the
following clauses.

#### 8.1.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
performed with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1.

#### 8.1.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to radio link
monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to radio link monitoring based on SSB as RLM -RS.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols
> to be measured for radio link monitoring.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell applies to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the
restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is
performed, there are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s)
in the bands due to radio link monitoring performed on FR1 serving PCell
or PSCell in different bands.

#### 8.1.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to radio link
monitoring on an FR2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

\- If the RLM-RS is CSI-RS which is type-D QCLed with active TCI state
for PDCCH or PDSCH, and the CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS resource set with
repetition ON,

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
based on the CSI-RS.

\- Otherwise

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on RLM-RS symbols
to be measured for radio link monitoring.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on FR2 serving PCell or PSCell applies to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with
restricted symbols.

For FR2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 3, UE is expected to receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be
measured for RLM; and

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 2, UE is expected to receive PDSCH that corresponds to the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be
measured for RLM.

#### 8.1.7.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA and NR-DC

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to radio
link monitoring performed on FR2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to radio
link monitoring performed on FR1 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

NR-DC in Rel-15 only includes the scenarios where all serving cells in
MCG are in FR1 and all serving cells in SCG are in FR2.

8.2 Interruption
----------------

### 8.2.1 EN-DC Interruption

#### 8.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause contains the requirements related to the interruptions on
PSCell, and SCell, when

E-UTRA PCell transitions between active and non-active during DRX, or

E-UTRA PCell transitions from non-DRX to DRX, or

E-UTRA SCell in MCG or SCell in SCG is added or released, or

E-UTRA SCell in MCG or SCell in SCG is activated or deactivated, or

measurements on SCC with deactivated SCell in either E-UTRA MCG or NR
SCG, or

a supplementary UL carrier or an UL carrier is configured or
de-configured, or

UL/DL BWP is switched on PSCell or SCell in SCG.

The requirements shall apply for E-UTRA-NR DC with an E-UTRA PCell.

This clause contains interruptions where victim cell is PSCell or SCell
belonging to SCG. Requirements for interruptions requirements when the
victim cell is E-UTRA PCell or E-UTRA SCell belonging to MCG are
specified in TS 36.133 \[15\].

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gaps, interruptions
to the PSCell or activated SCG SCells may be caused by EUTRA PCell,
EUTRA SCells or SCells on any frequency range. For UE which support
per-FR gaps, interruptions to the PSCell or activated SCG SCells may be
caused by EUTRA PCell, EUTRA SCells or SCells on the same frequency
range as the victim cell.

#### 8.2.1.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.1.2.1 Interruptions at transitions between active and non-active during DRX

Interruption on PSCell and the activated SCell if configured due to
E-UTRA PCell transitions between active and non-active druing DRX when
PSCell or SCell is in non-DRX are allowed with up to 1% probability of
missed ACK/NACK when the configured E-UTRA PCell DRX cycle is less than
640 ms, and 0.625% probability of missed ACK/NACK is allowed when the
configured E-UTRA PCell DRX cycle is 640 ms or longer. Each interruption
shall not exceed X slot as defined in table 8.2.1.2.1-1.

provided the cell specific reference signals from the active serving
cells and the E-UTRA SCell being added or released are available in the
same slot, where T~SMTC\_duration~ is the longest SMTC duration among
all above active serving cells in SCG;

Where X1 and Y1 are specified in Table 8.2.1.2.3-1.

When one SCell in SCG is added or released:

\- the UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving cell in SCG:

\- of up to X1 slot, if the active serving cell is not in the same band
as any of the SCells being added or released, or

\- of up to Y1 slot + T~SMTC\_duration~ if the active serving cells are

##### 8.2.1.2.4 Interruptions at SCell activation/deactivation

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
PSCell and one SCell.

When one E-UTRA SCell in MCG is activated or deactivated:

\- the UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving cell in SCG:

\- of up to X2 slot, if the active serving cell is not in the same band
as the E-UTRA SCell being activated or deactivated, or

\- of up to max{Y2 slot + T~SMTC\_duration~, 5ms} if the active serving
cells are in the same band as the E-UTRA SCell being activated or
deactivated, provided the cell specific reference signals from the
active serving cells and the E-UTRA SCell being activated or deactivated
are available in the same slot, where T~SMTC\_duration~ is the longest
SMTC duration among all above active serving cells in SCG.

Where X2 and Y2 are specified in Table 8.2.1.2.4-1.

When one SCell in SCG is activated or deactivated:

\- an interruption on any active serving cell in SCG:

\- of up to X2 slot, if the active serving cell is not in the same band
as the SCell being activated or deactivated, or

\- of up to Y2 slot + T~SMTC\_duration~ if the active serving cells are
in the same band as the SCell being activated or deactivated, provided
the cell specific reference signals from the active serving cells and
the SCell being activated or deactivated are available in the same slot,
where, T~SMTC\_duration~ is

\- the longest SMTC duration among all above active serving cells in SCG
and the SCell being activated when one SCell is activated. If SSB
configuration (*absoluteFrequencySSB*) but no SMTC configuration is
provided for the SCell being activated, the SSB transmission periodicity
is assumed to be 5ms and T~SMTC\ duration~ for the SCell being activated
is x ms, where x = the number of consecutive subframes containing all
SSBs in one SSB burst transmitted by the SCell being activated. If no
SSB configuration (*absoluteFrequencySSB*) nor SMTC configuration is
provided for the SCell being activated, T~SMTC\ duration~ for the SCell
being activated is 0ms;

\- the longest SMTC duration among all above active serving cells in SCG
when one SCell is deactivated.

Where X2 and Y2 are specified in Table 8.2.1.2.4-2.

##### 8.2.1.2.7 Interruptions due to Active BWP switching Requirement

The requirements for DCI-based and timer-based BWP switches in this
clause only apply to the case that the BWP switch is performed on a
single CC.

When UE receives a DCI indicating UE to switch its active BWP involving
changes in any of the parameters listed in Table 8.2.1.2.7-2, the UE is
allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot to other active serving
cells if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching
involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the
parameters listed in Table 8.2.1.2.7-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR
gap, the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot to other
active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE is
performing BWP switching. X is defined in Table 8.2.1.2.7-1. The
starting time of interruption is only allowed within the BWP switching
delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2. Interruptions are
not allowed during BWP switch involving any other parameter change.

When a BWP timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]
expires, UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot to other
active serving cells due to switching its active BWP involving changes
in any of the parameters listed in Table 8.2.1.2.7-2 if the UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching involves SCS changing.
When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the parameters listed in
Table 8.2.1.2.7-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed
to cause interruption of up to X slot to other active serving cells in
the same frequency range wherein the UE is performing BWP switching. X
is defined in Table 8.2.1.2.7-1. The starting time of interruption is
only allowed within the BWP switching delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined
in clause 8.6.2. Interruptions are not allowed during BWP switch
involving any other parameter change.

When UE receives an RRC reconfiguration that only requests UE to switch
its active BWP on one single CC, the UE is allowed to cause interruption
of up to X slot to other active serving cells due to switching its
active BWP involving changes in any of the parameters listed in Table
8.2.1.2.7-2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP
switching involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in
any of the parameters listed in Table 8.2.1.2.7-2 and the UE is capable
of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot
to other active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE
is performing BWP switching. X is defined in Table 8.2.1.2.7-1. The
interruption is only allowed within the delay T~RRCprocessingDelay~ +
T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ defined in clause 8.6.3.

### 8.2.2 SA: Interruptions with Standalone NR Carrier Aggregation

#### 8.2.2.1 Introduction

This clause contains the requirements related to the interruptions on
PCell and activated SCell if configured, when

up to 7 SCells are configured, de-configured, activated or deactivated,
or

a supplementary UL carrier or an UL carrier is configured or
de-configured, or

measurements on SCC with deactivated SCell in NR SCG, or

UL/DL BWP is switched on PCell or SCell.

Note: interruptions at SCell addition/release, activation/deactivation
and during measurements on SCC may not be required by all UEs.

The interruptions shall not interrupt RRC signalling or ACK/NACKs
related to RRC reconfiguration procedure \[2\] for SCell
addition/release or MAC control signalling \[17\] for SCell
activation/deactivation command.

This clause additionally contains requirements related to interruptions
at inter-frequency SFTD between PCell in FR1 and neighbour cell in FR2.

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gap, interruptions to
the PCell and activated SCell may be caused by SCells on any frequency
range. For a UE which supports per-FR gap, interruptions to PCell and
activated SCell may be caused by SCells on the same frequency range as
the victim cell.

#### 8.2.2.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.2.2.1 Interruptions at SCell addition/release

When any number of SCells between one and 7 is added or released using
the same *RRCConnectionReconfiguration* message as defined in
TS 38.331 \[2\], the UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving
cell during the RRC reconfiguration procedure as follows:

##### 8.2.2.2.3 Interruptions during measurements on deactivated SCC

Interruptions on PCell or activated SCell(s) due to measurements when an
SCell is deactivated are allowed with up to 0.5% probability of missed
ACK/NACK when the configured *measCycleSCell \[2\] is 640 ms or longer.*

\- If the PCell or activated SCell(s) is not in the same band as the
deactivated SCell, the UE is only allowed to cause interruptions on
PCell or activated SCell(s) immediately before and immediately after an
SMTC. Each interruption shall not exceed requirement in Table
8.2.2.2.2-1.

\- If the PCell or activated SCell(s) is in the same band as the
deactivated SCell, the UE is only allowed to cause an interruption on
PCell or activated SCell(s) no earlier than X slots before
T~SMTC\_duration~ and no later than X slots after T~SMTC\_duration~,
provided the cell specific reference signals from the active serving
cells and the deactivated SCell are available in the same slot, where X
and T~SMTC\_duration~ are given by Table 8.2.2.2.3-1. The interruption
shall not exceed requirements in Table 8.2.2.2.3-1.

##### 8.2.2.2.4 Interruptions at UL carrier RRC reconfiguration

The requirements in this clause shall apply when a supplementary UL
carrier or an UL carrier is configured or de-configured in NR standalone
carrier aggregation as defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

When an UL carrier or supplementary UL carrier is configured or
de-configured, an interruption of up to the duration shown in table
8.2.2.2.4-1, is allowed during the RRC reconfiguration procedure \[2\]
on PCell and all activated SCells within the same FR as the reconfigured
uplink carrier. The interruption is for both uplink and downlink of
PCell and all the activated SCells within the same FR as the configured
or de-configured UL.

##### 8.2.2.2.5 Interruptions due to Active BWP switching Requirement

The requirements for DCI-based and timer-based BWP switches in this
clause only apply to the case that the BWP switch is performed on a
single CC.

When UE receives a DCI indicating UE to switch its active BWP involving
changes in any of the parameters listed in Table 8.2.2.2.5-2, the UE is
allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot to other active serving
cells if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching
involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the
parameters listed in Table 8.2.2.2.5-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR
gap the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot to other
active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE is
performing BWP switching. X is defined in Table 8.2.2.2.5-1. The
starting time of interruption is only allowed within the BWP switching
delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2. Interruptions are
not allowed during BWP switch involving any other parameter change.

When a BWP timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]
expires, UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot to other
active serving cells due to switching its active BWP involving changes
in any of the parameters listed in Table 8.2.2.2.5-2 if the UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching involves SCS changing.
When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the parameters listed in
Table 8.2.2.2.5-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed
to cause interruption of up to X slot to other active serving cells in
the same frequency range wherein the UE is performing BWP switching. X
is defined in Table 8.2.2.2.5-1. The starting time of interruption is
only allowed within the BWP switching delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined
in clause 8.6.2. Interruptions are not allowed during BWP switch
involving any other parameter change.

When UE receives an RRC reconfiguration that only requests UE to switch
its active BWP on one single CC, the UE is allowed to cause interruption
of up to X slot to other active serving cells due to switching its
active BWP involving changes in any of the parameters listed in Table
8.2.2.2.5-2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP
switching involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in
any of the parameters listed in Table 8.2.2.2.5-2 and the UE is capable
of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slot
to other active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE
is performing BWP switching. X is defined in Table 8.2.2.2.5-1. The
interruption is only allowed within the delay T~RRCprocessingDelay~ +
T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ defined in clause 8.6.3.

### 8.2.3 NE-DC Interruptions 

#### 8.2.3.1 Introduction

This clause contains the requirements related to the interruptions on
PCell and SCell, when

E-UTRA PSCell transitions between active and non-active during DRX, or

E-UTRA PSCell transitions from non-DRX to DRX, or

E-UTRA PSCell/SCell in SCG or SCell in MCG is added or released, or

E-UTRA PSCell/SCell in SCG or SCell in MCG is activated or deactivated,
or

measurements on SCC with deactivated SCell in either E-UTRA SCG or NR
MCG or

PUSCH/PUCCH carrier configuration and deconfiguration in NR MCG, or

UL/DL BWP is switched on PCell or SCell in MCG.

The requirements shall apply for NE-DC with an NR PCell.

This clause contains interruptions where victim cell is PCell or SCell
belonging to MCG. Requirements for interruptions requirements when the
victim cell is E-UTRA PSCell or E-UTRA SCell belonging to SCG are
specified in TS 36.133 \[15\].

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gap, interruptions to
the PCell, E-UTRA PSCell or activated MCG SCells may be caused by EUTRA
PSCell, EUTRA SCells or SCells on any frequency range. For UE which
support per-FR gap, interruptions to the PCell, E-UTRA PSCell or
activated MCG SCells may be caused by EUTRA PSCell, EUTRA SCells or
SCells on the same frequency range as the victim cell.

#### 8.2.3.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.3.2.1 Interruptions at transitions between active and non-active during DRX

Interruption on PCell and the activated SCell if configured due to
E-UTRA PSCell transitions between active and non-active druing DRX when
PCell or SCell is in non-DRX are allowed with up to 1% probability of
missed ACK/NACK when the configured E-UTRA PSCell DRX cycle is less than
640 ms, and 0.625% probability of missed ACK/NACK is allowed when the
configured E-UTRA PCell DRX cycle is 640 ms or longer. Each interruption
shall not exceed X slot as defined in table 8.2.3.2.1-1.

##### 8.2.3.2.6 Interruptions at UL carrier RRC reconfiguration

The requirements in this clause shall apply when a supplementary UL
carrier or an UL carrier is configured or de-configured in NE-DC.

When an UL carrier or supplementary UL carrier is configured or
deconfigured, an interruption of up to X4 slot as specified in Table
8.2.3.2.6-1, is allowed during the RRC reconfiguration procedure in
TS 38.331 \[2\] on PCell, all activated SCells within the same FR as the
reconfigured uplink carrier. The interruption is for both uplink and
downlink of PCell, all activated E-UTRA SCells, E-UTRA PSCell and all
activated SCells within the same FR as the configured or de-configured
UL.

##### 8.2.3.2.7 Interruptions due to Active BWP switching Requirement

The requirements for DCI-based and timer-based BWP switches in this
clause only apply to the case that the BWP switch is performed on a
single CC.

When UE receives a DCI indicating the UE to switch its active BWP, or
when a BWP timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]
expires, or when the UE receives an RRC command indicating the UE to
switch its active BWP, the UE is allowed an interruption on PCell and
any activated SCells as defined in clause 8.2.2.2.5.

### 8.2.4 NR-DC: Interruptions

#### 8.2.4.1 Introduction

> This clause contains the requirements related to the interruptions on
> PCell, PSCell and activated SCell if configured, when
>
> SCells are configured, de-configured, activated or deactivated or,
>
> a supplementary UL carrier or an UL carrier is configured or
> de-configured, or
>
> measurements on SCC with deactivated SCell in NR SCG, or

UL/DL BWP is switched on PCell, PSCell or SCell.transitions between
active and non-active during DRX, or

transitions from non-DRX to DRX.

Note: interruptions at SCell addition/release, activation/deactivation
and during measurements on SCC may not be required by all UEs.

The interruptions shall not interrupt RRC signalling or ACK/NACKs
related to RRC reconfiguration procedure \[2\] for SCell
addition/release or MAC control signalling \[17\] for SCell
activation/deactivation command. How to specify this is FFS.

The requirements shall apply for NR-DC with an NR PCell, PSCell or
SCell.

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gap, interruptions to
the PCell and activated SCell may be caused by SCells on any frequency
range. For a UE which supports per-FR gaps, interruptions to PCell,
PSCell and activated SCell may be caused by SCells on the same frequency
range as the victim cell.

#### 8.2.4.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.4.2.1 Interruptions at PSCell/SCell addition/release

When PSCell or one or more SCells is added or released using the same
*RRCConnectionReconfiguration* message as defined in TS 38.331 \[2\],
the UE is allowed an interruption on any activated serving cell during
the RRC reconfiguration procedure as follows:

\- an interruption on any active serving cell:

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.1-1, if the active
serving cell is not in the same band as the SCell being added or
released, or

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.1-2, if the active
serving cells are in the same band as the SCell being added or released,
provided the cell specific reference signals from the active serving
cells and the SCell being added or released are available in the same
slot.

##### 8.2.4.2.2 Interruptions at SCell activation/deactivation

When a SCell is activated or deactivated as defined in TS 37.340 \[17\],
the UE is allowed

\- an interruption on any active serving cell:

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.2-1, if the active
serving cell is not in the same band as the SCell being activated or
deactivated, or

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.2-2, if the active
serving cells are in the same band as the SCell being activated or
deactivated provided the cell specific reference signals from the active
serving cells and the SCell being activated or deactivated are available
in the same slot.

The requirements in this clause shall apply when a supplementary UL
carrier or an UL carrier is configured or de-configured in NR-DC as
defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

When an UL carrier or supplementary UL carrier is configured or
de-configured, an interruption of up to the duration shown in table
8.2.4.2.4-1, is allowed during the RRC reconfiguration procedure in
TS 38.331 \[2\] on all the other activated serving cells within the same
FR as the reconfigured uplink carrier. The interruption is for both
uplink and downlink of all the other serving cells within the same FR as
the configured or de-configured UL.

-------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall
be able to activate a deactivated SCell and deactivate an activated
SCell in EN-DC, or in standalone NR carrier aggregation, or in NE-DC, or
in NR-DC.

The requirements shall apply for EN-DC, standalone NR carrier
aggregation, NE-DC, and NR-DC.

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
one downlink SCell in EN-DC, or in standalone NR carrier aggregation or
in NE-DC or in NR-DC and when one SCell is being activated.

The delay within which the UE shall be able to activate the deactivated
SCell depends upon the specified conditions.

Upon receiving SCell activation command in slot *n*, the UE shall be
capable to transmit valid CSI report and apply actions related to the
activation command for the SCell being activated no later than in slot
$n + \frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + T_{activation\_ time} + T_{CSI\_ Reporting}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$

> the condition defined in clause 3.6.3, and
>
> \- The parameter *ssb-PositionsInBurst* is same for the serving
> cell(s) and the Scell, and
>
> \- SSB is in the same half-frame on the SCell and the FR2 active

\- the RS (s) of SCell being activated is (are) QCL-TypeD with RS (s) of
one active serving cell on that FR2 band.

semi-persistent CSI-RS activation command and TCI state activation
command at the same time.

T~FirstSSB\_MAX~: Is the time to the end of the first complete SSB burst
indicated by the SMTC, or within 5ms if SMTC is not configured, after
slot n + $\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$,
further fulfilling:

SCell in FR1 is known if it has been meeting the following conditions:

> \- During the period equal to max(5\*measCycleSCell,  5\*DRX cycles)
> for FR1 before the reception of the SCell activation command:
>
> \- the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the SCell being

> \- the SSB measured during the period equal to max(5\*measCycleSCell,
> 5\*DRX cycles) also remains detectable during the SCell activation
> delay according to the cell identification conditions specified in
> clause 9.2 and 9.3.

Otherwise SCell in FR1 is unknown.

The requirements for FR1 unknown SCell activation specified in this
clause apply when one of the following conditions is met

\- 'ssb-PositionInBurst' indicates only one SSB is being actually
transmitted, or

\- 'ssb-PositionInBurst' indicates multiple SSBs and TCI indication is
provided in same MAC PDU with SCell activation.

For the first SCell activation in FR2 bands, the SCell is known if it
has been meeting the following conditions:

> \- During the period equal to 4s for UE supporting power class1 and 3s
> for UE supporting power class 2/3/4 before UE receives the last
> activation command for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable) and
> semi-persistent CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable):
>
> \- the UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index,
> and
>
> \- SCell activation command is received after L3-RSRP reporting and no
> later than the time when UE receives MAC-CE command for TCI activation
>
> \- During the period from L3-RSRP reporting to the valid CQI
> reporting, the reported SSBs with indexes remain detectable according
> to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2 and
> 9.3, and the TCI state is selected based on one of the latest reported
> SSB indexes.

Otherwise, the first SCell in FR2 band is unknown. The requirement for
unknown SCell applies provided that the activation commands for PDCCH
TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable), semi-persistent CSI-RS for CQI
reporting (when applicable), and configuration message for TCI of
periodic CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable) are based on the
latest valid L1-RSRP reporting.

If the UE has been provided with higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\]
signaling of *smtc2* prior to the activation command, T~SMTC\_Scell~
follows *smtc1* or *smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the
target cell being activated. T~SMTC\_MAX~ follows *smtc1* or *smtc2*
according to the physical cell IDs of the target cells being activated
and the active serving cells.

In addition to CSI reporting defined above, UE shall also apply other
actions related to the activation command specified in TS 38.331 \[2\]
for a SCell at the first opportunities for the corresponding actions
once the SCell is activated.

The starting point of an interruption window on spCell or any activated
SCell, as specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot
n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$ and not occur
after slot
n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3ms + T_{X}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$,
where NR slot length is with respect to the numerology used in the SCell
being activated, and T~X~ is:

> \- 0, if T~activation\_time~ is 3ms
>
> \- T~FirstSSB~, for any scenario where T~activation\_time~ includes
> T~FirstSSB~;
>
> \- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~, for any scenario where T~activation\_time~
> includes T~FirstSSB\_MAX~;
>
> \- T~uncertainty\_MAC~ +T~FineTiming~, for any scenario where
> T~activation\_time~ includes only T~FineTiming-~ and no
> T~FirstSSB\_MAX.~

The length of the interruption window may be different for different
victim cells, and depends on the applicable scenario and on the
frequency band relation between the aggressor cell and the victim cell.

The requirements in this clause and requriements on interruption due to
SCell activation in clause 8.2 apply provided that the SSB of the
to-be-activated SCell is within the first active DL BWP of the SCell.

Starting from the slot specified in clause 4.3 of TS 38.213 \[3\]
(timing for secondary Cell activation/deactivation) and until the UE has
completed the SCell activation, the UE shall report out of range if the
UE has available uplink resources to report CQI for the SCell.

Starting from the slot specified in clause 4.3 of TS 38.213 \[3\]
(timing for secondary Cell activation/deactivation) and until the UE has
completed a first L1-RSRP measurement, the UE shall report lowest valid
L1 SS-RSRP range if the UE has available uplink resources to report
L1-RSRP for the SCell.

### 8.3.3 SCell Deactivation Delay Requirement for Activated SCell

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
one downlink SCell in EN-DC, or in standalone NR carrier aggregation, or
in NE-DC, or in NR-DC.

Upon receiving SCell deactivation command in slot *n*, the UE shall
accomplish the deactivation actions for the SCell being deactivated no
later than in slot *n
+*$\ \frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$. The
starting point of an interruption window on spCell or any activated
SCell, as specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot
n+1+$\ \frac{T_{\text{HARQ}}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$ and not occur
after slot
n+1+$\ \frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$, where NR
slot length is with respect to the numerology used in the SCell being
deactivated.

Upon expiry of the *sCellDeactivationTimer* in slot *n*, the UE shall
accomplish the deactivation actions for the SCell being deactivated no
later than in slot *n +*$\ \frac{3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$. The
starting point of an interruption window on spCell or any activated
SCell, as specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot n+1 and
not occur after slot n+1+$\ \frac{3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$, where
NR slot length is with respect to the numerology used in the SCell being
deactivated.

The length of the interruption window may be different for different
victim cells, and depends on the applicable scenario and on the
frequency band relation between the aggressor cell and the victim cell.

8.4 UE UL carrier RRC reconfiguration delay
-------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for a UE being configured or
deconfigured with a supplementary UL carrier or NR UL carrier.

### 8.4.2 UE UL carrier configuration delay requirement

When the UE receives a RRC message implying NR UL or supplementary UL
carrier configuration, the UE shall be ready to start transmission on
the newly configured carrier within T~UL\_carrier\_config~ from the end
of the slot n..

Where

\- Slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command.

\- T~UL\_carrier\_config~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay defined
in clause 11.2 in TS 36.331 \[16\] if the corresponding RRC message is
embedded in E-UTRA RRC message, otherwise it equals the maximum RRC
procedure delay defined in clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 8.4.3 UE UL carrier deconfiguration delay requirement

When the UE receives a RRC message implying NR UL or supplementary UL
carrier deconfiguration RRC signalling, the UE shall stop UL signalling
on the deconfigured UL carrier within T~UL\_carrier\_deconfig~ from the
end of the slot n.

Where

\- Slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command.

\- T~UL\_carrier\_deconfig~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay
defined in clause 11.2 in TS 36.331 \[16\] if the corresponding RRC
message is embedded in E-UTRA RRC message, otherwise it equals the
maximum RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\].

8.5 Link Recovery Procedures
----------------------------

### 8.5.1 Introduction

The UE shall assess the downlink radio link quality of a serving cell
based on the reference signal in the set as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\]
in order to detect beam failure on:

> \- PCell in SA, NR-DC, or NE-DC operation mode,
>
> \- PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode.

The RS resource configurations in the set can be periodic CSI-RS
resources and/or SSBs. UE is not required to perform beam failure
detection outside the active DL BWP. UE is not required to meet the
requirements in clause 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 if UE does not have set .

On each RS resource configuration in the set , the UE shall estimate the
radio link quality and compare it to the threshold Q~out\_LR~ for the
purpose of accessing downlink radio link quality of the serving cell
beams.

The threshold Q~out\_LR~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio level link of a given resource configuration on set cannot be
reliably received and shall correspond to the BLER~out~ = 10% block
error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission. For SSB based beam
failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 8.5.2.1-1. For CSI-RS
based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 8.5.3.1-1.

Upon request the UE shall deliver configuration indexes from the set *as
specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] , to higher layers,* and the corresponding
L1-RSRP measurement provided that the measured L1-RSRP is equal to or
better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~, which is indicated by higher layer
parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The UE applies the Q~in\_LR~ threshold to
the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from an SSB. The UE applies the
Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained for a CSI-RS
resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power with a value
provided by higher layer parameter *powerControlOffsetSS*. The RS
resource configurations in the set can be periodic CSI-RS resources or
SSBs or both SSB and CSI-RS resources. UE is not required to perform
candidate beam detection outside the active DL BWP.

### 8.5.2 Requirements for SSB based beam failure detection

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSB configured for beam
failure detection is actually transmitted within the UE active DL BWP
during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.5.2.2.

#### 8.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured SSB resource in set estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ ms period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ ms period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 8.5.2.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 8.5.2.2-2 for FR2
with scaling factor N=8

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB.

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with
SMTC period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{Min(MGRP,\text{\ T}_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
(T~SSB~ \<MGRP) and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially
or fully overlapped with measurement gap.

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside measurement gap
is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

> \- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
> *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
> indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
> symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
> *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, given the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
provided the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
pervious conditions.

#### 8.5.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1, when the SSB OFDM symbols used for BFD measurement fully or
partially overlap with CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the
> SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;
>
> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,
>
> \- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
> able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;
>
> \- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
> is required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD measurement and
> CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD measurement is
> expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for BFD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period
for SSB based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

### 8.5.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection

#### 8.5.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ![](./media/image14.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.21666666666666667in"} of resource configurations for a serving
cell, provided that the CSI-RS resource(s) in set

height="0.21666666666666667in"}for beam failure detection are actually
transmitted within the UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation
period specified in clause 8.5.3.2. UE is not expected to perform beam
failure detection measurements on the CSI-RS configured for BFD if the
CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD when applicable, with the RS in the
active TCI state of any CORESET configured in the UE active BWP.

#### 8.5.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the CSI-RS resource in set estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ ms period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ ms period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table 8.5.3.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table 8.5.3.2-2 for
FR2 with N=1. The requirements of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ apply
provided that the CSI-RS for BFD is not in a resource set configured
with repetition ON. The requirements shall not apply when the CSI-RS
resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS resource
for BFD and the TCI state information of the CSI-RS resource is not
given, wherein the TCI state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for
L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS.

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P = 1, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement
gap and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when the BFD-RS
resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap and the BFD-RS
resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5 ×
T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{Min(MGRP,\ T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
(T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP) and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is
partially or fully overlapped with measurement gap.

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped
with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

> Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for BFD and SMTC means that CSI-RS
> for BFD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
BFD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet pervious conditions.

The values of M~BFD~ used in Table 8.5.3.2-1 and Table 8.5.3.2-2 are
defined as

> \- M~BFD~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource(s) in set

> height="0.21666666666666667in"} used for BFD is transmitted with

#### 8.5.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for BFD measurement in the PRBs that overlap
with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement, the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement,
the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions
according to its capabilities:

> \- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
> shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.
>
> \- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*,
> UE is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD
> measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD
> measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC or
different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for BFD measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS
based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

> \- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not
> both CSI-RS for BFD measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer
> measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is expected, and
> no requirements are defined.
>
> \- The CSI-RS for BFD measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource
> set configured with repetition ON, or
>
> \- The other CSI-RS is configured in set
> ![](./media/image15.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
> height="0.21875in"} and beam failure is detected, or
>
> \- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
> information is not known to UE,
>
> \- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD
> measurement without any restriction.

### 8.5.4 Minimum requirement for L1 indication

When the radio link quality on all the RS resources in set is worse than
Q~out\_LR~, layer 1 of the UE shall send a beam failure instance
indication to the higher layers.

The beam failure instance evaluation for the RS resources in set shall
be performed as specified in clause 6 in TS 38.213 \[3\]. Two successive
indications from layer 1 shall be separated by at least
T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~.

When DRX is not used, T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ is max(2ms,
T~SSB-RS,M~) ) or max(2ms, T~CSI-RS,M~), where T~SSB-RS,M~ and
T~CSI-RS,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all RS resources in set for
the accessed cell, corresponding to either the shortest periodicity of
the SSB in the set or CSI-RS resource in the set .

When DRX is used, for SSB based link quality measurement,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = Max(1.5 × DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 ×
T~SSB-RS,M~), if DRX\_cycle\_length ≤ 320ms,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = DRX\_cycle\_length, if
DRX\_cycle\_length \> 320ms.

When DRX is used, for CSI-RS based link quality measurement,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = Max(1.5 × DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 ×
T~CSI-RS,M~), if DRX\_cycle\_length ≤ 320ms,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = DRX\_cycle\_length, if
DRX\_cycle\_length \> 320ms.

### 8.5.5 Requirements for SSB based candidate beam detection

#### 8.5.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
![](./media/image15.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} configured for a serving cell, provided that the
SSBs configured for candidate beam detection are actually transmitted
within UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in
clause 8.5.5.2.

#### 8.5.5.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured SSB resource in set
![](./media/image15.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ ms
period becomes better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~ provided SSB\_RP and
SSB Ês/Iot are according to Annex Table B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

The UE shall monitor the configured SSB resources using the evaluation
period in table 8.5.5.2-1 and 8.5.5.2-2 corresponding to the non-DRX
mode, if the configured DRX cycle ≤ 320ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 8.5.5.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 8.5.5.2-2 for FR2
with scaling factor N=8.

where,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB,

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with measurement gap
and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully
overlapped with SMTC period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ =
0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{Min(MGRP,T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is
partially or fully overlapped with measurement gap

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially
overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the candidate beam detection RS outside
measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by SSB-ToMeasure and 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
SSB-ToMeasure and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by SSB-ToMeasure, given that SSB-ToMeasure is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by ss-RSSI-Measurement
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
ss-RSSI-Measurement and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by ss-RSSI-Measurement, given that ss-RSSI-Measurement is configured

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*
T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the same FR2
band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet pervious conditions.

#### 8.5.5.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based candidate beam detection

For FR1, when the SSB OFDM symbols used for CBD measurement fully or
partially overlap with CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for CBD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period
for SSB based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

### 8.5.6 Requirements for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

#### 8.5.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ![](./media/image15.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} configured for a serving cell, provided that the
CSI-RS resources configured for candidate beam detection are actually
transmitted within UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period
specified in clause 8.5.6.2.

#### 8.5.6.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured CSI-RS resource in set
![](./media/image15.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~
\[ms\] period becomes better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~ within
T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ \[ms\] period provided CSI-RS Ês/Iot is
according to Annex Table B.2.4.2 for a corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured CSI-RS resources using the
evaluation period in table 8.5.6.2-1 and 8.5.6.2-2 corresponding to the
non-DRX mode, if the configured DRX cycle ≤ 320ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table 8.5.6.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table 8.5.6.2-2 for
FR2 with scaling factor N=8.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P = 1, when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with
measurement gap and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when candidate
beam detection RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and
candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with measurement gap and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ =
0.5 × T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{Min(MGRP,\ T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is
partially or fully overlapped with measurement gap

\- $P = \frac{3}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when candidate
beam detection RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and
candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped
with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the candidate beam detection RS outside
measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1*.
T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the same FR2
band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for CBD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
CBD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet pervious conditions.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the CSI-RS is on the same
OFDM symbols with RLM, BFD, BM-RS, or other CBD-RS, according to the
measurement restrictions defined in clause 8.5.6.3.

The values of M~CBD~ used in Table 8.5.6.2-1 and Table 8.5.6.2-2 are
defined as

> \- M~CBD~ = 3, if the CSI-RS resource configured in the set
> ![](./media/image15.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
> height="0.21875in"} is transmitted with Density = 3 and over the

#### 8.5.6.3 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for CBD measurement in the PRBs that overlap
with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for CBD measurement, the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement without
restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for CBD measurement,
the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

> \- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
> shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement for without
> restrictions.
>
> \- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*,
> UE is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD
> measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based CBD
> measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for CBD measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of
but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and SSB. Longer evaluation
period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and the other
CSI-RS. Longer evaluation period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5.7 Scheduling availability of UE during beam failure detection

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing beam
failure detection are described in the following clauses.

#### 8.5.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to beam failure detection
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured for BFD with the same SCS as
PDSCH or PDCCH in FR1.

#### 8.5.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to beam failure
detection when SSB is configured as BFD. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to beam failure detection when SSB is configured as BFD.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols
> to be measured for beam failure detection.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell apply to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with
restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is
configured, there are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s)
configured in other bands than the bands in which PCell or PSCell is
configured.

#### 8.5.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to beam failure
detection.

> \- For the case where no RSs are provided for BFD, or when CSI-RS is
> configured for BFD is explicitly configured and is type-D QCLed with
> active TCI state for PDCCH or PDSCH, and the CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS
> resource set with repetition ON
>
> \- There are no scheduling restrictions due to beam failure detection
> performed based on the CSI-RS.
>
> \- Otherwise
>
> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on BFD-RS

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on FR2 serving PCell or PSCell apply to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with
restricted symbols.

For FR2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
is expected to receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for BFD
mesurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
is expected to receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for
BFD mesurement.

#### 8.5.7.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA and NR DC

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to beam
failure detection performed on FR2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

measurement for candidate beam detection are described in the following
clauses.

#### 8.5.8.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as link recovery detection
resource with the same SCS as PDSCH or PDCCH in FR1.

#### 8.5.8.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as link recovery detection resource. For UEs
which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the
following restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB
configured as link recovery detection resource.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH, TRS, CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB
> symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on one serving cell apply to all other serving cells in the
same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the
restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is
configured, there are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s)
configured in other bands.

#### 8.5.8.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to candidate beam
detection

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH, CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on reference
> symbols to be measured for candidate beam detection.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on to one serving cell apply to all serving cells in the
same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with restricted
symbols.

For FR2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
is expected to receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for CBD
mesurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
is expected to receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for
CBD mesurement.

#### 8.5.8.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA and NR-DC

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR2 serving cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR1 serving cell(s).

NR-DC in Rel-15 only includes the scenarios where all serving cells in
MCG are in FR1 and all serving cells in SCG are in FR2.

### 8.5.9 Minimum requirement at transitions for beam failure detection

When the UE transitions between DRX and no DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, for each BFD-RS resource, for a duration of time
equal to the evaluation period corresponding to the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first
mode and the second mode. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use
an evaluation period corresponding to the second mode for each BFD-RS
resource.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of BFD resources to a
second configuration of BFD resources that is different from the first
configuration, for each BFD resource present in the second
configuration, for a duration of time equal to the evaluation period
corresponding to the second configuration after the transition occurs,
the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no less than the minimum
of evaluation periods corresponding to the first configuration and the
second configuration. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second configuration for each BFD
resource present in the second configuration.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of active TCI state
of the CORESET to a second configuration of active TCI state of the
CORESET, for each CSI-RS for BFD present in the second configuration,
the UE shall use an evaluation period corresponding to the second
configuration from the time of transition.

8.6 Active BWP switch delay
---------------------------

### 8.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for a UE configured PCell or any
activated SCell in standalone NR or NE-DC, PCell, PSCell or any
activated SCell in MCG or SCG in NR-DC, or PSCell or any activated SCell
in SCG in EN-DC. UE shall complete the switch of active DL and/or UL BWP
within the delay defined in this clause.

### 8.6.2 DCI and timer based BWP switch delay

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on a single CC with more than one BWP configurations
configured.

For DCI based BWP switch, if the serving cell where UE receives DCI for
BWP switch request is different from the serving cell on which BWP
switch occurs, the UE is not required to follow the requirements
specified in this clause.

For DCI-based BWP switch, after the UE receives BWP switching request at
DL slot n on a serving cell, UE shall be able to receive PDSCH (for DL
active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the
new BWP on the serving cell on which BWP switch on the first DL or UL
slot occurs right after a time duration of T~BWPswitchDelay~ which
starts from the beginning of DL slot n.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
until the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration of
T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n except
DCI triggering BWP switch on the cell where DCI-based BWP switch occurs.
The UE is not required to follow the requirements defined in this clause
when performing a DCI-based BWP switch between the BWPs in disjoint
channel bandwidths or in partially overlapping channel bandwidths.

For timer-based BWP switch, the UE shall start BWP switch at DL slot n,
where slot n is the first slot of a DL subframe (FR1) or DL
half-subframe (FR2) immediately after a BWP-inactivity timer
*bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expires on a serving cell, and the UE shall
be able to receive PDSCH (for DL active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH
(for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving cell on which
BWP switch on the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration
of T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ after *bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\]
expires on the cell where timer-based BWP switch occurs.

Depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\], UE shall finish
BWP switch within the time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ defined in Table
8.6.2-1.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Provided the UE does not have the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-states
before the BWP switch until a new MAC CE updating the required TCI-state
information for PDCCH and PDSCH is received after the BWP switch.

If UE has the information on the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP,

> \- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with old TCI-states
> before the delay as specified in Clause 8.10 in the new BWP.
>
> \- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with new TCI-states
> after the delay as specified in Clause 8.10 in the new BWP

### 8.6.3 RRC based BWP switch delay

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on a single CC with one or more than one BWP
configuration(s) configured, with

-   Active BWP switch or parameter change of its active BWPs for SpCell

-   Parameter change of its active BWPs except parameter
    > *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* and *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* for
    > SCell

For RRC-based BWP switch, after the UE receives RRC reconfiguration
involving active BWP switching or parameter change of its active BWP, UE
shall be able to receive PDSCH/PDCCH (for DL active BWP switch) or
transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving
cell on which BWP switch occurs on the first DL or UL slot right after a
time duration of
$\frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
slots which begins from the beginning of DL slot n, where

DL slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command, and

$\text{NR\ Slot\ length}$ is determined by the smaller SCS between the
SCS before BWP switch and the SCS after BWP switch if the BWP switch
involves changing of SCS.

$T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ is the length of the RRC processing
delay in ms as defined in Table 11.2-1 in clause 11.2 in TS 36.331
\[16\] if the corresponding RRC message is embedded in E-UTRA RRC
message, otherwise it is the length of the RRC processing delay in ms as
defined in Table 12.1-1 in clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\], and

$T_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}} = 6ms$ is the time used by the UE to
perform BWP switch.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during the time defined by
${T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}$ on the
cell where RRC-based BWP switch occurs. When
${T_{\text{HARQ}} > \ T}_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ a longer switching
delay is allowed. Where $T_{\text{HARQ}}$ is the time between DL data
transmission and acknowledgement as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\].

8.8 NE-DC: E-UTRAN PSCell Addition and Release Delay
----------------------------------------------------

### 8.8.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall
be able to configure an E-UTRAN PSCell in NR - E-UTRA dual connectivity.
The requirements are applicable to an NR - E-UTRA dual connectivity
capable UE.

### 8.8.2 E-UTRAN PSCell Addition Delay Requirement

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE, which is
configured with PCell, and may also be configured with one or more
SCells.

Upon receiving E-UTRAN PSCell addition in subframe *n*, the UE shall be
capable to transmit PRACH preamble towards E-UTRAN PSCell no later than
in subframe *n* + T~config\_EUTRAN-PSCell~:

Where:

> T~config\_EUTRAN-PSCell~ = T~RRC\_delay~ + T~activation\_time~ + 50ms
> + T~E-UTRAN-PSCell\_\ DU~
>
> T~RRC\_delay~ is the RRC procedure delay as specified in TS 38.331
> \[2\].
>
> T~activation\_time~ is the E-UTRAN PSCell activation delay. If the
> E-UTRAN PSCell is known, then T~activation\_time~ is 20ms. If the
> E-UTRAN PSCell is unknown, then T~activation\_time~ is 30ms provided
> the E-UTRAN PSCell can be successfully detected on the first attempt.
>
> T~E-UTRAN-PSCell\_DU~ is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first
> available PRACH occasion in the E-UTRAN PSCell. T~E-UTRAN-PSCell\_DU~
> is up to 30ms.

E-UTRAN PSCell is known if it has been meeting the following conditions:

\- During the last 5 seconds before the reception of the E-UTRAN PSCell
configuration command:

\- the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the E-UTRAN PSCell
being configured and

\- the E-UTRAN PSCell being configured remains detectable according to
the cell identification conditions specified in clause 8.8 of
TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- E-UTRAN PSCell being configured also remains detectable during the
E-UTRAN PSCell configuration delay T~config\_EUTRAN-PSCell~ according to
the cell identification conditions specified in clause 8.8 of
TS 36.133 \[15\].

otherwise it is unknown.

The PCell interruption specified in clause 8.2 is allowed only during
the RRC reconfiguration procedure \[2\].

### 8.8.3 E-UTRAN PSCell Release Delay Requirement

The requirements in this clause shall apply for a UE which is configured

In E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity mode,

\- if per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

In NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity mode,

\- if per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms and UE has NR serving cell in FR1, the measurement
gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the end of the latest NR
subframe occurring immediately before the configured measurement gap
among MCG serving cells subframes in FR1.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms and UE doesn't have NR serving cell in FR1, the
measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the end of
the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately before the configured
measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

In NR-NR dual connectivity mode,

\- If per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest MCG subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- If per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest MCG subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- If per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest SCG subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

T~MG~ is the MG timing advance value provided in *mgta* according to
TS38.331 \[2\].

In determining the measurement gap starting point, UE shall use the DL
timing of the latest E-UTRA or NR subframe occurring immediately before
the configured measurement gap among E-UTRA or NR serving cells.

*NR-DC in Rel-15 only includes the scenarios where all serving cells in
MCG in FR1 and all serving cells in SCG in FR2.*

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE configured with E-UTRA-NR dual
connectivity or NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity, when serving cells are in
E-UTRA and FR1, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2,

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
the measurement gap pattern configured by MN;

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to only
LTE/FR1 serving cell(s),

> \- UE fulfils the measurement requirements for FR1/LTE measurement
> objects based on the configured measurement gap pattern;
>
> \- UE fulfils the requirements for FR2 measurement objects based on
> effective MGRP=20ms;

For per-FR measurement gap capable configured with E-UTRA-NR dual
connectivity, NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity or NR-NR dual connectivity,
when serving cells are in E-UTRA, FR1 and FR2, or in E-UTRA and FR2, or
in FR1 and FR2, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA /FR1 and FR2,

> \- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
> E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
> requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
> the measurement gap pattern configured by MN.

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE in NR standalone operation (with
single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC configuration), for per-FR gap based
measurement, when there is no serving cell in a particular FR, where
measurement objects are configured, regardless if explicit per-FR
measurement gap is configured in this FR, the effective MGRP in this FR
is used to determine requirements;

\- 20 ms for FR2 NR measurements

\- 40 ms for FR1 NR measurements

\- 40 ms for LTE measurements

\- 40 ms for FR1+LTE measurements

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE in NR standalone operation (with
single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC configuration), when serving cells are
in FR1 or FR2, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA /FR1 and FR2,

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
the measurement gap pattern configured by MN;

If measurement gap is configured in one FR but measurement object is not
configured in the FR, the scheduling opportunity in the FR depends on
the configured measurement gap pattern.

For E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity, if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap,
total interruption time on SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) =
6ms, 4ms and 3ms. And if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on FR1 serving cells in SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N)
= 6ms, 4ms and 3ms, and total interruption time on FR2 serving cells in
SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 5.5ms, 3.5ms and 1.5ms.

For NR standalone operation (with single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC
configuration), if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on a serving cell during MGL is defined when MGL(N) = 6ms, 5.5ms,
4ms, 3.5ms, 3ms, and 1.5ms. And if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total
interruption time on FR1 serving cells during MGL is defined only when
MGL(N) = 6ms, 4ms and 3ms, and total interruption time on FR2 serving
cells during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 5.5ms, 3.5ms and 1.5ms.

For NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity, if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap,
total interruption time on MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) =
6ms, 4ms and 3ms. And if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on FR1 serving cells in MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N)
= 6ms, 4ms and 3ms, and total interruption time on FR2 serving cells in
MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 5.5ms, 3.5ms and 1.5ms.

> \(b\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0.5ms

\(c\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0ms for
asynchronous EN-DC and asynchronous NE-DC

\(d\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0.5ms
for asynchronous EN-DC and asynchronous NE-DC

cells for EN-DC, NR standalone operation (with single carrier, NR CA and
NR-DC configuration) and NE-DC

The corresponding total number of interrupted slots on serving cells is
listed in Table 9.1.2-4 for synchronous EN-DC, NR standalone and NE-DC,
and in Table 9.1.2-4a for asynchronous EN-DC respectively.

transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when MGTA is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect
to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots
occurring immediately after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than
15kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15kHz, in the L
consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with the
same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after the slot
partially overlapped with measurement gap

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

Note: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

For UE configured with the EN-DC operation, the effective total number
of frequencies excluding the frequencies of the PSCell, SCells, E-UTRA
PCell, and E-UTRA SCells being monitored is N~freq,\ EN-DC~, which is

### 9.1.4 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria

#### 9.1.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in clause 9.1.4.2,
the UE shall meet all other performance requirements defined in clause 9
and clause 10.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Each measurement identity
corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic reporting, or no
reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each measurement identity
is associated with an event triggering criterion. In case of periodic
reporting, a measurement identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.

#### 9.1.4.2 Requirements {#requirements-12 .list-paragraph}

In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in
the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion
(in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case
of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of event,
with the same or different event identities, is counted as separate
reporting criterion in Table 9.1.4.2-1.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to Table 9.1.4.2-1. For the measurement
categories belonging to intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT
measurements (i.e. without counting other categories that the UE shall
always support in parallel), the UE need not support more than the total
number of reporting criteria as follows:

\- For UE configured with EN-DC:
$E_{\text{cat},\text{EN} - \text{DC},\text{NR}} + E_{\text{cat},\text{EN} - \text{DC},E - \text{UTRA}}$,
where

$E_{cat,EN - DC,NR} = 10 + 9 \times n$ is the total number of NR
reporting criteria configured by PSCell (NR intra- and inter-frequency
reporting criteria) and by E-UTRA PCell on NR serving frequencies (NR
intra-frequency reporting criteria) applicable for UE configured with
EN-DC according to Table 9.1.4.2-1, and n is the number of configured NR
serving frequencies, including PSCell and SCells carrier frequencies,

$E_{cat,EN - DC,E - \text{UTRA}}$ is the total number of reporting
criteria configured by E-UTRA PCell except PSCell and SCells carrier
frequencies, as specified in TS 36.133 \[15\] for UE configured with
EN-DC.

\- For UE configured with
NE-DC:$\ E_{\text{cat},\text{NE} - \text{DC},\text{NR}} + E_{\text{cat},\text{NE} - \text{DC},E - \text{UTRA}}$,
where

$E_{cat,NE - DC,NR} = 10 + 9 \times n$ is the total number of NR
reporting criteria according to Table 9.1.4.2-1, and n is the number of
configured NR serving frequencies, including PCell, and SCells carrier
frequencies,

$E_{cat,NE - DC,E - \text{UTRA}} = E_{cat,NE - DC,E - UTRA,inter - \text{RAT}} + E_{cat,NE - DC,E - UTRA,intra - \text{RAT}}$,
where

$E_{cat,NE - DC,E - UTRA,inter - \text{RAT}}$ is the total number of
inter-RAT E-UTRA reporting criteria configured by PCell except E-UTRA
PSCell and E-UTRA SCells carrier frequencies, according to Table
9.1.4.2-1,

$E_{cat,NE - DC,E - UTRA,intra - \text{RAT}}$ is the total number of
E-UTRA reporting criteria including E-UTRA PSCell and E-UTRA SCells
carrier frequencies as specified in TS 36.133 \[15\] for UE configured
with NE-DC.

\- For UE configured with SA operation mode: , where

is the total number of NR reporting criteria according to Table
9.1.4.2-1, and n is the number of configured NR serving frequencies,
including PCell, and SCells carrier frequencies,

is the total number of inter-RAT E-UTRA reporting criteria according to
Table 9.1.4.2-1.

\- For UE configured with NR-DC:
$E_{\text{cat},\text{NR} - \text{DC},\text{NR}} + E_{\text{cat},\text{NR} - \text{DC},E - \text{UTRA}}$,
where

$E_{cat,NR - DC,NR} = 10 + 9 \times n$ is the total number of NR
reporting criteria according to Table 9.1.4.2-1, and n is the number of
configured NR serving frequencies, including PCell, PSCell and SCells
carrier frequencies,

$E_{cat,NR - DC,E - \text{UTRA}}$ is the total number of inter-RAT
E-UTRA reporting criteria according to Table 9.1.4.2-1.

### 9.1.5 Carrier-specific scaling factor

This clause specifies the derivation of carrier-specific scaling factor
(CSSF) values, which scales the measurement delay requirements given in
clause 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 when UE is configured to monitor multiple
measurement objects. The CSSF values are categorized into
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ and CSSF~within\_gap,i~, for the measurements
conducted outside measurement gaps and within measurement gaps,
respectively.

#### 9.1.5.1 Monitoring of multiple layers outside gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for measurement
object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following measurement
types:*

\- Intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in clause 9.2.5,
when none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- Intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in clause 9.2.5,
when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

> \- For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, NR inter-RAT
> measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN PCell on an NR serving
> carrier

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- none or part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-RAT measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap;

UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object *i*
only outside the measurement gaps.

For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, if a measurement
object configured by PSCell and an NR inter-RAT measurment object
configured by E-UTRAN PCell are on the same serving carrier, they shall
be counted as one intra-frequency measurement object, provided that they
meet the measurement object merging conditions \[in clause 9.1.3.2\].

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

The UE cell identification and measurement periods derived based on
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clauses 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2 may be extended for
measurement objects of which the cell identification and measurement
periods are overlapped with T~measure\_SFTD1~ specified in clause 9.3.8
when no measurement gaps are provided.

The requirements in this clause apply provided that

\- The SMTC on all CCs in FR2 have the same offset, and one of following
conditions is met

\- If *smtc2* is configured on any FR2 CC,

\- All CCs have the same configuration for *smtc1*, and

\- All CCs configured with *smtc2* have the same configuration for
*smtc2*

\- If *smtc2* is not configured on any FR2 CC,

\- The total number of different SMTC periodicities on all serving CCs
does not exceed 4

Note: Longer delays for cell identification and measurement periods
derived based on CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clauses 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2, can
be expected, if the UE is configured with more than 4 different SMTC
periodicities on FR2 serving carriers. The longer delay applies for the
FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects with the longest SMTC
periodicity/periodicities.

##### 9.1.5.1.1 EN-DC mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based measurements performed outside gaps

For UE configured with the E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, the
carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for intra-frequency
SSB-based measurements performed outside measurements gaps will be as
specified in Table 9.1.5.1.1-1.

#### 9.1.5.2 Monitoring of multiple layers within gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for measurement
object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following measurement
types:*

\- Intra-frequency measurement object with no measurement gap in clause
9.2.5, when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- Intra-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in clause
9.2.6.

\- Inter-frequency measurement object in clause 9.3.

\- E-UTRA Inter-RAT measurement object in clauses 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

\- E-UTRA Inter-RAT RSTD and E-CID measurements in clauses 9.4.4 and
9.4.5.

\- For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, NR Inter-RAT
measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN PCell (TS 36.133 \[15\]
clause 8.17.4) on an NR serving carrier

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-RAT measurement object are
overlapped by the measurement gap;

\- NR Inter-RAT measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN PCell (TS
36.133 \[15\] clause 8.17.4) on an NR non-serving carrier.

\- E-UTRAN Inter-frequency measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN
PCell (TS 36.133 \[15\] clause 8.17.3) and by the E-UTRAN PSCell (TS
36.133 \[15\] clause 8.19.3).

\- E-UTRAN Inter-frequency RSTD measurement configured by the E-UTRAN
PCell (TS 36.133 \[15\] clause 8.17.15).

\- UTRA Inter-RAT measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN PCell (TS
36.133 \[15\] clauses 8.17.5 to 8.17.12).

\- GSM Inter-RAT measurements configured by the E-UTRAN PCell (TS 36.133
\[15\] clauses 8.17.13 and 8.17.14).

UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object *i*
only within the measurement gaps.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

##### 9.1.5.2.1 EN-DC mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based measurements performed within gaps

The scaling value CSSF~within\_gap,i~ below has been derived without
considering GSM inter-RAT carriers.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as the total number of measurement objects in the same FR as
measurement object *i*.

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, if a measurement
object configured by PSCell and an NR inter-RAT measurement object
configured by E-UTRAN PCell are on the same carrier, they shall be
counted as one measurement object in M~tot,i,j~, provided that they meet
the measurement object merging conditions \[in clause 9.1.3.2\].

If measurement object *i* refers to an RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is
configured, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~
for other measurement objects (including RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs=160ms) participate in the gap competition are derived
as below.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
count the total number of intrafrequency measurement objects and
interfrequency/interRAT measurement objects which are candidates to be
measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object is a candidate to be measured in a gap if
its SMTC duration is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching
time. For intra-frequency NR carriers, if the higher layer in TS 38.331
\[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of
SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; otherwise the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds
to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*

\- An inter-RAT UTRA measurement object configured by E-UTRA PCell
\[15\] is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- An inter-frequency E-UTRA measurement object configured by E-UTRA
PCell \[15\] is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency measurement objects or NR
inter-RAT measurement objects configured by E-UTRA PCell, EUTRA
inter-frequency measurement objects configured by E-UTRA PCell, UTRA
inter-RAT measurement objects configured by E-UTRA PCell which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~inter,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects which
are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object
*i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurement
object, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~ ≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

Where R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the number of
measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate and not used
for RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity
Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary
1280ms period.

Note: In this release of specification, longer delays for cell
identification and measurement periods derived based on
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ can be expected, if the UE is configured with
inter-RAT MO on NR serving CC by E-UTRAN PCell in EN-DC mode.

##### 9.1.5.2.2 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as the total number of measurement objects in the same FR as
measurement object *i*.

If measurement object *i* refers to an RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is
configured, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the the
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for other measurement objects (including RSTD
measurement with periodicity Tprs=160ms) participate in the gap
competition and the CSSF~within\_gap,i~ are derived as below.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
count the total number of intrafrequency measurement objects and
interfrequency/interRAT measurement objects which are candidates to be
measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object is a candidate to be measured in a gap if
its SMTC duration is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching
time. For intra-frequency NR measurement objects, if the higher layer in
TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured, the assumed
periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; otherwise the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- An inter-RAT measurement object is a candidate to be measured in all
meausrement gaps.

\- An inter-frequency SFTD measurement object, if to be measured with
measurement gaps, is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency and EUTRA inter-RAT
measurement objects which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where
the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~inter,i,j~
equals 0.

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects which
are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object
*i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

\- If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurement
object, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~ ≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- Where R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap
where measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the
number of measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate
and not used for RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with
periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an
arbitrary 1280ms period.

CSSF~within\_gap,k~=1 during T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ specified in
clause 9.4.4.1.2.2 and T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ specified in clause
9.4.4.2.2.2, where k is the carrier frequency where the UE is performing
cell detection of the inter-RAT E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference
cell when acquiring the subframe and slot timing of the cell according
to clause 9.4.4. In this case, the UE cell identification and
measurement periods derived based on CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clauses
9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2, 9.2.6.2, 9.2.6.3, 9.3.4, 9.3.5, 9.4.2.2, and 9.4.2.3
may be extended for measurement objects of which the cell identification
and measurement periods are overlapped with T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ and
T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~.

##### 9.1.5.2.3 NE-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

*prs-MutingInfo-r9 is configured* within an arbitrary 160ms period,
count the total number of intrafrequency measurement objects and
interfrequency/interRAT measurement objects which are candidates to be
measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object is a candidate to be measured in a gap if
its SMTC duration is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching

max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an
arbitrary 1280ms period.

##### 9.1.5.2.4 NR-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as the total number of measurement objects in the same FR as
measurement object *i*.

If measurement object *i* refers to an RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is
configured, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~
for other measurement objects (including RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs=160ms) participate in the gap competition and the
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ are derived as below.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
count the total number of intra-frequency measurement objects and
inter-frequency/interRAT measurement objects which are candidates to be
measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object is a candidate to be measured in a gap if
its SMTC duration is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching
time. For intra-frequency NR measurement objects, if the higher layer in
TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured, the assumed
periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; otherwise the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- An inter-RAT measurement object is a candidate to be measured in all
measurement gaps.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the counting
is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured with per UE
gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

If the number of configured inter-frequency and inter-RAT measuerement
objects is non-zero and the UE is configured with per UE gaps, or if the
UE is configured with per FR gaps:

FR1 and FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects belong to group A

Inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects belong to group B

M~groupA,i,j~: Sum of the number of FR1 intra-frequency measurement
objects M~intra-FR1,i,j~ and the number of FR2 intra-frequency
measurement objects M~intra-FR2,i,j~ which are candidates to be measured
in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate.
Otherwise M~groupA,i,j~ equals 0.

M~groupBi,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency and EUTRA inter-RAT
measurement objects which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where
the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupB,i,j~
equals 0.

If the number of configured inter-frequency and inter-RAT measuerement
objects is zero and the UE is configured with per UE gaps:

FR1 intra-frequency measurement objects belong to group A

FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects belong to group B

M~groupA,i,j~: The number of FR1 intra-frequency measurement objects
M~intra-FR1,i,j~ which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where
the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupA,i,j~
equals 0.

M~groupBi,j~ : The number of FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects
M~intra-FR2,i,j~ which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where
the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupB,i,j~
equals 0.

M~tot,i,j~ = M~groupA,i,j~ + M~groupB,i,j~ : Total number of group A and
group B measurement objects which are candidates to be measured in gap
*j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise
M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

> If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
> max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is a group A measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~groupA,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupB,i,j~≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~groupA,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupB,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an group B measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~groupBi,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~ ≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~groupB,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the number of
measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate and not used
for RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity
Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary
1280ms period.

### 9.1.6 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within gaps or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

The carrier-specific scaling factor specified in clause 9.1.5 that
applies to the other impacted measurement objects will also apply based
on the longer measurement or cell identification delay before or after
the transition.

When the UE transitions between DRX and non-DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements apply based on the longer delay before or after the
transition.

Subsequent to this measurement period, the cell identification and
measurement period requirements on each measurement object are
corresponding to the second mode after transition.

9.2 NR intra-frequency measurements
-----------------------------------

### 9.2.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or the
PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP\[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ which start earlier than the gap starting time
+ switching time, nor detect SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which end
later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching time is 0.5ms for
frequency range FR1 and 0.25ms for frequency range FR2.

### 9.2.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2 apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2 and 10.1.3
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7 and 10.1.8
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12 and 10.1.13
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
Band.

### 9.2.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell (except for the
SCell) is not smaller than the number of configured RLM-RS SSB
resources.

#### 9.2.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For one single intra-frequency layer in a band, during each layer 1
measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP,
SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 6 identified cells, and

\- 24 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI,

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC when UE is configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the
band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with EN-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with NR-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- One of the SCCs on which UE is configured to report SSB based
measurements when neither PCC nor PSCC is in the same band, so that the
selected SCC shall be an SCC where the UE is configured with SS-RSRP
measurement reporting if such SCC exists, otherwise the selected SCC is
determined by UE implementation.

The UE shall also be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least 2 SSBs on serving cell for each of the other
intra-frequency layer(s) in the same band.

### 9.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodic
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.2.1
(RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for FR1),
10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1
(RS-SINR for FR2).

#### 9.2.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1
(RSRQ for FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and
10.1.13.1 (RS-SINR for FR2).

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2.4.3.

#### 9.2.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for
FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1
(RS-SINR for FR2).

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ intra\ with\ index~ or T
~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause
9.2.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period T
~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T ~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2. If a cell which has been
detectable at least for the time period T
~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ or T ~identify\ intra\ with\ index~
defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2 becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again with the
same spatial reception parameter and triggers an event, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ Tc while the measurement gap has
not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the
SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3
filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.2.5 Intrafrequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2.5.1 Intrafrequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~. The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It is assumed
that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2.5.1-1, 9.2.5.1-2, 9.2.5.1-4 (CC with deactivated
SCell) or 9.2.5.1-5 (CC with deactivated SCell)

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2.5.1-3 or 9.2.5.1-6
(CC with deactivated SCell)

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.2.5.2-1, table 9.2.5.2-2 table
9.2.5.2-3 (CC with deactivated SCell) or 9.2.5.2-4(CC with deactivated
SCell)

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully non overlapping or partially overlapping with measurement gaps, or
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

if the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise
the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions corresponds to
the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ : For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~=40. For a UE supporting power class 2,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2 power class 3,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2 power class 4,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ =24

M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ : For a UE supporting power class 1,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =40. For a UE supporting FR2 power class 2,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 3,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 4,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24.

When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, Kp=1

When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, Kp = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. For
calculation of Kp, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\]) of
*smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List* parameter
in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC periodicity
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1.*

If the higher layer signaling in TS38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2
is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~

For FR2,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and *SS-RSSI-Measurement* are
configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by the union set
of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on the
same serving carrier which can be merged and RSSI symbols are indicated
by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

> If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
> measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
> delay would be expected.

If MCG DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in Table 9.2.5.1-1,
Table 9.2.5.1-2, Table 9.2.5.1-3, Table 9.2.5.1-4, Table 9.2.5.1-5 and
Table 9.2.5.1-6 shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use,

If MCG DRX is in use, measurement period requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in Table 9.2.5.2-1, Table
9.2.5.2-2, Table 9.2.5.2-3 and Table 9.2.5.2-4 shall depend on the MCG

apply.

For FR2, a longer measurement period is allowed, if aperiodic CSI-RS
resource is measured for L1-RSRP measurement on any FR2 serving
frequency in the same band, and the CSI-RS resource is outside
measurement gap and overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI

#### 9.2.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

UE are required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when
the SSB is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE.
When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by the union set
of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on the
same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within SMTC window duration defined in
clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

##### 9.2.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to
be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to
be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer in TS 38.331
\[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is configured, the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to
be measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration.
If the high layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331
\[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1*

When TDD intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell should also apply to all other
serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially
overlap with aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.2.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

> If the following conditions are met:
>
> \- The UE has been notified about system information update through
> paging,
>
> \- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
> Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
> PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
> slots
>
> The UE is expected to receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the
> Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to
> be measured.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell should also apply to all other
serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially
overlap with aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.2.5.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR
measurement on an FR2 intra-frequency cell

The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1
data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within
SMTC window duration (The signaling *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is always
enabled for FR2) . If the high layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured
in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the
SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

The following scheduling restriction applies to SS-RSRQ measurement on
an FR2 intra-frequency cell

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, RSSI
measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration (The signaling
*deriveSSB\_IndexFromCellc* is always enabled for FR2). If the high
layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell should also apply to all other
serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially
overlap with aforementioned restricted symbols.

If following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, the
UE is expected to receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be
measured; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, the
UE is expected to receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that the
UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured.

##### 9.2.5.3.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR2 serving cell frequency layer.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR1 serving cell frequency layer.

#### 9.2.5.4 SFTD Measurements between PCell and PSCell

##### 9.2.5.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains SFTD measurement requirements for UE which supports
NR-DC and is configured with a PSCell in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The UE
shall perform SFTD measurement between PCell and PSCell, and report the
SFTD result with/without SS-RSRP after the network requests with
*reportType* for the associated *reportConfig* set to *reportSFTD*. The
overall delay includes RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\], and SFTD measurement reporting delay in clause
9.2.5.4.3.

##### 9.2.5.4.2 SFTD Measurement delay

When no DRX is used in either of PCell and PSCell, the physical layer
measurement period of the SFTD measurement shall be T~measure\_SFTD1~ =
max(200, 5 x SMTC period) ms, where the SMTC period refers to the
maximum between the configured SMTC period in PCell and PSCell.

When DRX is used in either of the PCell or the PSCell, or in both PCell
and PSCell, the physical layer measurement period (T~measure\_SFTD1~) of
the SFTD measurement shall be as specified in Table 9.2.5.4.2-1.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If PSCell is changed without changing carrier frequency of PSCell, while
the UE is performing SFTD measurements, the UE shall still meet SFTD
measurement and accuracy requirements for the new PSCell. In this case
the UE shall restart the SFTD measurement, and the total physical layer
measurement period shall not exceed T~measure\_SFTD2~ as defined by the
following expression:

T~measure\_SFTD2~ = (M+1)\*(T~measure\_SFTD1~) +
M\*T~PSCell\_change\_NRDC~

where:

M is the number of times the NR PSCell is changed over the measurement
period (T~measure\_SFTD2~), and

T~PSCell\_change\_NRDC~ is the time necessary to change the PSCell; it
can be up to 25 ms.

If PCell is changed, or if PSCell is changed with different carrier
frequency from PSCell, the UE shall terminate SFTD measurements.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement when DRX is used as
well as when no DRX is used shall be as specified in the sub-clause
10.1.21.

##### 9.2.5.4.3 SFTD Measurement Reporting Delay

*The SFTD measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between a
command that will trigger an SFTD measurement report and the point when
the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface.* This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This measurement reporting delay excludes any delay
caused by no UL resources available for UE to send the measurement
report.

The SFTD measurement reporting delay shall be less than measurement
period defined in clause 9.2.5.4.2 plus the RRC procedure delay defined
in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.2.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2.6.1 Void

#### 9.2.6.2 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It is assumed
that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2.6.2-1 or 9.2.6.2-2.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2.6.2-3.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.2.6.3-1 or 9.2.6.3-2.

M~meas\_period\ with\_gaps~ =24.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2 is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~

If MCG DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in Table 9.2.6.2-1, Table
9.2.6.2-2, and Table 9.2.6.2-3 shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG
DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for intra-frequency
measurement in SCG specified in Table 9.2.6.2-1, Table 9.2.6.2-2, and

9.3 NR inter-frequency measurements
-----------------------------------

### 9.3.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or PSCell,
even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities
is provided.

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ on an inter-frequency measurement object which
starts earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor detect
SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which ends later than the gap end --
switching time. When the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-FR
gap is configured to the UE in EN-DC, SA NR, NE-DC and NR-DC, or the
serving cells are in FR2, the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the
per-UE gap is configured to the UE in SA NR and NR-DC, the switching
time is 0.25ms. Otherwise the switching time is 0.5ms.

### 9.3.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3 apply, provided:

> \- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

> \- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4 and 10.1.5
> for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9 and 10.1.10
> for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14 and
> 10.1.15 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
> Band.

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1, 10.1.9.1, 10.1.10.1, 10.1.14.1 and
10.1.15.1, respectively.*

*The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3.6.3.*

#### 9.3.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1, 10.1.9.1, 10.1.10.1, 10.1.14.1 and 10.1.15.1,

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ *defined in clause 9.3.4* becomes
undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes
detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter *and then
triggers the measurement report as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than*
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ *defined in clause 9.3.5 provided the
timing to that cell has not changed more than* ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ Tc *while
measurement gap has not been available and the L3 filtering has not been

### 9.3.8 Inter-frequency SFTD measurement requirements

#### 9.3.8.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for a UE supporting NR inter-frequency
SFTD measurement and is applicable in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The UE
shall, depending on network request, perform inter-frequency SFTD
measurement and report SFTD result with or without SS-RSRP. The overall
delay includes RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\] and SFTD measurement reporting delay in clause 9.3.8.3.

UE which fulfils the requirements in clause 9.3.8 is not supposed to
fulfil the requirements defined in clause 9.2.5.4.

#### 9.3.8.2 SFTD Measurement delay

The requirements on SFTD measurement delay defined in this clause are
applicable under the side condition SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -3 dB for the
inter-frequency neighbour cell. Depending on configuration, the SFTD
measurement may be carried out with or without the support of configured
measurement gaps. In the current release, indication on whether to carry
out the SFTD measurement with or without measurement gaps is implicit
and depending on whether measurement gaps are configured.

The UE shall be able to detect, identify and measure SFTD of up to 3 of
the strongest applicable inter-frequency neighbour cells on the carrier
frequency provided in the SFTD measurement configuration. Further
depending on the SFTD measurement configuration, the UE shall
additionally report SS-RSRP for the one or more strongest cells. The UE
may or may not be configured with *cellsForWhichToReportSFTD*. The UE
does not expect *cellsForWhichToReportSFTD* to change during an ongoing
SFTD measurement.

When no measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of
finding the inter-frequency neighbour cell regardless of its SSB
position in the SMTC period, provided that the carrier frequency where
SFTD measurement is configured and the serving carrier(s) form a
supported CA or NR-DC band combination of the UE. The SFTD measurement
shall be conducted with sustained connection to the PCell and activated
SCell(s) in MCG. Depending on capability, the UE may be allowed to cause
a certain amount of interruptions for reconfiguration of the radio
receiver, as specified in clause 8.2.2.2.6.

When measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of finding
the inter-frequency neighbour cell under the additional condition that
the SSB at least occasionally falls within the measurement gap.

When no DRX is used, the UE shall be capable of determining SFTD within
a physical layer measurement period of T~measure\_SFTD1~ as follows:

> \- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and without
> additional SS-RSRP reporting:
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 14 SMTC periods
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 112 SMTC periods
>
> \- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and without additional
> SS-RSRP reporting:
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 8 ×
> Max(MGRP, SMTC period)
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 64
> × Max(MGRP, SMTC period)
>
> \- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and with additional
> SS-RSRP reporting:
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 19 SMTC periods
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 152 SMTC periods
>
> \- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and with additional
> SS-RSRP reporting:
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 13
> × Max(MGRP, SMTC period)
>
> \- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 104
> × Max(MGRP, SMTC period)

where CSSF~inter~ is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

When DRX is used, the same T~measure\_SFTD1~ as for non-DRX applies, but
the reporting delay depends on the DRX cycle length in use.

In case PCell is changed due to handover, the UE shall terminate the
inter-frequency SFTD measurement.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement shall fulfil the
requirement in clause 10.1.21.3. The measurement accuracy for
additionally reported SS-RSRP shall fulfil the requirement in clauses
10.1.4.1 and 10.1.5.1 for neighbour cell in FR1 and FR2, respectively.

#### 9.3.8.3 SFTD Measurement reporting delay

The SFTD measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between a
command that will trigger an SFTD measurement report and the point when
the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface.
This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty of 2 × TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting
the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE
to send the measurement report.

The SFTD measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~measure\_SFTD1~ defined in clause 9.3.8.2 plus the RRC procedure delay
defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

9.4 Inter-RAT measurements
--------------------------

### 9.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are specified for NR−E-UTRAN FDD and
NR−E-UTRAN TDD measurements and are applicable without an explicit
E-UTRAN neighbour cell list containing physical layer cell identities,
for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured with SA or NR-DC operation mode or configured in NE-DC
operation mode by PCell with NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD measurement (RSRP,
RSRQ, RS-SINR, RSTD, or E-CID) on E-UTRA non-serving frequency carrier,
and

\- configured with an appropriate measurement gap pattern according to
Table 9.1.2-3.

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD
measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR, or E-CID RSRP and RSRQ) configured by
NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency carrier, then the
corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements requirements specified
in clause 8.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\] shall apply.

Parameter T~Inter1~ used in inter-RAT requirements in clause 9.4 is
specified in Table 9.4.1-1.

RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN FDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

> \- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
> 10.2.2 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
> corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS
> 36.133 \[15\],

> 10.2.5 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
> corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS
> 36.133 \[15\].

#### 9.4.2.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure inter-RAT
cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern is scheduled, or the UE
supports capability of conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ according to the following expression:

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ FDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1,

> CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor for the
> measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated as specified
> in clause 9.1.5.2.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in Table 9.4.2.2-1.

**Table 9.4.2.2-1:** M**easurement period and measurement bandwidth**

  ----------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------

When measurement gaps are scheduled for E-UTRAN FDD inter-RAT
measurements, or the UE supports capability of conducting such
measurements without gaps, the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements to higher layers with
measurement period **T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~** given by table
9.4.2.2-1.

The UE shall be capable of identifying and performing NR -- E-UTRAN FDD
RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements of at least 4 identified E-UTRAN
FDD cells per E-UTRA FDD carrier frequency layer during each layer 1
measurement period, for up to 7 E-UTRA FDD carrier frequency layers.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.2.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When DRX is in use and measurement gaps are configured, the UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ specified in Table 9.4.2.3-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.2.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

##### 9.4.2.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.2.4.3.

##### 9.4.2.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap has not been
available and the L3 filter has not been used.

### 9.4.3 NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements

#### 9.4.3.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN TDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

> \- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
> 10.2.2 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
> corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS
> 36.133 \[15\],
>
> \- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
> 10.2.3 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
> corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS
> 36.133 \[15\],
>
> RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
> 10.2.5 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
> corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS
> 36.133 \[15\].

#### 9.4.3.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure inter-RAT
cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern is scheduled, or the UE
supports capability of conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ according to the following expression:

\- When configuration 0 or configuration 1 in Table 9.4.3.2-1 is
applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

> \- When configuration 2 or configuration 3 in Table 9.4.3.2-1 is
> applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} + 240 \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

> T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,
>
> T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1,
>
> CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor for the
> measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated as specified
> in clause 9.1.5.2.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in Table 9.4.3.2-1.

#### 9.4.3.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

##### 9.4.3.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.3.4.3.

##### 9.4.3.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.3.2 and 9.4.3.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap has not been
available and the L3 filter has not been used.

### 9.4.4 Inter-RAT RSTD measurements

#### 9.4.4.1 NR − E-UTRAN FDD RSTD measurements

##### 9.4.4.1.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSTD measurements
requested via LPP \[22, 27\].

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSTD
measurement configured by NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency
carrier, then the corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements
requirements as follows shall apply.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA PSCC shall meet E-UTRAN OTDOA
intra-frequency measurements requirements in clause 8.1.2.5. The
applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.10.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA SCC shall meet all applicable
requirements in clause 8.4, except that the terms PCell and primary
component carrier shall be deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.
The applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.12,
except that the terms PCell and primary component carrier shall be
deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.

The requirements in clause 9.4.4.1 apply when:

\- the UE is provided with the LTE timing information via LPP \[27\],
including both *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is not provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* or
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* but not with
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*.

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE may be using When the UE is not aware of
the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the OTDOA assistance data, the UE
may be using autonomous gaps to acquire SFN of the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell prior to requesting measurement gaps for performing the
requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements before the
![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.4930555555555556in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} time period starts while meeting all the
requirements in clause 9.4.4.1.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance
data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to acquire the SFN
before the ![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.4930555555555556in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} starts.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps to perform
cell detection for the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to
requesting measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD
measurements before the
![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.4930555555555556in"
height="0.2569444444444444in"} time period starts while meeting all the
requirements in clause 9.4.4.1.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance
data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to detect the cell
before the ![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.4930555555555556in"
height="0.2569444444444444in"} starts.

##### 9.4.4.1.2 Requirements

When the physical layer cell identities of neighbour cells together with
the OTDOA assistance data are provided, the UE shall be able to detect
and measure inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD RSTD, specified in TS 38.215 \[4\],
for at least *n*=16 cells, including the reference cell, within
![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.4916666666666667in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"} ms as given below:

![](./media/image26.wmf){width="3.283333333333333in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"},

where

![](./media/image27.wmf){width="1.4916666666666667in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"} is the total time for detecting and
measuring at least *n* cells,

![](./media/image37.wmf){width="0.8416666666666667in"

received energy per PRS resource element during the useful part of the
symbol to the average received power spectral density of the total noise
and interference for this resource element, where the ratio is measured
over all resource elements which carry PRS.

The time ![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.4916666666666667in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"} starts from the first subframe of the
PRS positioning occasion closest in time after both the
*OTDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message and the OTDOA assistance data
in the *OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData* message via LPP as specified in
TS 38.305 \[22\], are delivered to the physical layer of the UE.

The RSTD measurement accuracy for all measured neighbor cells *i* shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy as specified in clause 10.2.4.

##### 9.4.4.1.2.1 RSTD Measurement Reporting Delay {#rstd-measurement-reporting-delay .H6}

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

##### 9.4.4.1.2.2 Requirements for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell {#requirements-for-acquiring-the-timing-of-the-e-utra-otdoa-reference-cell .H6}

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE supporting per-FR gaps may make autonomous
gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the PCell, PSCell,
and each of the SCells in FR1 for acquiring SFN of the reference cell in
the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data, while no autonomous gaps in downlink
reception or uplink transmission are allowed in any of the UE serving
cells in FR2. The UE, which are only supporting per-UE gaps, may make
autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the
PCell, PSCell, and each of the SCells for acquiring the SFN of the
reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps while
indicating *eutra-FineTimingDetection* according to TS 38.331 \[2\] for
detecting the reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is performing one or both of SFN acquisition or cell
detection as specified above, the UE shall be able to determine the
timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell during the
time period

T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ = T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ + T~MIB~ + T~ECGI~ ,

where

T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ = T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ -
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ is according to clause 9.4.2 assuming
CSSF~interRAT~=1 and it is the time needed to detect the E-UTRA OTDOA
assistance data reference cell when the UE needs to acquire the subframe
and slot timing of the cell, provided the UE is configured with
measurement gaps (T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~=0 when both
*nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset* are provided in the
E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data or the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data
reference cell is known to the UE), and

T~MIB~ = 50 ms is the time required to acquire SFN and/or PHICH
configuration of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell
provided the OTDOA assistance data reference cell is decodable and at
least all E-UTRA subframes \#0 during T~MIB~ are available at the UE
receiver (T~MIB~=0 when *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* is provided in the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data and ECGI acquisition is not needed), and

T~ECGI~ = 100 ms is the time required to acquire ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell when *cellGlobalId* is included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* and the UE is not aware of the ECGI of this
cell (T~ECGI~ = 0 when *cellGlobalId* is not included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* or the UE is aware of the ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell).

When detecting the E-UTRAN OTDOA reference cell, the requirements in
this clause shall be met, provided the conditions for the detectable
cell are fulfilled according to clause 9.4.2.1. In addition, the MIB of
the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell whose SFN is acquired shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to TS 36.101 \[25\].

The requirement for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference
cell within T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well
as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

When T~MIB~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during T~MIB~, the UE
shall transmit at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB,\ FDD~ ACK/NACKs on PCell,
PSCell, and each of activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where the
autonomous gaps are created, specified in Table 9.4.4.1.2.2-1. When both
T~MIB~\>0 and T~ECGI~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during
T~MIB~+T~ECGI~, the UE shall transmit on PCell, PSCell, and each of
activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where autonomous gaps are
created at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB+ECGI,\ FDD~ ACK/NACKs specified in
Table 9.4.4.1.2.2-3, provided the OTDOA reference cell bandwidth is
configured in the OTDOA assistance data \[22, 27\]. The requirements in
Tables 9.4.4.1.2.2-1, 9.4.4.1.2.2-2, and 9.4.4.1.2.2-3 apply, provided
that:

> \- there is continuous DL data allocation,
>
> \- no DRX cycle is used,
>
> \- no measurement gaps are configured,
>
> \- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,
>
> \- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,
>
> \- 20 ms SMTC period is configured,
>
> \- SSBs are transmitted in one slot within SMTC window.

#### 9.4.4.2 NR − E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements

##### 9.4.4.2.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements
requested via LPP \[22, 27\].

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSTD
measurement configured by NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency
carrier, then the corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements
requirements as follows shall apply.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA PSCC shall meet E-UTRAN OTDOA
intra-frequency measurements requirements in clause 8.1.2.5. The
applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.10.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA SCC shall meet all applicable
requirements in clause 8.4, except that the terms PCell and primary
component carrier shall be deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.
The applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.12,
except that the terms PCell and primary component carrier shall be
deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.

The requirements in clause 9.4.4.1 apply when:

\- the UE is provided with the LTE timing information via LPP \[27\],
including both *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is not provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* or
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* but not with
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*.

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE may be using autonomous gaps to acquire
SFN of the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to requesting
measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements
before the ![](./media/image38.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} time period starts while meeting all the
requirements in clause 9.4.4.2.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance
data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to acquire the SFN
before the ![](./media/image38.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} starts. When the UE is not aware of and
cannot derive the subframe timing difference between the NR serving cell
and the OTDOA assistance data reference cell, the UE may need to request
measurement gaps to perform cell detection for the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell prior to requesting measurement gaps for performing the
requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements before the
![](./media/image38.wmf){width="1.5in" height="0.26666666666666666in"}
time period starts while meeting all the requirements in
clause 9.4.4.2.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance data is provided to
allow sufficient time for the UE to detect the cell before the
![](./media/image38.wmf){width="1.5in" height="0.26666666666666666in"}
starts.

is the number of PRS positioning occasions as defined in Table
9.4.4.2.2-1, where a PRS positioning occasion is as defined in
clause 9.4.4.1.2,

CSSF~interRAT~=CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor determined by
the gap sharing scheme for the RSTD measurements on the carrier
frequency *i* as defined in clause 9.1.5.2,

The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting RSTD for the
reference cell and all the neighbor cells *i* out of at least (*n*-1)
neighbor cells within ![](./media/image42.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} provided:

![](./media/image34.wmf){width="1.075in" height="0.3in"}≥-6 dB for all
Frequency Bands for the reference cell,

![](./media/image35.wmf){width="0.925in" height="0.2833333333333333in"}
conditions apply for all subframes of at least
![](./media/image36.wmf){width="0.5083333333333333in" height="0.425in"}
PRS positioning occasions,

PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to TS 36.133 \[15, Annex B.2.6\] for a
corresponding Band,

![](./media/image37.wmf){width="0.8416666666666667in"
height="0.2833333333333333in"} is as defined in clause 9.4.4.1.2.

The time ![](./media/image43.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} starts from the first subframe of the
PRS positioning occasion closest in time after both the
OTDOA-RequestLocationInformation message and the OTDOA assistance data
in the OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData message via LPP as specified in
TS 38.305 \[22\], are delivered to the physical layer of the UE.

The RSTD measurement accuracy for all measured neighbor cells *i* shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy as specified in clause 10.2.4.

##### 9.4.4.2.2.1 RSTD Measurement Reporting Delay {#rstd-measurement-reporting-delay-1 .H6}

This requirement assumes that that the measurement report is not delayed
by other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

##### 9.4.4.2.2.2 Requirements for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell {#requirements-for-acquiring-the-timing-of-the-e-utra-otdoa-reference-cell-1 .H6}

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE supporting per-FR gaps may make autonomous
gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the PCell, PSCell,
and each of the SCells in FR1 for acquiring SFN of the reference cell in
the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data, while no autonomous gaps in downlink
reception or uplink transmission are allowed in any of the UE serving
cells in FR2. The UE, which are only supporting per-UE gaps, may make
autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the
PCell, PSCell, and each of the SCells for acquiring the SFN of the
reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps while
indicating *eutra-FineTimingDetection* according to TS 38.331 \[2\] for
detecting the reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is performing one or both of SFN acquisition or cell
detection as specified above, the UE shall be able to determine the
timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell during the
time period

T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ = T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ + T~MIB~ + T~ECGI~ ,

where

T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ = T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ -
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ is according to clause 9.4.3 assuming
CSSF~interRAT~=1 and it is the time needed to detect the E-UTRA OTDOA
assistance data reference cell when the UE needs to acquire the subframe
and slot timing of the cell, provided the UE is configured with
measurement gaps (T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~=0 when both
*nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset* are provided in the
E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data or the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data
reference cell is known to the UE), and

T~MIB~ = 50 ms is the time required to acquire SFN and/or PHICH
configuration of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell
provided the OTDOA assistance data reference cell is decodable and at
least all E-UTRA subframes \#0 during T~MIB~ are available at the UE
receiver (T~MIB~=0 when *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* is provided in the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data and ECGI acquisition is not needed), and

T~ECGI~ = 100 ms is the time required to acquire ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell when *cellGlobalId* is included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* and the UE is not aware of the ECGI of this
cell (T~ECGI~ = 0 when *cellGlobalId* is not included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* or the UE is aware of the ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell).

When detecting the E-UTRAN OTDOA reference cell, the requirements in
this clause shall be met, provided the conditions for the detectable
cell are fulfilled according to clause 9.4.3.1. In addition, the MIB of
the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell whose SFN is acquired shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to TS 36.101 \[25\].

The requirement for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference
cell within T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well
as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

When T~MIB~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during T~MIB~, the UE
shall transmit at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB,\ TDD~ ACK/NACKs on PCell,
PSCell, and each of activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where the
autonomous gaps are created, specified in Table 9.4.4.2.2.2-1. When both
T~MIB~\>0 and T~ECGI~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during
T~MIB~+T~ECGI~, the UE shall transmit on PCell, PSCell, and each of
activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where autonomous gaps are
created at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB+ECGI,\ TDD~ ACK/NACKs specified in
Table 9.4.4.2.2.2-3, provided the OTDOA reference cell bandwidth is
configured in the OTDOA assistance data \[22, 27\]. The requirements in
Tables 9.4.4.2.2.2-1, 9.4.4.2.2.2-2 and 9.4.4.2.2.2-3 apply, provided
that:

\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

\- no DRX cycle is used,

\- no measurement gaps are configured,

\- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,

> \- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,
>
> \- 20 ms SMTC period is configured,

\- SSBs are transmitted in one slot within SMTC window.

resources of the *nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* and/or *csi-SSB-ResourceSet*
within the CSI-Resource*Config* settings configured for L1-RSRP for the
active BWP, provided that the number of resources does not exceed the UE
capability indicated by *beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the

> \- The CSI-RS or SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources configured for
> L1-RSRP measurements are measurable.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SSB the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.1 and
10.1.20.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant CSI-RS the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.2 and
10.1.20.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RS\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.2 for a
corresponding band.

A CSI-RS and SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered
measurable when the measurable resource conditions are met for both
CSI-RS resource and SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

### 9.5.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2 if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If
*nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if
groupBasedBeamReporting is enabled,* the UE shall use differential
L1-RSRP based reporting as defined in clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and 10.1.20
for FR2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2dB
step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in 10.1.6.

#### 9.5.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1 and
10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send periodic L1-RSRP measurement reports for an
active BWP.

measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or

aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports, if a DCI
trigger has been received.

aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~ is defined in Table
9.5.4.1-1 for FR1 and Table 9.5.4.1-2 for FR2, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- N= 8.

For FR1,

> \- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
> monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
> intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
> overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
SSB is not overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is not overlapped with measurement
gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC period (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

> \-
> P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
> when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
> partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
> SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

> \- P is $\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$\*
> P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement
> gap and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
> T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement
> gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{min(T_{\text{SMTCperiod}},MGRP)}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SSB~ \<MGRP)
and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\- P is $\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$\*
P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement
gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P is $\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$\*
P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement
gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)P~sharing\ factor~ = 1

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by SSB-ToMeasure and 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
SSB-ToMeasure and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by SSB-ToMeasure, given that SSB-ToMeasure is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by ss-RSSI-Measurement
and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
ss-RSSI-Measurement and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by ss-RSSI-Measurement, given that ss-RSSI-Measurement is configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

Where:

T~SSB~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell

T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet pervious
conditions.

when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~CSI-RS~ \<

measurement outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

Where:

T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period.

T~CSI-RS~ = the periodicity of CSI-RS configured for L1-RSRP measurement

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet pervious
conditions.

### 9.5.5 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS and SSB for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB and CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
without measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the
following clauses.

#### 9.5.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE shall be able
to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

#### 9.5.5.2 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is
not required to receive CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the
UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE
shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement without any
restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for
CBD measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when
beam failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the
same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource
set configured with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement without any restriction.

### 9.5.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.5.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as RS for L1-RSRP measurement
with the same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.5.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols corresponding
to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier
aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other bands than the
bands in which the serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
is configured.

#### 9.5.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement.

\- For the case where RS for L1-RSRP measurement is CSI-RS which is
QCLed with active TCI state for PDCCH/PDSCH and not in a CSI-RS resource
set with repetition ON, and N=1 applies as specified in clause 9.5.4.2

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed based on the CSI-RS.

\- Otherwise

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on

\- symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP
measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the periodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the semi-perssitent CSI-RS resource
configured for L1-RSRP measurement when the resource is activated,
and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the aperiodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement when the reporting is triggered.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
is expected to receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for
L1-RSRP measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
is expected to receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for
L1-RSRP measurement.

#### 9.5.6.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR2 serving cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR1 serving cell(s).

9.6 NE-DC: Measurements 
-----------------------

### 9.6.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for UE supporting dual connectivity
with NR PCell and E-UTRA FDD or TDD PSCell. The requirements apply to
UEs that have been configured with NE-DC.

### 9.6.2 SFTD Measurements

#### 9.6.2.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for reporting of
SFN and frame time difference between NR PCell and E-UTRA PSCell in
RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements comprise measurement reporting
delay and measurement accuracy. The overall measurement reporting delay
includes a RRC procedure delay specified in TS 38.331 \[2\], and the
SFTD measurement reporting delay specified below.

#### 9.6.2.2 SFTD Measurement requirements

When no DRX is used in either of the NR PCell and E-UTRA PSCell, the
physical layer measurement period of the SFTD measurement shall be
T~measure\_SFTD1~ = max(0.2, 5 \* SMTC period) s.

When DRX is used in either of the NR PCell or the E-UTRA PSCell, or in
both PCell and PSCell, the physical layer measurement period
(T~measure\_SFTD1~) of the SFTD measurement shall be as specified in
Table 9.6.2.2-1.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If PSCell is changed without changing carrier frequency of PSCell while
the UE is performing SFTD measurements, the UE shall still meet SFTD
measurement and accuracy requirements for the new PSCell. In this case
the UE shall restart the SFTD measurement, and the total physical layer
measurement period shall not exceed T~measure\_SFTD2~ as defined by the
following expression:

T~measure\_SFTD2~ = (M+1)\*(T~measure\_SFTD1~) +
M\*T~PSCell\_change\_NEDC~

where:

M is the number of times the E-UTRA PSCell is changed over the
measurement period (T~measure\_SFTD2~), and

T~PSCell\_change\_NEDC~ is the time necessary to change the PSCell; it
can be up to 25 ms.

If PCell is changed, or if PSCell is changed to a different carrier
frequency, the UE shall terminate the SFTD measurement.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement when DRX is used as
well as when no DRX is used shall be as specified in clause 10.1.21.1.

10 Measurement Performance requirements
=======================================

10.1 NR measurements
--------------------

### 10.1.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1 apply as follows:

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for PCell measurements in SA,
NR-DC, or NE-DC operaion mode,

on NR carrier frequencies,

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for measurements from one cell on
a frequency compared to the measurement from another cell on a different
frequency.

In the requirements of clause 10.1, the exceptions for side conditions
apply as follows:

\- for the UE capable of CA but not configured with any SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,

frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1.3.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the SS-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
in FR2.

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.4.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRP in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] Clause 7.3
> for reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

##### 10.1.5.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the SS-RSRP measured from
another cell on another frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.5.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in 38.101-2 \[19\] Clause 7.3 for reference
> sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27dB
>
> \- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

### 10.1.6 RSRP Measurement Report Mapping

The reporting range of SS-RSRP for L3 reporting is defined from -156 dBm
to -31 dBm with 1 dB resolution. The reporting range of SS-RSRP and
CSI-RSRP for L1 reporting is defined from -140 to -44 dBm with 1 dB
resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.6.1-1. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

The reporting range of differential SS-RSRP and CSI-RSRP for L1
reporting is defined from 0 dBm to -30 dB with 2 dB resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.6.1-2. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

#### 10.1.8.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRQ accuracy requirements in FR2

##### 10.1.8.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRQ Accuracy in FR2

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SS-RSRQ in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.8.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.9.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRQ in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRQ in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.9.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

10.1.10.1 Inter-frequency SS-RSRQ accuracy requirements in FR2

10.1.10.1.1 Aboslute Accuracy of SS-RSRQ in FR2

The requirements for absolute accuracy of SS-RSRQ in this clause apply
to a cell on a frequency in FR2 that has different carrier frequency
from the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.10.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

10.1.10.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRQ in FR2

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRQ in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.10.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

### 10.1.13 Intra-frequency SINR accuracy requirements for FR2

10.1.13.1 Intra-frequency SS-SINR accuracy requirements in FR2

10.1.13.1.1 Absolute SS-SINR Accuracy in FR2

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SS-SINR in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.13.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

10.1.14.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-SINR in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-SINR in inter frequency case is defined as
the SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

### 10.1.15 Inter-frequency SINR accuracy requirements for FR2

10.1.15.1 Inter-frequency SS-SINR accuracy requirements in FR2

10.1.15.1.1 Aboslute Accuracy of SS-SINR in FR2

The requirements for absolute accuracy of SS-SINR in this clause apply
to a cell on a frequency in FR2 that has different carrier frequency
from the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.15.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

10.1.15.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-SINR in FR2

The relative accuracy of SS-SINR in inter frequency case is defined as
the SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.15.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

10.1.19.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SSB based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to
> Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

10.1.19.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

10.1.19.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to
> Annex B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.
>
> \- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.1-1.

10.1.19.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to
> Annex B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.
>
> \- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.2-1.

10.1.20.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SSB based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to
> Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

10.1.20.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

10.1.20.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to
> Annex B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.
>
> \- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.1-1.

10.1.20.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to
> Annex B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.
>
> \- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.2-1.

10.2 E-UTRAN measurements
-------------------------

### 10.2.1 Introduction

Accuracy requirements for measurements on E-UTRAN carrier frequencies
are specified in clause 10.2 and apply for UE in SA or NR-DC or NE-DC
operation mode.

The requirements in clause 10.2 are applicable for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state

\- performing measurements with appropriate measurement gaps according
to clause 9.1.2.

\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.

The reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering shall be an
estimate of the average value of the measured quantity over the
measurement period. The reference point for the measurement result after
layer 1 filtering is referred to as point B in the measurement model
described in TS 36.300 \[24\].

The accuracy requirements of E-UTRA measurements in this clause are
valid for the reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering. The
accuracy requirements are verified from the measurement report at point
D in the measurement model having the layer 3 filtering disabled.

If the UE needs measurement gaps to perform the inter-RAT NR ─ E-UTRAN
FDD and NR ─ E-UTRAN TDD measurements, the relevant measurement
procedure and measurement gap patterns stated in clause 9.1.2 shall
apply.

### 10.2.2 E-UTRAN RSRP measurements

NOTE: This measurement is for handover between NR and E-UTRAN.

The measurement period of E-UTRA RSRP in RRC\_CONNECTED state is
specified in clause 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

The accuracy requirements of E-UTRA RSRP measurements in RRC\_CONNECTED
state and the corresponding side conditions shall be the same as the
inter-frequency RSRP Accuracy Requirements in clause 9.1.3 of TS
36.133 \[15\].

The reporting range and mapping specified for RSRP measurements in
clause 9.1.4 of TS 36.133 \[15\] shall apply.

### 10.2.3 E-UTRAN RSRQ measurements

NOTE: This measurement is for handover between NR and E-UTRAN.

The measurement period of E-UTRA RSRQ in RRC\_CONNECTED state is
specified in clause 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

The accuracy requirements of E-UTRA RSRQ measurements in RRC\_CONNECTED
state and the corresponding side conditions shall be the same as the
inter-frequency RSRQ Accuracy Requirements in clause 9.1.6 of
TS 36.133 \[15\].

The requirements for accuracy of E-UTRA RSRQ measurements in
RRC\_CONNECTED state and the corresponding side conditions shall be the
same as the inter-frequency RSRQ Accuracy Requirements in clause 9.1.6
of TS 36.133 \[15\].

The reporting range and mapping specified for RSRQ measurements in
clause 9.1.7 of TS 36.133 \[15\] shall apply.

### 10.2.4 E-UTRAN RSTD measurements

The requirements in this clause are valid for UE supporting this
capability.

The measurement period is specified in clauses 9.4.4.1 and 9.4.4.2 for
inter-RAT NR ─ E-UTRAN FDD and inter-RAT NR ─ E-UTRAN TDD RSTD
measurements, respectively.

The accuracy requirements and the corresponding side conditions shall be
the same as the inter-frequency measurement accuracy requirements for
RSTD measurements in RRC\_CONNECTED in clause 9.1.10.2 of
TS 36.133 \[15\].

If the UE needs measurement gaps to perform the inter-RAT NR ─ E-UTRAN
FDD and NR ─ E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements, the relevant measurement
procedure and measurement gap patterns stated in clause 9.1.2 shall
apply.

The reporting range and mapping for the inter-RAT NR ─ E-UTRAN FDD and
NR ─ E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements is the same as specified for RSTD
measurements in TS 36.133 \[15, clauses 9.1.10.3 and 9.1.10.4\].

### 10.2.5 E-UTRAN RS-SINR measurements

NOTE: This measurement is for handover between NR and E-UTRAN.

The measurement period of E-UTRA RS-SINR in RRC\_CONNECTED state is
specified in clause 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

The accuracy requirements of E-UTRA RS-SINR measurements in
RRC\_CONNECTED state and the corresponding side conditions shall be the
same as the inter-frequency RS-SINR Accuracy Requirements in
clause 9.1.17.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\].

The reporting range and mapping for E-UTRA RS-SINR measurements shall be
the same as specified for RS-SINR measurements in clause 9.1.17.1 of TS
36.133 \[15\].
