4 Background
============

In 3GPP RAN4 \#AH2 meeting, it is proposed that new bands for NR are
assigned band numbers on a "first come first served" basis in reserved
ranges regardless of duplex mode or RAT. Then, in RAN4 \#84 meeting,
band 3.3-3.8 GHz and band 3.3-4.2GHz are assigned band number n78 and
n77 respectively.

5 NR Frequency band definition
==============================

In 3GPP, RAN 4 specified two NR operating bands n77 and n78 in
3.3GHz-4.2GHz. A UE supporting n78 band is not required to support n77
band \[2\].

For band n77 and band n78, addition to the UE channel BWs for the band,
30 MHz, 70 MHz and 90 MHz are supported for BS. These new BS CBWs have
low priority compared to the UE channel BWs.

7 NR band 3.3GHz - 3.8GHz specific issues
=========================================

7.1 UE specific
---------------

### 7.1.1 Transmitter characteristics

#### 7.1.1.1 UE maximum output power

The MOP requirements for Band 42 and 43 single-carrier were specified as
23 dBm +2/-3 dB for power class 3 based on simulation results shown in
Table 7.1.1.1-1 in August 2011.

Table 7.1.1.1-1. Simulation results for combined Band 42 and Band 43
filter \[R4-114656\]

             Bandwidth   Max IL (corner)   2f~0~ rejection   2.7 GHz rejection
  ---------- ----------- ----------------- ----------------- -------------------
  Design 7   400 MHz     1.9               20 dB             30 dB
  Design 8   400 MHz     2.3               15 dB             10 dB
  Design 9   400 MHz     2.0               20 dB             15 dB

When specifying MOP requirements of Band n77 and n78, the delta to be
checked is IL impact of BPF due to the extension of pass-bandwidth. It
is shown in Table 7.1.1.1-2.

With comparison between Table 7.1.1.1-1 and Table 7.1.1.1-2, it was
concluded that there is no degradation of IL at ETC even with the
extension and agreed to specify the same MOP as that of Band 42 and 43
(i.e., 23 dBm +2/-3 dB) for Band n77 and n78 of power class 3.

Agreement: MOP is to be specified as 23 dBm +2/-3 dB for Band n77 and
n78 of power class 3

The following NR UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for
any transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth for non-CA
configuration and UL-MIMO unless otherwise stated.

Table 7.1.1.1-3: NR UE power classes

  **NR Operating band**   **Class 2**       **Class 3**       **Comments**

  n77                     26 dBm +2/-3 dB   23 dBm +2/-3 dB   3.3 - 4.2 GHz
  n78                     26 dBm +2/-3 dB   23 dBm +2/-3 dB   3.3 - 3.8 GHz
  n79                     26 dBm +2/-3 dB   23 dBm +2/-3 dB   4.4 - 5 GHz

For a power class 2 UE, applicability to certain restriction of
uplink/downlink configuration is TBD.

If UE is configured for power class 2 UE, the requirements in Table
7.1.1.1-4.

#### 7.1.1.2 UE maximum output power for modulation / channel bandwidth

For UE Power 2 and 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the
maximum output power is not band specific requirement. MPR follow the
requirements of general aspects for UE RF in TR 38.817-01 \[10\].

#### 7.1.1.3 UE maximum output power with additional requirements

UE maximum output power with additional requirements follows A-MPR
requirements of general aspects for UE RF in TR 38.817-01 \[10\].

#### 7.1.1.4 Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR)

NR adjacent channel leakage power ratio (NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned NR channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent NR channel frequency at
nominal channel spacing.

The assigned NR channel power and adjacent NR channel power are measured
with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in
Table 7.1.1.4-1.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than \[--50dBm\] then
the NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in
Table 7.1.1.4-2.

No changes to Table 7.1.1.5-1 are needed as a result of Band n78 power
class 2 operation.

#### 7.1.1.6 Spurious emissions 

Since Band n77 and/or n78 will be used at least in Japan, bands operated
in Japan need to be protected. In addition, protected bands required in
Europe, Korea and China regions (i.e., operating bands specified for
Band n78 of 3.3-3.8 GHz) should also be added for potential use of these
bands. As a consequence, required protected bands for Band n77 and n78
will be the same. Note that it was already agreed not to specify the
co-existence requirement between Band n77 and Band n79, which means that
the co-existence will be guaranteed by the NR general emission
requirements.

#### 7.1.2.2 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive a NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence
of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the
centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

It is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and
upper range of test parameters are chosen in Table 7.1.2.2-2 and Table
7.1.2.2-3 where the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.2.3 and A.3.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[8\] (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 of TS 38.101-1 \[8\]).

#### 7.1.2.3 Blocking

##### 7.1.2.3.1 Out-of-band blocking

Based on filter performance shown in Table 7.1.1.1-2, out-of-band
blocking requirement needs to be optimized as with LTE band 42 and 43 as
shown in Table 7.1.2.3-1. Wanted signal level is the same as that of LTE
refarming bands.

Agreement: Out-of-band blocking for n78 should be specified as below.

For UE(s) equipped with 4 antenna ports, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.1.2.5-1 shall be modified by the amount
given in ΔR~IB,4R~ in Table 7.1.2.5-1a for the applicable NR bands.

Table 7.1.2.5-1a: ΔRIB,4R

  NR Band                    ΔR~IB,4R~ \[dB\]
  -------------------------- ------------------
  1.7GHz \< NR band \<3GHz   \- 2.7
  NR band \> 3GHz            \- 2.2

For the ACS and blocking requirements in section in 7.1.2.2 and 7.1.2.3
as well as Spurious response and Receiver intermodulation requirements,
it should be noted that the REFSENS power level for these requirements
represents for two and four antenna ports, respectively.

7.2 BS specific
---------------

The operating band Band n78 is 3300MHz\~3800MHz, belonging to FR1,
therefore only 3 distinct types of NR BS each has a different
architecture and requirements set are applied, which are *BS type 1-C*,
*BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O.*

For Band n78 power class 2 HPUE, it can be foreseen that there are no
additional BS receive blocking such as in-band blocking and out-of-band
blocking requirements introduced.

### 7.2.1 Operating band unwanted emissions

The operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits are defined from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating
band up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported
downlink operating band. According to the WF in R4-1706223, Δf~OBUE~=40
MHz for NR bands wider than 100 MHz as baseline for the boundary between
UEM and spurious emission( for both Cat A and Cat B ). Therefore for
Band n78, Δf~OBUE~ should be40 MHz.

#### 7.2.1.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The *basic limits* of the operating band unwanted emission for Band n78
is the based on the same principles as for LTE, where the unwanted
emission limits for \>=5MHz channel bandwidth of each BS classes( Wide
Area BS(band \>1GHz), Medium Range BS and Local Area BS) can be applied
to Cat A and Cat B for the unwanted emission basic limits for Band n78.

\- For BS type 1-C, the operating band unwanted emissions requirement
for each *antenna connector* shall be defined based on *basic limits*
with no scaling and no antenna considered.

\- For BS type 1-H, the operating band unwanted emissions requirements
are for each *TAB connector TX* shall be defined based on *base limits*.
*The power summation emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector
TX min cell shall not* exceed the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

#### 7.2.1.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The OTA operating band unwanted emissions requirements are applied at
RIB and based on the emission scaling, where the emission limits are
defined as basic limit+9dB, where the basic limits are specified in
subclause 7.2.1.1.

### 7.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements

#### 7.2.2.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The additional spurious emission requirement may be applied for the
protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the BS
downlink operating band. It is proposed that the same limits as TDD
E-UTRA bands (i.e. -52 dBm/MHz) can be applied for the *basic limits*
for NR band n78.

In addition, since the Band n77 and n78 are overlapping operating bands,
and these two bands may be deployed in the same geographical area, thus
this requirement does not apply to BS operating in Band n77 and n78.

*For BS type 1-C*, the emissions requirements for each *antenna
connector* shall be defined based on *basic limits* with no scaling and
no antenna considered.

*For BS type 1-H*, the emissions requirements are for each *TAB
connector shall be defined based on the basics limits, The power
summation emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min
cell shall not* exceed the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

#### 7.2.2.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The OTA minimum requirements are applied at RIB and based on the
emission scaling, where the emission limits are defined as basic
limits+9dB, where the basic limits are specified in subclause 7.2.2.1.

### 7.2.3 Co-location with other base stations

#### 7.2.3.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between transmitter
and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class. Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA for different
BS classes can be applied for the *basic limits* of co-location
requirements for each BS classes for NR Bands n78.

For BS type 1-C, the emissions requirements for each antenna connector
shall be defined based on basic limits with no scaling and no antenna
considered.

For BS type 1-H, the emissions requirements are for each *TAB connector
shall be defined based on the basics limits, The power summation
emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell shall
not* exceed the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

7.2.3.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The OTA co-location with other base stations requirements are specified
as co-location requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as
described in TR 37.843 \[9\].

The output of the *co-location reference antenna* of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the *basic limits* in subclause 7.2.3.1 + X
dB, where X = -21 dB.

### 7.2.4 General blocking requirement

#### 7.2.4.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating
band up to 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating
band for NR Band n78, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the
operating band.

The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency
range, which is from 1MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
uplink operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the
uplink operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n78, but
includes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H*.

#### 7.2.4.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating
band up to 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating
band for NR Band n78, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the
operating band.

The *BS type 1-O* in-band blocking requirements apply at the RIB when
the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the interfering
signal are from the same direction and are within OTA REFSEN *RoAOA* and
*minSENS RoAoA.*

The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency
range, which is from 30MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
uplink operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the
uplink operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n78, but
includes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.

The *BS type 1-O* out-of -band blocking requirements apply at the RIB
when the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the
interfering signal are from the same direction and are within *minSENS
RoAoA.*

### 7.2.5 Blocking requirement for co-location with other base stations

7.2.5.1 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between interfering
transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations
of the same class. Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA
for different BS classes can be applied for the *base limits* of
co-location requirements for each BS classes for NR Bands n78.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H*.

7.2.5.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The OTA co-location blocking requirements are specified as co-location
requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as described in TR
37.843 \[9\].

The interferer power level is specified per polarization and defined as
a power into the conducted input of the co-location reference antenna.

### 8.1.1 Transmitter characteristics

#### 8.1.1.1 UE maximum output power

Based on the same discussion as UE maximum output power of Band n78
described in clause 7.1.1.1, the following was agreed.

Agreement: MOP is to be specified as 23 dBm +2/-3 dB for Band n77 and
n78 of power class 3

The following NR UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for
any transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth for non-CA
configuration and UL-MIMO unless otherwise stated.

Table 8.1.1.1-1: NR UE power classes

  **NR Operating band**   **Class 2**       **Class 3**       **Comments**
  ----------------------- ----------------- ----------------- ---------------
  n77                     26 dBm +2/-3 dB   23 dBm +2/-3 dB   3.3 - 4.2 GHz
  n78                     26 dBm +2/-3 dB   23 dBm +2/-3 dB   3.3 - 3.8 GHz
  n79                     26 dBm +2/-3 dB   23 dBm +2/-3 dB   4.4 - 5 GHz

For a power class 2 UE, applicability to certain restriction of
uplink/downlink configuration is TBD.

If UE is configured for power class 2 UE, the requirements in Table
8.1.1.1-2.

  ----------------------------------------------------

#### 8.1.1.2 UE maximum output power for modulation / channel bandwidth

For UE Power 2 and 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the
maximum output power is not band specific requirement. MPR follow
requirements of general aspects for UE RF in TR 38.817-01 \[10\].

#### 8.1.1.3 UE maximum output power with additional requirements

UE maximum output power with additional requirements follows A-MPR
requirements of general aspects for UE RF in TR 38.817-01 \[10\].

#### 8.1.1.4 Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR)

NR adjacent channel leakage power ratio (NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned NR channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent NR channel frequency at
nominal channel spacing.

The assigned NR channel power and adjacent NR channel power are measured
with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in
Table 8.1.1.4-1.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than \[--50dBm\] then
the NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in
Table 8.1.1.4-2.

#### 8.1.1.5 Spectrum emission mask 

The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in
Table 8.1.1.5-1 for the specified channel bandwidth.

n77 power class 2 operation.

#### 8.1.2.1 Reference sensitivity

Based on the same discussion as reference sensitivity of Band n78
described in clause 7.1.2.1, the following was agreed.

> ***Agreement: REFSENS for Band n77 at 3.3-3.8 GHz and n78 should be 1

#### 8.1.2.2 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive a NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence
of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the
centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

It is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and
upper range of test parameters are chosen in Table 8.1.2.2-2 and Table
8.1.2.2-3 where the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.2.3 and A.3.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[8\] (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 of TS 38.101-1 \[8\]).

8.2 BS specific
---------------

The operating band Band n77 is 3300MHz\~4200MHz, belonging to FR1,
therefore only 3 distinct types of NR BS each has a different
architecture and requirements set are applied, which are *BS type 1-C*,
*BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O.*

For Band n77 power class 2 HPUE, it can be foreseen that there are no
additional BS receive blocking such as in-band blocking and out-of-band
blocking requirements introduced.

### 8.2.1 Operating band unwanted emissions

The operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits are defined from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating
band up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported
downlink operating band. According to the WF in R4-1706223, Δf~OBUE~=40
MHz for NR bands wider than 100 MHz as baseline for the boundary between
UEM and spurious emission( for both Cat A and Cat B ). Therefore for
Band n77, Δf~OBUE~ should be 40 MHz.

#### 8.2.1.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The *basic limits* of the operating band unwanted emission for Band n77
is the based on the same principles as for LTE, where the unwanted
emission limits for \>=5MHz channel bandwidth of each BS classes( Wide
Area BS(band \>1GHz), Medium Range BS and Local Area BS) can be applied
to Cat A and Cat B for the unwanted emission basic limits for Band n77.

For *BS type 1-C*, the operating band unwanted emissions requirement for
each *antenna connector* shall be defined based on *basic limits* with
no scaling and no antenna considered.

For *BS type 1-H*, the operating band unwanted emissions requirements
are for each *TAB connector TX* shall be defined based on *base limits*.
*The power summation emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector
TX min cell shall not* exceed the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The OTA operating band unwanted emissions requirements are applied at
RIB and based on the emission scaling, where the emission limits are
defined as basic limit+9dB, where the basic limits are specified in
subclause 8.2.1.1.

### 8.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements

#### 8.2.2.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The additional spurious emission requirement may be applied for the
protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the BS
downlink operating band. It is proposed that the same limits as TDD
E-UTRA bands (i.e. -52 dBm/MHz) can be applied for the *basic limits*
for NR band n77.

In addition, since the Band n77 and n78 are overlapping operating bands,
and these two bands may be deployed in the same geographical area, thus
this requirement does not apply to BS operating in Band n77 and n78.

For *BS type 1-C*, the emissions requirements for each *antenna
connector* shall be defined based on *basic limits* with no scaling and
no antenna considered.

For *BS type 1-H*, the emissions requirements are for each *TAB
connector TX shall be defined based on the basics limits, The power
summation emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min
cell shall not* exceed the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The OTA minimum requirements are applied at RIB and based on the
emission scaling, where the emission limits are defined as basic
limit+9dB, where the basic limits are specified in subclause 8.2.2.1.

### 8.2.3 Co-location with other base stations

#### 8.2.3.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between transmitter
and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class. Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA for different
BS classes can be applied for the *basic limits* of co-location
requirements for each BS classes for NR Bands n77.

For BS type 1-C, the emissions requirements for each *antenna connector*
shall be defined based on *basic limits* with no scaling and no antenna
considered.

For BS type 1-H, the emissions requirements are for each *TAB connector
shall be defined based on the basics limits, The power summation
emission at the TAB connectors of the TAB connector TX min cell shall
not* exceed the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The OTA co-location with other base stations requirements are specified
as co-location requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as
described in TR 37.843 \[9\].

The output of the *co-location reference antenna* of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the *basic limits* in subclause 7.2.3.1 + X
dB, where X = -21 dB.

### 8.2.4 General blocking requirement

#### 8.2.4.1 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H

The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating
band up to 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating
band for NR Band n77, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the
operating band.

The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency
range, which is from 1MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
uplink operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the
uplink operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n77, but
includes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H*.

#### 8.2.4.2 Minimum requirement for BS type 1-O

The blocking requirements apply in the in-band blocking frequency range,
which is from 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the uplink operating
band up to 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the uplink operating
band for NR Band n77, but excludes the downlink frequency range of the
operating band.

The *BS type 1-O* in-band blocking requirements apply at the RIB when
the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the interfering
signal are from the same direction and are within OTA REFSEN *RoAOA* and
*minSENS RoAoA.*

The blocking requirements apply in the out-of-band blocking frequency
range, which is from 30MHz to 60 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
uplink operating band or from 60 MHz above the highest frequency of the
uplink operating band to 12750MHz for NR BS operating in Band n77, but
includes the downlink frequency range of the operating band.

The *BS type 1-O* out-of -band blocking requirements apply at the RIB
when the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the
interfering signal are from the same direction and are within *minSENS
RoAoA.*

### 8.2.5 Blocking requirement for co-location with other base stations

8.2.5.1 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The conduct requirements assume a 30dB coupling loss between interfering
transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base stations
of the same class. Thus, it is proposed that the same limits as E-UTRA
for different BS classes can be applied for the *base limits* of
co-location requirements for each BS classes for NR Bands n77.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H*.

8.2.5.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The OTA co-location blocking requirements are specified as co-location
requirements using the co-location reference antenna, as described in TR
37.843 \[9\].

The interferer power level is specified per polarization and defined as
a power into the conducted input of the co-location reference antenna.
