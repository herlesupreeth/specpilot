**Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS):** statement made by the
supplier of an implementation or system claimed to conform to a given
specification, stating which capabilities have been implemented

**ICS proforma:** document, in the form of a questionnaire, which when
completed for an implementation or system becomes an ICS

**Implementation extra Information for Testing (IXIT):** A statement
made by a supplier or implementer of an UEUT which contains or
references all of the information (in addition to that given in the ICS)
related to the UEUT and its testing environment, which will enable the
test laboratory to run an appropriate test suite against the UEUT

######## Annex A (normative):ICS proforma for NR/5GS Generation User Equipment

Notwithstanding the provisions of the copyright clause related to the
text of the present document, The Organizational Partners of 3GPP grant
that users of the present document may freely reproduce the ICS proforma
in this annex so that it can be used for its intended purposes and may
further publish the completed ICS.

A.1 Guidance for completing the ICS proforma
============================================

A.1.1 Purposes and structure
----------------------------

The purpose of this ICS proforma is to provide a mechanism whereby a
supplier of an implementation of the requirements defined in relevant
specifications may provide information about the implementation in a
standardised manner.

The ICS proforma is subdivided into clauses for the following categories
of information:

\- instructions for completing the ICS proforma;

\- identification of the implementation;

\- identification of the protocol;

\- ICS proforma tables (for example: UE implementation types,
Teleservices, etc).

A.1.2 Abbreviations and conventions
-----------------------------------

The ICS proforma contained in this annex is comprised of information in
tabular form in accordance with the guidelines presented in
ISO/IEC 9646‑7 \[18\].

##### Item column {#item-column .H6}

The item column contains a number which identifies the item in the
table.

##### Item description column {#item-description-column .H6}

The item description column describes in free text each respective item
(e.g. parameters, timers, etc.). It implicitly means \"is \<item
description\> supported by the implementation?\".

##### Reference column {#reference-column .H6}

The reference column gives reference to the relevant 3GPP core
specifications.

##### Release column {#release-column .H6}

The release column indicates the earliest release from which the
capability or option is relevant.

##### Mnemonic column {#mnemonic-column .H6}

The Mnemonic column contains mnemonic identifiers for each item.

##### Comments column {#comments-column .H6}

This column is left blank for particular use by the reader of the
present document.

##### References to items {#references-to-items .H6}

For each possible item answer (answer in the support column) within the
ICS proforma there exists a unique reference, used, for example, in the
conditional expressions. It is defined as the table identifier, followed
by a solidus character \"/\", followed by the item number in the table.
If there is more than one support column in a table, the columns shall
be discriminated by letters (a, b, etc.), respectively.

A.1.3 Instructions for completing the ICS proforma
--------------------------------------------------

The supplier of the implementation may complete the ICS proforma in each
of the spaces provided. More detailed instructions are given at the
beginning of the different clauses of the ICS proforma.

A.2 Identification of the User Equipment
========================================

Identification of the User Equipment should be filled in so as to
provide as much detail as possible regarding version numbers and
configuration options.

The product supplier information and client information should both be
filled in if they are different.

A person who can answer queries regarding information supplied in the
ICS should be named as the contact person.

A.2.1 Date of the statement
