4 General
=========

4.1 Introduction
----------------

This specification is organised as follows:

\- clause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;

\- clause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as
the services expected from lower layers;

\- clause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;

\- clause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;

\- clause 6 specifies the RRC messages in ASN.1 and description;

\- clause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and
constants) and counters to be used by the UE;

\- clause 8 specifies the encoding of the RRC messages;

\- clause 9 specifies the specified and default radio configurations;

\- clause 10 specifies generic error handling;

\- clause 11 specifies the RRC messages transferred across network
nodes;

\- clause 12 specifies the UE capability related constraints and
performance requirements.

4.2 Architecture
----------------

### 4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT

A UE is either in RRC\_CONNECTED state or in RRC\_INACTIVE state when an
RRC connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no
RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC\_IDLE state. The RRC
states can further be characterised as follows:

**- RRC\_IDLE**:

\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;

\- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;

\- The UE:

\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause
6.5);

\- Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI;

\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;

\- Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured).

**- RRC\_INACTIVE**:

\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;

\- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;

\- The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;

\- A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;

The UE:

\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause
6.5);

\- Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN
paging using fullI-RNTI;

\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;

\- Performs RAN-based notification area updates periodically and when
moving outside the configured RAN-based notification area;

\- Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured).

**- RRC\_CONNECTED:**

\- The UE stores the AS context;

\- Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;

\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;

\- For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the
SpCell, for increased bandwidth;

\- For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for
increased bandwidth;

\- Network controlled mobility within NR and to/from E-UTRA;

\- The UE:

\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause
6.5), if configured;

\- Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to
determine if data is scheduled for it;

\- Provides channel quality and feedback information;

\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;

\- Acquires system information.

Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates an overview of UE RRC state machine and state
transitions in NR. A UE has only one RRC state in NR at one time.

Figure 4.2.1-1: UE state machine and state transitions in NR

Figure 4.2.1-2 illustrates an overview of UE state machine and state
transitions in NR as well as the mobility procedures supported between
NR/5GC E-UTRA/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC.

E-UTRA/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC

### 4.2.2 Signalling radio bearers

\"Signalling Radio Bearers\" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RBs)
that are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More
specifically, the following SRBs are defined:

\- SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;

\- SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS
message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2,
all using DCCH logical channel;

\- SRB2 is for NAS messages, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a
lower priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS
security activation;

\- SRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC,
all using DCCH logical channel.

In downlink, piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant
(i.e. with joint success/failure) procedure: bearer
establishment/modification/release. In uplink piggybacking of NAS
message is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during
connection setup and connection resume.

NOTE 1: The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC
messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control
information.

Once AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2 and SRB3,
including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and
ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and
ciphering to the NAS messages, see TS 24.501 \[23\].

Split SRB is supported for all the MR-DC options in both SRB1 and SRB2
(split SRB is not supported for SRB0 and SRB3).

4.3 Services
------------

### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers

The RRC protocol offers the following services to upper layers:

\- Broadcast of common control information;

\- Notification of UEs in RRC\_IDLE, e.g. about a mobile terminating
call;

\- Notification of UEs about ETWS and/or CMAS

5 Procedures
============

5.1 General
-----------

### 5.1.1 Introduction

This clause covers the general requirements.

### 5.1.2 General requirements

The UE shall:

1\> process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the
processing of a message shall be completed before starting the
processing of a subsequent message;

NOTE: Network may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the
UE\'s response of a previously initiated procedure.

1\> within a clause execute the steps according to the order specified
in the procedural description;

1\> consider the term \'radio bearer\' (RB) to cover SRBs and DRBs
unless explicitly stated otherwise;

1\> set the *rrc-TransactionIdentifier* in the response message, if
included, to the same value as included in the message received from the
network that triggered the response message;

1\> upon receiving a choice value set to *setup*:

2\> apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the
associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;

1\> upon receiving a choice value set to *release*:

2\> clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated
resources;

1\> in case the size of a list is extended, upon receiving an extension
field comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the
original field (regardless of whether the network signals more entries
in total); apply the following generic behaviour unless explicitly
stated otherwise:

2\> create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries
included in the extension field to the original field while maintaining
the order among both the original and the additional entries;

2\> for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the
same behaviour as defined for the original field.

### 5.1.3 Requirements for UE in MR-DC

In this specification, the UE considers itself to be in:

\- EN-DC, if and only if it is configured with
*nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig* according to TS 36.331\[10\], and it is
connected to EPC,

\- NGEN-DC, if and only if it is configured with
*nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig* according to TS 36.331\[10\], and it is
connected to 5GC,

\- NE-DC, if and only if it is configured with *mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup*
set to *eutra-SCG*,

\- NR-DC, if and only if it is configured with *mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup*
set to *nr-SCG*,

\- MR-DC, if and only if it is in (NG)EN-DC, NE-DC or NR-DC.

NOTE: This use of these terms deviates from the definition in TS 37.340
\[41\] and other specifications. In TS 37.340, these terms include also
the case where the UE is configured with E-UTRA or NR MCG only (i.e. no
NR or E-UTRA SCG) but with one or more bearers terminated in a secondary
node (i.e. using NR PDCP).

The UE in (NG)EN-DC only executes a subclause of clause 5 in this
specification when the subclause:

\- is referred to from a subclause under execution, either in this
specification or in TS 36.331 \[10\]; or

\- applies to a message received on SRB3 (if SRB3 is established); or

\- applies to field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s) or timer(s) in this
specification that the UE is configured with.

When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE
follows the requirements in clause 5.1.2 and in all subclauses of this
specification applicable to the messages (including processing time
requirements), fields, IEs, timers and UE variables indicated in the
subclause under execution.

5.2 System information
----------------------

### 5.2.1 Introduction

System Information (SI) is divided into the *MIB* and a number of SIBs
where:

\- the *MIB* is always transmitted on the BCH with a periodicity of 80
ms and repetitions made within 80 ms (TS 38.212 \[17\], clause 7.1) and
it includes parameters that are needed to acquire *SIB1* from the cell.
The first transmission of the *MIB* is scheduled in subframes as defined
in TS 38.213 \[13\], clause 4.1 and repetitions are scheduled according
to the period of SSB;

NOTE 1: If the period of SSB is larger than 80 ms, the *MIB* is
transmitted with the same periodicity as that of SSB.

\- the *SIB1* is transmitted on the DL-SCH with a periodicity of 160 ms
and variable transmission repetition periodicity within 160 ms as
specified in TS 38.213 \[13\], clause 13. The default transmission
repetition periodicity of *SIB1* is 20 ms but the actual transmission
repetition periodicity is up to network implementation. For SSB and
CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, *SIB1* repetition transmission period is
20 ms. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2/3, *SIB1* transmission
repetition period is the same as the SSB period (TS 38.213 \[13\],
clause 13). *SIB1* includes information regarding the availability and
scheduling (e.g. mapping of SIBs to SI message, periodicity, SI-window
size) of other SIBs with an indication whether one or more SIBs are only
provided on-demand and, in that case, the configuration needed by the UE
to perform the SI request. *SIB1* is cell-specific SIB;

\- SIBs other than *SIB1* are carried in *SystemInformation* (SI)
messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Only SIBs having the same
periodicity can be mapped to the same SI message. Each SI message is
transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred
to as SI-windows with same length for all SI messages). Each SI message
is associated with an SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI
messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the
corresponding SI message is transmitted. An *SI message may be
transmitted a number of times within the SI-window.* Any SIB except
*SIB1* can be configured to be cell specific or area specific, using an
indication in *SIB1*. The cell specific SIB is applicable only within a
cell that provides the SIB while the area specific SIB is applicable
within an area referred to as SI area, which consists of one or several
cells and is identified by s*ystemInformationAreaID*;

\- The mapping of SIBs to SI messages is configured in
*schedulingInfoList* with restrictions that each SIB is contained only
in a single SI message and each SIB is contained at most once in that SI
message;

\- For a UE in RRC\_CONNECTED, the network can provide system
information through dedicated signalling using the ***RRCReconfiguration
message, e.g. if the UE has an active BWP with no common search space
configured to monitor system information or paging***.

\- For PSCell and SCells, the network provides the required SI by
dedicated signalling, i.e. within an ***RRCReconfiguration message***.
Nevertheless, the UE shall acquire *MIB* of the PSCell to get SFN timing
of the SCG (which may be different from MCG). Upon change of relevant SI
for SCell, the network releases and adds the concerned SCell. For
PSCell, the required SI can only be changed with Reconfiguration with
Sync.

NOTE 2: The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can
take. The maximum *SIB1* or *SI message* size is 2976 bits.

### 5.2.2 System information acquisition

#### 5.2.2.1 General UE requirements

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition

The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS- and NAS
information. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC\_IDLE, in RRC\_INACTIVE
and in RRC\_CONNECTED.

The UE in RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid
version of (at least) the *MIB*, *SIB1* through *SIB4* and *SIB5* (if
the UE supports E-UTRA).

#### 5.2.2.2 SIB validity and need to (re)-acquire SIB

##### 5.2.2.2.1 SIB validity

The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause
5.2.2.3 upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection,
return from out of coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion,
after entering the network from another RAT, upon receiving an
indication that the system information has changed, upon receiving a PWS
notification; and whenever the UE does not have a valid version of a
stored SIB.

When the UE acquires a *MIB* or a *SIB1* or an SI message in a serving
cell as described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired
SIB, then the UE shall store the associated *areaScope*, if present, the
first *PLMN-Identity* in the *PLMN-IdentityInfoList*, the
*cellIdentity*, the *systemInformationAreaID*, if present, and the
*valueTag*, if present, as indicated in the *si-SchedulingInfo* for the
SIB. The UE may use a valid stored version of the SI except *MIB*,
*SIB1*, *SIB6*, *SIB7* or *SIB8* e.g. after cell re-selection, upon
return from out of coverage or after the reception of SI change
indication.

NOTE: The storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the
SIBs valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.

The UE shall:

1\> delete any stored version of a SIB after 3 hours from the moment it
was successfully confirmed as valid;

1\> for each stored version of a SIB:

2\> if the *areaScope* is associated and its value for the stored
version of the SIB is the same as the value received in the
*si-SchedulingInfo* for that SIB from the serving cell:

3\> if the first *PLMN-Identity* included in the
*PLMN-IdentityInfoList*, the *systemInformationAreaID* and the
v*alueTag* that are included in the *si-SchedulingInfo* for the SIB
received from the serving cell are identical to the *PLMN-Identity*, the
*systemInformationAreaID* and the *valueTag* associated with the stored
version of that SIB:

4\> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;

2\> if the *areaScope* is not present for the stored version of the SIB
and the *areaScope* value is not included in the *si-SchedulingInfo* for
that SIB from the serving cell:

3\> if the first *PLMN-Identity* in the *PLMN-IdentityInfoList,* the
*cellIdentity* and *valueTag* that are included in the
*si-SchedulingInfo* for the SIB received from the serving cell are
identical to the *PLMN-Identity,* the *cellIdentity* and the *valueTag*
associated with the stored version of that SIB:

4\> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;

##### 5.2.2.2.2 SI change indication and PWS notification

A modification period is used, i.e. updated SI (other than for ETWS and
CMAS) is broadcasted in the modification period following the one where
SI change indication is transmitted. The modification period boundaries
are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m = 0, where m is the number
of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification
period is configured by system information. The UE receives indications
about SI modifications and/or PWS notifications using Short Message
transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). Repetitions of SI
change indication may occur within preceding modification period.

UEs in RRC\_IDLE or in RRC\_INACTIVE shall monitor for SI change
indication in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. UEs in
RRC\_CONNECTED shall monitor for SI change indication in any paging
occasion at least once per modification period if the UE is provided
with common search space on the active BWP to monitor paging, as
specified in TS 38.213 \[13\], clause 13.

ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC\_IDLE or in RRC\_INACTIVE shall monitor
for indications about PWS notification in its own paging occasion every
DRX cycle. ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED shall monitor for
indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once
every *defaultPagingCycle* if the UE is provided with common search
space on the active BWP to monitor paging.

For Short Message reception in a paging occasion, the UE monitors the
PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for paging as specified in TS 38.304 \[20\]
and TS 38.213 \[13\].

If the UE receives a Short Message, the UE shall:

1\> if the UE is ETWS capable or CMAS capable, the
*etwsAndCmasIndication* bit of Short Message is set, and the UE is
provided with *searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation* on the active BWP or
the initial BWP:

2\> immediately re-acquire the *SIB1*;

2\> if the UE is ETWS capable and *si-SchedulingInfo* includes
scheduling information for *SIB6*:

3\> acquire *SIB6*, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;

2\> if the UE is ETWS capable and *si-SchedulingInfo* includes
scheduling information for *SIB7*:

3\> acquire *SIB7*, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;

2\> if the UE is CMAS capable and *si-SchedulingInfo* includes
scheduling information for *SIB8*:

3\> acquire *SIB8*, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;

NOTE: In case *SIB1,* *SIB6*, *SIB7*, or *SIB8* overlap with a
measurement gap it is left to UE implementation how to immediately
acquire *SIB1,* *SIB6*, *SIB7*, or *SIB8*.

1\> if the *systemInfoModification* bit of Short Message is set:

2\> apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from
the start of the next modification period.

#### 5.2.2.3 Acquisition of System Information

##### 5.2.2.3.1 Acquisition of *MIB* and *SIB1*

The UE shall:

1\> apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;

1\> if the UE is in RRC\_IDLE or in RRC\_INACTIVE; or

1\> if the UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED while T311 is running:

2\> acquire the *MIB,* which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213
\[13\];

2\> if the UE is unable to acquire the *MIB*;

3\> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;

2\> else:

3\> perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1.

1\> if the UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search
space configured by *searchSpaceSIB1* and *pagingSearchSpace* and has
received an indication about change of system information; or

1\> if the UE is in RRC\_IDLE or in RRC\_INACTIVE; or

1\> if the UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED while T311 is running:

2\> if *ssb-SubcarrierOffset* indicates *SIB1* is transmitted in the
cell (TS 38.213 \[13\]) and if *SIB1* acquisition is required for the
UE:

3\> acquire the *SIB1,* which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213
\[13\];

3\> if the UE is unable to acquire the *SIB1*:

4\> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;

3\> else:

4\> upon acquiring *SIB1*, perform the actions specified in clause
5.2.2.4.2.

2\> else if *SIB1* acquisition is required for the UE and
*ssb-SubcarrierOffset* indicates that *SIB1* is not scheduled in the
cell:

3\> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.

NOTE: The UE in RRC\_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted
*SIB1* if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data
reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.

##### 5.2.2.3.2 Acquisition of an SI message

For SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined
according to *searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation*. If
*searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation* is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring
occasions for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH
monitoring occasions for *SIB1* where the mapping between PDCCH
monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213\[13\]. If
*searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation* is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring
occasions for SI message are determined based on search space indicated
by *searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation*. PDCCH monitoring occasions for
SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined
according to *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*) are sequentially numbered
from one in the SI window. The \[x×N+K\]^th^ PDCCH monitoring occasion
(s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the K^th^ transmitted
SSB, where x = 0, 1, \...X-1, K = 1, 2, ...N, N is the number of actual
transmitted SSBs determined according to *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in
*SIB1* and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in
SI-window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from
one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the
SI window, PDCCH for an SI message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH
monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the
selection of SSB for the reception SI messages is up to UE
implementation.

When acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:

1\> determine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as
follows:

2\> for the concerned SI message, determine the number *n* which
corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured
by *schedulingInfoList* in *si-SchedulingInfo* in *SIB1*;

2\> determine the integer value *x = (n -- 1) × w*, where *w* is the
*si-WindowLength*;

2\> the SI-window starts at the slot \#*a*, where *a* = *x* mod N, in
the radio frame for which SFN mod *T* = FLOOR(*x*/N), where *T* is the
*si-Periodicity* of the concerned SI message and N is the number of
slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.211 \[16\];

1\> receive the PDCCH containing the scheduling RNTI, i.e. SI-RNTI in
the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for SI message acquisition, from the
start of the SI-window and continue until the end of the SI-window whose
absolute length in time is given by *si-WindowLength*, or until the SI
message was received;

1\> if the SI message was not received by the end of the SI-window,
repeat reception at the next SI-window occasion for the concerned SI
message in the current modification period;

NOTE 1: The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SI message if the
UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the
broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.

NOTE 2: The UE is not required to monitor PDCCH monitoring occasion(s)
corresponding to each transmitted SSB in SI-window.

NOTE 3: If the concerned SI message was not received in the current
modification period, handling of SI message acquisition is left to UE
implementation.

1\> perform the actions for the acquired SI message as specified in
clause 5.2.2.4.

##### 5.2.2.3.3 Request for on demand system information

The UE shall:

1\> if *SIB1* includes *si-SchedulingInfo* containing
*si-RequestConfigSUL* and criteria to select supplementary uplink as
defined in TS 38.321 \[3\], clause 5.1.1 is met:

2\> trigger the lower layer to initiate the Random Access procedure on
supplementary uplink in accordance with \[3\] using the PRACH
preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in *si-RequestConfigSUL* corresponding
to the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate within the cell,
and for which *si-BroadcastStatus* is set to *notBroadcasting*;

2\> if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:

3\> acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2,
immediately;

1\> else if *SIB1* includes *si-SchedulingInfo* containing

38.321 \[3\], clause 5.1.1 is met:

2\> trigger the lower layer to initiate the random access procedure on
normal uplink in accordance with TS 38.321 \[3\] using the PRACH
preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in *si-RequestConfig* corresponding to
the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate within the cell, and
for which *si-BroadcastStatus* is set to *notBroadcasting*;

2\> if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:

3\> acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2,

2\> apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;

2\> initiate transmission of the *RRCSystemInfoRequest* message in
accordance with 5.2.2.3.4;

2\> if acknowledgement for *RRCSystemInfoRequest* message is received
from lower layers:

3\> acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2,
immediately;

1\> if cell reselection occurs while waiting for the acknowledgment for
SI request from lower layers:

2\> reset MAC;

2\> if SI request is based on *RRCSystemInfoRequest* message:

3\> release RLC entity for SRB0.

NOTE: After RACH failure for SI request it is up to UE implementation
when to retry the SI request.

##### 5.2.2.3.4 Actions related to transmission of *RRCSystemInfoRequest* message

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSystemInfoRequest* message as
follows:

1\> set the *requested-SI-List* to indicate the SI message(s) that the
UE requires to operate within the cell, and for which
*si-BroadcastStatus* is set to *notBroadcasting*.

The UE shall submit the *RRCSystemInfoRequest* message to lower layers
for transmission.

#### 5.2.2.4 Actions upon receipt of System Information

##### 5.2.2.4.1 Actions upon reception of the *MIB*

Upon receiving the *MIB* the UE shall:

1\> store the acquired *MIB*;

5.3 Connection control
----------------------

### 5.3.1 Introduction

#### 5.3.1.1 RRC connection control

RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. The
network completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the
establishment of the NG connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE
context information from the 5GC. Consequently, AS security is not
activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this
initial phase of the RRC connection, the network may configure the UE to
perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding
measurement reports after successful AS security activation. However,
the UE only accepts a re-configuration with sync message when AS
security has been activated.

Upon receiving the UE context from the 5GC, the RAN activates AS
security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial AS
security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate AS security
(command and successful response) are integrity protected, while
ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is,
the response to the message used to activate AS security is not
ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2 and
DRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered. After having initiated
the initial AS security activation procedure, the network may initiate
the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs, i.e. the network may do this prior
to receiving the confirmation of the initial AS security activation from
the UE. In any case, the network will apply both ciphering and integrity
protection for the RRC reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2
and DRBs. The network should release the RRC connection if the initial
AS security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails. A
configuration with SRB2 without DRB or with DRB without SRB2 is not
supported (i.e., SRB2 and at least one DRB must be configured in the
same RRC Reconfiguration message, and it is not allowed to release all
the DRBs without releasing the RRC Connection).

The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network.
The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an
E-UTRA carrier frequency.

The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When
the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS
context and any configuration received from the network, and transits to
RRC\_INACTIVE state. If the UE is configured with SCG, the UE releases
the SCG configuration upon initiating a RRC Connection Resume procedure.
The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and
ciphered.

The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper
layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC\_INACTIVE state to
RRC\_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN
paging from NG-RAN. When the RRC connection is resumed, network
configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based
on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received
from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates AS
security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s).

In response to a request to resume the RRC connection, the network may
resume the suspended RRC connection and send UE to RRC\_CONNECTED, or
reject the request to resume and send UE to RRC\_INACTIVE (with a wait
timer), or directly re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to
RRC\_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection and send UE to
RRC\_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery (in this
case the network sends an RRC setup message).

#### 5.3.1.2 AS Security

AS security comprises of the integrity protection and ciphering of RRC
signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).

RRC handles the configuration of the AS security parameters which are
part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the
ciphering algorithm, if integrity protection and/or ciphering is enabled
for a DRB and two parameters, namely the *keySetChangeIndicator* and the
*nextHopChainingCount*, which are used by the UE to determine the AS
security keys upon reconfiguration with sync (with key change),
connection re-establishment and/or connection resume.

The integrity protection algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if
configured) and DRBs configured with integrity protection, with the same
*keyToUse* value. The ciphering algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3
(if configured) and DRBs configured with the same *keyToUse* value. For
MR-DC, integrity protection is not enabled for DRBs terminated in eNB.
Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.

NOTE 0: All DRBs related to the same PDU session have the same
enable/disable setting for ciphering and the same enable/disable setting
for integrity protection, as specified in TS 33.501 \[11\].

RRC integrity protection and ciphering are always activated together,
i.e. in one message/procedure. RRC integrity protection and ciphering
for SRBs are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a
\'*NULL*\' ciphering algorithm (*nea0*).

The \'*NULL*\' integrity protection algorithm (*nia0*) is used only for
SRBs and for the UE in limited service mode, see TS 33.501 \[11\] and
when used for SRBs, integrity protection is disabled for DRBs. In case
the ′*NULL*\' integrity protection algorithm is used, \'*NULL*\'
ciphering algorithm is also used.

NOTE 1: Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity
protection check has failed and indicate the integrity protection
verification check failure to RRC.

The AS applies four different security keys: one for the integrity
protection of RRC signalling (K~RRCint~), one for the ciphering of RRC
signalling (K~RRCenc~), one for integrity protection of user data
(K~UPint~) and one for the ciphering of user data (K~UPenc~). All four
AS keys are derived from the K~gNB~ key. The K~gNB~ key is based on the
K~AMF~ key (as specified in TS 33.501 \[11\]), which is handled by upper
layers.

The integrity protection and ciphering algorithms can only be changed
with reconfiguration with sync. The AS keys (K~gNB~, K~RRCint~,
K~RRCenc~, K~UPint~ and K~UPenc~) change upon reconfiguration with sync
(if *masterKeyUpdate* is included), and upon connection re-establishment
and connection resume.

For each radio bearer an independent counter (*COUNT*, as specified in
TS 38.323 \[5\]) is maintained for each direction. For each radio
bearer, the *COUNT* is used as input for ciphering and integrity
protection.

It is not allowed to use the same *COUNT* value more than once for a
given security key. As specified in TS 33.501 \[11\], clause 6.9.4.1,
the network is responsible for avoiding reuse of the *COUNT* with the
same RB identity and with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of
large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and
multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers and multiple
termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN terminated PDCP
re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full configuration whilst
the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at MN have not been
updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g. use
different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security
key, or an RRC\_CONNECTED to RRC\_IDLE/RRC\_INACTIVE and then to
RRC\_CONNECTED transition.

In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets
include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 38.323
\[5\]). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper
frame number (*HFN*, as specified in TS 38.323 \[5\]). The HFN needs to
be synchronized between the UE and the network.

For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the
5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity
protection is the value of the corresponding *srb-Identity* with the
MSBs padded with zeroes.

For a UE provided with an *sk-counter*, *keyToUse* indicates whether the
UE uses the master key (K~gNB~) or the secondary key (S-K~eNB~ or
S-K~gNB~) for a particular DRB. The secondary key is derived from the
master key and *sk-Counter*, as defined in TS 33.501\[11\]. Whenever
there is a need to refresh the secondary key, e.g. upon change of MN
with K~gNB~ change or to avoid COUNT reuse, the security key update is
used (see 5.3.5.7). When the UE is in NR-DC, the network may provide a
UE configured with an SCG with an *sk-Counter* even when no DRB is setup
using the secondary key (S-K~gNB~) in order to allow the configuration
of SRB3. The network can also provide the UE with an *sk-Counter*, even
if no SCG is configured, when using SN terminated MCG bearers.

### 5.3.2 Paging

#### 5.3.2.1 General

Figure 5.3.2.1-1: Paging

The purpose of this procedure is:

\- to transmit paging information to a UE in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE.

#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation

The network initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the *Paging*
message at the UE\'s paging occasion as specified in TS 38.304 \[20\].
The network may address multiple UEs within a *Paging* message by
including one *PagingRecord* for each UE.

#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of the *Paging* *message* by the UE

Upon receiving the *Paging* message, the UE shall:

1\> if in RRC\_IDLE, for each of the *PagingRecord*, if any, included in
the *Paging* message:

2\> if the *ue-Identity* included in the *PagingRecord* matches the UE
identity allocated by upper layers:

3\> forward the *ue-Identity* and *accessType* (if present) to the upper
layers;

1\> if in RRC\_INACTIVE, for each of the *PagingRecord*, if any,
included in the *Paging* message:

2\> if the *ue-Identity* included in the *PagingRecord* matches the
UE\'s stored *fullI-RNTI*:

3\> if the UE is configured by upper layers with Access Identity 1:

4\> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13
with *resumeCause* set to *mps-PriorityAccess*;

3\> else if the UE is configured by upper layers with Access Identity 2:

4\> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13
with *resumeCause* set to *mcs-PriorityAccess*;

3\> else if the UE is configured by upper layers with one or more Access
Identities equal to 11-15:

4\> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13
with *resumeCause* set to *highPriorityAccess*;

3\> else:

4\> initiate the RRC connection resumption procedure according to 5.3.13
with *resumeCause* set to *mt-Access*;

2\> else if the *ue-Identity* included in the *PagingRecord* matches the
UE identity allocated by upper layers:

3\> forward the *ue-Identity* to upper layers and *accessType* (if
present) to the upper layers;

3\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11
with release cause \'other\'.

### 5.3.3 RRC connection establishment

#### 5.3.3.1 General

Figure 5.3.3.1-1: RRC connection establishment, successful

Figure 5.3.3.1-2: RRC connection establishment, network reject

The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection. RRC
connection establishment involves SRB1 establishment. The procedure is
also used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/ message
from the UE to the network.

The network applies the procedure e.g.as follows:

\- When establishing an RRC connection;

\- When UE is resuming or re-establishing an RRC connection, and the
network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context. In this case,
UE receives *RRCSetup* and responds with *RRCSetupComplete*.

#### 5.3.3.2 Initiation

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers request establishment
of an RRC connection while the UE is in RRC\_IDLE and it has acquired
essential system information.

The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system
information as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this
procedure.

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon requesting establishment of an RRC connection:

2\> perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14
using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper
layers;

3\> if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;

1\> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values
are provided in *SIB1*;

1\> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in
9.2.2;

1\> apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;

1\> apply the *timeAlignmentTimerCommon* included in *SIB1*;

1\> start timer T300;

1\> initiate transmission of the *RRCSetupRequest* message in accordance
with 5.3.3.3;

#### 5.3.3.3 Actions related to transmission of *RRCSetupRequest* message

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

1\> set the *ue-Identity* as follows:

2\> if upper layers provide a 5G-S-TMSI:

3\> set the *ue-Identity* to *ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part1*;

2\> else:

3\> draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..2^39^-1 and set the
*ue-Identity* to this value;

NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the *5G-S-TMSI* if the UE is registered in
the TA of the current cell.

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

The UE shall continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as
cell re-selection evaluation. If the conditions for cell re-selection
are fulfilled, the UE shall perform cell re-selection as specified in
5.3.3.6.

#### 5.3.3.4 Reception of the *RRCSetup* by the UE

The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the
*RRCSetup*:

1\> if the *RRCSetup* is received in response to an
*RRCReestablishmentRequest*; or

1\> if the *RRCSetup* is received in response to an *RRCResumeRequest*
or *RRCResumeRequest1*:

2\> discard any stored UE Inactive AS context and *suspendConfig*;

2\> discard any current AS security context including the K~RRCenc~ key,

### 5.3.4 Initial AS security activation

#### 5.3.4.1 General

Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Security mode command, successful

Figure 5.3.4.1-2: Security mode command, failure

The purpose of this procedure is to activate AS security upon RRC
connection establishment.

#### 5.3.4.2 Initiation

The network initiates the security mode command procedure to a UE in
RRC\_CONNECTED. Moreover, the network applies the procedure as follows:

\- when only SRB1 is established, i.e. prior to establishment of SRB2
and/ or DRBs.

#### 5.3.4.3 Reception of the *SecurityModeCommand* by the UE

The UE shall:

1\> derive the K~gNB~ key, as specified in TS 33.501 \[11\];

1\> derive the K~RRCint~ key associated with the
*integrityProtAlgorithm* indicated in the *SecurityModeCommand* message,
as specified in TS 33.501 \[11\];

1\> request lower layers to verify the integrity protection of the
*SecurityModeCommand* message, using the algorithm indicated by the
*integrityProtAlgorithm* as included in the *SecurityModeCommand*
message and the K~RRCint~ key;

1\> if the *SecurityModeCommand* message passes the integrity protection
check:

2\> derive the K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key associated with the
*cipheringAlgorithm* indicated in the *SecurityModeCommand* message, as
specified in TS 33.501 \[11\];

2\> derive the K~UPint~ key associated with the *integrityProtAlgorithm*
indicated in the *SecurityModeCommand* message, as specified in TS
33.501 \[11\];

2\> configure lower layers to apply SRB integrity protection using the
indicated algorithm and the K~RRCint~ key immediately, i.e. integrity
protection shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent
by the UE, including the *SecurityModeComplete* message;

2\> configure lower layers to apply SRB ciphering using the indicated
algorithm, the K~RRCenc~ keyafter completing the procedure, i.e.
ciphering shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent
by the UE, except for the *SecurityModeComplete* message which is sent
unciphered;

2\> consider AS security to be activated;

2\> submit the *SecurityModeComplete* message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> continue using the configuration used prior to the reception of the
*SecurityModeCommand* message, i.e. neither apply integrity protection
nor ciphering.

2\> submit the *SecurityModeFailure* message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends.

### 5.3.5 RRC reconfiguration

#### 5.3.5.1 General

Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC reconfiguration, successful

Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure

The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to
establish/modify/release RBs, to perform reconfiguration with sync, to
setup/modify/release measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and cell
groups. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be
transferred from the Network to the UE.

RRC reconfiguration to perform reconfiguration with sync includes, but
is not limited to, the following cases:

\- reconfiguration with sync and security key refresh, involving RA to
the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset, refresh of security and re-establishment of
RLC and PDCP triggered by explicit indicators;

\- reconfiguration with sync but without security key refresh, involving
RA to the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset and RLC re-establishment and PDCP data
recovery (for AM DRB) triggered by explicit indicators.

In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration
and reporting, to (re-)configure MAC, RLC, physical layer and RLF timers
and constants of the SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs
associated with the S-K~gNB~ or SRB3, and to reconfigure SDAP for DRBs
associated with S-K~gNB~ in NGEN-DC and NR-DC, provided that the
(re-)configuration does not require any MN involvement. In (NG)EN-DC and
NR-DC, only *measConfig*, *radioBearerConfig* and/or
*secondaryCellGroup* are included in *RRCReconfiguration* received via
SRB3.

#### 5.3.5.2 Initiation

The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in
RRC\_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:

\- the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during
RRC connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has
been activated;

\- the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only
when AS security has been activated;

\- the *reconfigurationWithSync* is included in *secondaryCellGroup*
only when at least one RLC bearer is setup in SCG;

\- the *reconfigurationWithSync* is included in *masterCellGroup* only
when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB have
been setup and not suspended.

#### 5.3.5.3 Reception of an *RRCReconfiguration* by the UE

in TS 36.331 \[10\];

3\> if *reconfigurationWithSync* was included in *spCellConfig* of an
SCG:

4\> initiate the Random Access procedure on the SpCell, as specified in
TS 38.321 \[3\];

3\> else:

4\> the procedure ends;

NOTE 1: The order the UE sends the
*RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete* message and performs the Random
Access procedure towards the SCG is left to UE implementation.

2\> else (*RRCReconfiguration* was received via SRB3):

3\> submit the *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message via SRB3 to lower
layers for transmission using the new configuration;

NOTE 2: In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, in the case *RRCReconfiguration* is
received via SRB1, the random access is triggered by RRC layer itself as
there is not necessarily other UL transmission. In the case
*RRCReconfiguration* is received via SRB3, the random access is
triggered by the MAC layer due to arrival of
*RRCReconfigurationComplete*.

1\> else if the *RRCReconfiguration* message was received within the
*nr-SCG* within *mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup* (UE in NR-DC,
*mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup* was received in *RRCReconfiguration* via
SRB1):

2\> if *reconfigurationWithSync* was included in *spCellConfig* in
*nr-SCG*:

3\> initiate the Random Access procedure on the PSCell, as specified in

layers for transmission using the new configuration;

1\> else *(RRCReconfiguration* was received via SRB1*)*:

2\> submit the *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message via SRB1 to lower
layers for transmission using the new configuration;

2\> if this is the first *RRCReconfiguration* message after successful
completion of the RRC re-establishment procedure:

3\> resume SRB2 and DRBs that are suspended;

1\> if *reconfigurationWithSync* was included in *spCellConfig* of an
MCG or SCG, and when MAC of an NR cell group successfully completes a
Random Access procedure triggered above;

2\> stop timer T304 for that cell group;

2\> apply the parts of the CSI reporting configuration, the scheduling
request configuration and the sounding RS configuration that do not
require the UE to know the SFN of the respective target SpCell, if any;

2\> apply the parts of the measurement and the radio resource
configuration that require the UE to know the SFN of the respective
target SpCell (e.g. measurement gaps, periodic CQI reporting, scheduling
request configuration, sounding RS configuration), if any, upon
acquiring the SFN of that target SpCell;

2\> if the *reconfigurationWithSync* was included in *spCellConfig* of
an MCG:

3\> if T390 is running:

4\> stop timer T390 for all access categories;

*firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* for the target SpCell of the MCG, has a
common search space configured by *searchSpaceSIB1*:

4\> acquire the *SIB1*, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213
\[13\], of the target SpCell of the MCG;

4\> upon acquiring *SIB1*, perform the actions specified in clause
5.2.2.4.2;

2\> if *reconfigurationWithSync* was included in *masterCellGroup*; and

2\> if the UE initiated transmission of a *UEAssistanceInformation*
message during the last 1 second, and the UE is still configured to
provide the concerned UE assistance information:

3\> initiate transmission of a *UEAssistanceInformation* message in
accordance with clause 5.7.4.3 to provide the concerned UE assistance
information;

3\> start or restart the prohibit timer (if exists) associated with the
concerned UE assistance information with the timer value set to the
value in corresponding configuration;

2\> the procedure ends.

NOTE 3: The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted *SIB1* if the UE
can acquire it without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the
broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.

NOTE 4: The UE sets the content of *UEAssistanceInformation* according
to latest configuration (i.e. the configuration after applying the
*RRCReconfiguration* message) and latest UE preference. The UE may
include more than the concerned UE assistance information within the
*UEAssistanceInformation* according to 5.7.4.2. Therefore, the content
of *UEAssistanceInformation* message might not be the same as the
content of the previous *UEAssistanceInformation* message.

#### 5.3.5.4 Secondary cell group release

The UE shall:

1\> as a result of SCG release triggered by E-UTRA (i.e. (NG)EN-DC case)
or NR (i.e. NR-DC case):

2\> release the SCG configuration;

2\> stop timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;

2\> stop timer T304 for the corresponding SpCell, if running.

NOTE: Release of cell group means only release of the lower layer
configuration of the cell group but the *RadioBearerConfig* may not be
released.

#### 5.3.5.5 Cell Group configuration

##### 5.3.5.5.1 General

The network configures the UE with Master Cell Group (MCG), and zero or
one Secondary Cell Group (SCG). In (NG)EN-DC, the MCG is configured as
specified in TS 36.331 \[10\], and for NE-DC, the SCG is configured as
specified in TS 36.331 \[10\]. The network provides the configuration
parameters for a cell group in the *CellGroupConfig* IE.

The UE performs the following actions based on a received
*CellGroupConfig* IE:

1\> if the *CellGroupConfig* contains the *spCellConfig* with
*reconfigurationWithSync*:

2\> perform Reconfiguration with sync according to 5.3.5.5.2;

2\> resume all suspended radio bearers and resume SCG transmission for
all radio bearers, if suspended;

1\> if the *CellGroupConfig* contains the *rlc-BearerToReleaseList*:

2\> perform RLC bearer release as specified in 5.3.5.5.3;

2\> perform SCell release as specified in 5.3.5.5.8;

1\> if the *CellGroupConfig* contains the *spCellConfig*:

2\> configure the SpCell as specified in 5.3.5.5.7;

1\> if the *CellGroupConfig* contains the *sCellToAddModList*:

2\> perform SCell addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.5.9.

##### 5.3.5.5.2 Reconfiguration with sync

The UE shall perform the following actions to execute a reconfiguration
with sync.

1\> if the AS security is not activated, perform the actions upon going
to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11 with the release cause \'*other*\'
upon which the procedure ends;

1\> stop timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell, if running;

1\> start timer T304 for the corresponding SpCell with the timer value
set to *t304*, as included in the *reconfigurationWithSync*;

1\> if the *frequencyInfoDL* is included:

2\> consider the target SpCell to be one on the SSB frequency indicated
by the *frequencyInfoDL* with a physical cell identity indicated by the
*physCellId*;

1\> else:

2\> consider the target SpCell to be one on the SSB frequency of the
source SpCell with a physical cell identity indicated by the
*physCellId*;

1\> start synchronising to the DL of the target SpCell;

1\> apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;

1\> acquire the *MIB*, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213
\[13\];

NOTE 1: The UE should perform the reconfiguration with sync as soon as
possible following the reception of the RRC message triggering the
reconfiguration with sync, which could be before confirming successful
reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.

NOTE 2: The UE may omit reading the *MIB* if the UE already has the
required timing information, or the timing information is not needed for
random access.

1\> reset the MAC entity of this cell group;

1\> consider the SCell(s) of this cell group, if configured, to be in
deactivated state;

1\> apply the value of the *newUE-Identity* as the C-RNTI for this cell
group;

1\> configure lower layers in accordance with the received
s*pCellConfigCommon*;

1\> configure lower layers in accordance with any additional fields, not
covered in the previous, if included in the received
*reconfigurationWithSync.*

##### 5.3.5.5.3 RLC bearer release

The UE shall:

1\> for each *logicalChannelIdentity* value included in the
*rlc-BearerToReleaseList* that is part of the current UE configuration
within the same cell group (LCH release); or

1\> for each *logicalChannelIdentity* value that is to be released as
the result of an SCG release according to 5.3.5.4:

2\> release the RLC entity or entities as specified in TS 38.322 \[4\],
clause 5.1.3;

2\> release the corresponding logical channel.

##### 5.3.5.5.4 RLC bearer addition/modification

For each *RLC-BearerConfig* received in the *rlc-BearerToAddModList* IE
the UE shall:

1\> if the UE\'s current configuration contains an RLC bearer with the
received *logicalChannelIdentity* within the same cell group:

2\> if *reestablishRLC* is received:

3\> re-establish the RLC entity as specified in TS 38.322 \[4\];

2\> reconfigure the RLC entity or entities in accordance with the
received *rlc-Config*;

2\> reconfigure the logical channel in accordance with the received
*mac-LogicalChannelConfig*;

NOTE: The network does not re-associate an already configured logical
channel with another radio bearer. Hence *servedRadioBearer* is not
present in this case. If a radio bearer is released and another is added
with the same radio bearer identity, it is considered as a new
(different) radio bearer. Hence, the network also releases the RLC
bearer(s) associated with the released radio bearer.

1\> else (a logical channel with the given *logicalChannelIdentity* is
not configured within the same cell group, including the case when full
configuration option is used):

2\> if the *servedRadioBearer* associates the logical channel with an
SRB and *rlc-Config* is not included:

3\> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the default configuration
defined in 9.2 for the corresponding SRB;

2\> else:

3\> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the received
*rlc-Config*;

2\> if the *servedRadioBearer* associates the logical channel with an
SRB and if *mac-LogicalChannelConfig* is not included:

3\> configure this MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance to
the default configuration defined in 9.2 for the corresponding SRB;

2\> else:

3\> configure this MAC entity with a logical channel in accordance to
the received *mac-LogicalChannelConfig*;

2\> associate this logical channel with the PDCP entity identified by
*servedRadioBearer*.

##### 5.3.5.5.5 MAC entity configuration

The UE shall:

1\> if SCG MAC is not part of the current UE configuration (i.e. SCG
establishment):

2\> create an SCG MAC entity;

1\> reconfigure the MAC main configuration of the cell group in
accordance with the received *mac-CellGroupConfig* excluding
*tag-ToReleaseList* and *tag-ToAddModList*;

1\> if the received *mac-CellGroupConfig* includes the
*tag-ToReleaseList*:

NOTE 1: Void.

NOTE 2: When determining whether a *drb-Identity* value is part of the
current UE configuration, the UE does not distinguish which
*RadioBearerConfig* and *DRB-ToAddModList* that DRB was originally
configured in. To re-associate a DRB with a different key (K~eNB~ to
S-K~gNB~, K~gNB~ to S-K~eNB~, K~gNB~ to S-K~gNB~, or vice versa), the
network provides the *drb-Identity* value in the (target)
*drb-ToAddModList* and sets the *reestablishPDCP* flag. The network does
not list the *drb-Identity* in the (source) *drb-ToReleaseList*.

NOTE 3: When setting the *reestablishPDCP* flag for a radio bearer, the
network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP
PDUs to the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering
a reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity
or by releasing the old RLC entity.

NOTE 4: In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters
configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.

NOTE 5: Ciphering and integrity protection can be enabled or disabled
for a DRB. The enabling/disabling of ciphering or integrity protection
can be changed only by releasing and adding the DRB.

4\> derive the K~RRCint~ and K~UPint~ keys associated with the
*integrityProtAlgorithm* indicated in the *securityAlgorithmConfig,* as
specified in TS 33.501 \[11\];

3\> else:

4\> derive the K~RRCint~ and K~UPint~ keys associated with the current
*integrityProtAlgorithm,* as specified in TS 33.501 \[11\].

NOTE 1: Ciphering and integrity protection are optional to configure for
the DRBs.

1\> else if this procedure was initiated due to reception of the
*sk-Counter* (UE is in NE-DC, or NR-DC, or is configured with SN
terminated bearer(s)):

NOTE 2: If the UE has no radio bearer configured with *keyToUse* set to
*secondary* and receives the *sk-Counter* without any
*RadioBearerConfig* with *keyToUse* set to *secondary*, the UE does not
consider it as an invalid reconfiguration.

2\> release SRB3, if established, as specified in 5.3.5.6.2;

2\> release *measConfig* associated with SCG;

2\> if the UE is configured with NR SCG:

3\> release the SCG configuration as specified in clause 5.3.5.4;

2\> else if the UE is configured with E-UTRA SCG:

3\> release the SCG configuration as specified in TS 36.331 \[10\],
clause 5.3.10.19 to release the E-UTRA SCG;

#### 5.3.5.11 Full configuration

The UE shall:

1\> release/ clear all current dedicated radio configurations except for
the following:

\- the MCG C-RNTI;

\- the AS security configurations associated with the master key;

\- the SRB1/SRB2 configurations and DRB configurations as configured by
*radioBearerConfig* or *radioBearerConfig2*.

NOTE 1: Radio configuration is not just the resource configuration but
includes other configurations like *MeasConfig*. Radio configuration
also includes the RLC bearer configurations as configured by
*RLC-BearerConfig*. In case NR-DC or NE-DC is configured, this also
includes the entire NR or E-UTRA SCG configuration which are released
according to the MR-DC release procedure as specified in 5.3.5.10.

NOTE 1a: To establish the RLC bearer of SRB(s) after release due to
*fullConfig*, the network can include the *srb-Identity* within
*srb-ToAddModList* (i.e. the UE applies RLC default configuration)
and/or provide *rlc-BearerToAddModList* of concerned SRB(s) explicitly.

1\> if the *spCellConfig* in the *masterCellGroup* includes the
*reconfigurationWithSync* (i.e., SpCell change):

2\> release/ clear all current common radio configurations;

2\> use the default values specified in 9.2.3 for timers T310, T311 and
constants N310, N311;

1\> else (full configuration after re-establishment or during RRC
resume):

2\> use values for timers T301, T310, T311 and constants N310, N311, as
included in *ue-TimersAndConstants* received in *SIB1*;

1\> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the following:

\- parameters for which values are provided in *SIB1*;

1\> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in
9.2.2;

1\> for each *srb-Identity* value included in the *srb-ToAddModList*
(SRB reconfiguration):

2\> establish an RLC entity for the corresponding SRB;

2\> apply the default SRB configuration defined in 9.2.1 for the
corresponding SRB;

NOTE 2: This is to get the SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2 for reconfiguration with
sync and SRB2 for resume and reconfiguration after re-establishment) to
a known state from which the reconfiguration message can do further
configuration.

1\> for each *pdu-Session* that is part of the current UE configuration:

2\> release the SDAP entity (clause 5.1.2 in TS 37.324 \[24\]);

2\> release each DRB associated to the *pdu-Session* as specified in
5.3.5.6.4;

NOTE 3: This will retain the *pdu-Session* but remove the DRBs including
*drb-identity* of these bearers from the current UE configuration. Setup
of the DRBs within the AS is described in clause 5.3.5.6.5 using the new
configuration. The *pdu-Session* acts as the anchor for associating the
released and re-setup DRB. In the AS the DRB re-setup is equivalent with
a new DRB setup (including new PDCP and logical channel configurations).

1\> for each *pdu-Session* that is part of the current UE configuration
but not added with same *pdu-Session* in the *drb-ToAddModList*:

2\> if the procedure was triggered due to reconfiguration with sync:

3\> indicate the release of the user plane resources for the
*pdu-Session* to upper layers after successful reconfiguration with
sync;

2\> else:

3\> indicate the release of the user plane resources for the
*pdu-Session* to upper layers immediately;

### 5.3.6 Counter check

#### 5.3.6.1 General

Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure

The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to
verify the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically,
the UE is requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits
of the COUNT match with the values indicated by the network.

NOTE: The procedure enables the network to detect packet insertion by an
intruder (a \'man in the middle\').

#### 5.3.6.2 Initiation

The network initiates the procedure by sending a *CounterCheck* message.

NOTE: The network may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT
values reaches a specific value.

#### 5.3.6.3 Reception of the *CounterCheck* message by the UE

Upon receiving the *CounterCheck* message, the UE shall:

1\> for each DRB that is established:

2\> if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink)
because it is a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other
direction:

3\> assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;

2\> if the *drb-Identity* is not included in the
*drb-CountMSB-InfoList*:

3\> include the DRB in the *drb-CountInfoList* in the
*CounterCheckResponse* message by including the *drb-Identity*, the
*count-Uplink* and the *count-Downlink* set to the value of TX\_NEXT --
1 and RX\_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS 38.323 \[5\]), respectively;

2\> else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of
the COUNT are different from the value indicated in the
*drb-CountMSB-InfoList*:

3\> include the DRB in the *drb-CountInfoList* in the
*CounterCheckResponse* message by including the *drb-Identity*, the
*count-Uplink* and the *count-Downlink* set to the value of TX\_NEXT --
1 and RX\_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS 38.323 \[5\]), respectively;

1\> for each DRB that is included in the *drb-CountMSB-InfoList* in the
*CounterCheck* message that is not established:

2\> include the DRB in the *drb-CountInfoList* in the
*CounterCheckResponse* message by including the *drb-Identity*, the
*count-Uplink* and the *count-Downlink* with the most significant bits
set identical to the corresponding values in the *drb-CountMSB-InfoList*
and the least significant bits set to zero;

1\> submit the *CounterCheckResponse* message to lower layers for
transmission upon which the procedure ends.

### 5.3.7 RRC connection re-establishment

#### 5.3.7.1 General

Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful

Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC re-establishment, fallback to RRC establishment,
successful

The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A
UE in RRC\_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2
and at least one DRB setup, may initiate the procedure in order to
continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds if
the network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE
context cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an *RRCSetup*
according to clause 5.3.3.4.

The network applies the procedure e.g as follows:

\- When AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or
verifies the UE context:

\- to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;

\- to re-establish and resume the SRB1;

\- When UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not
able to retrieve or verify the UE context:

\- to discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs;

\- to fallback to establish a new RRC connection.

If AS security has not been activated, the UE shall not initiate the
procedure but instead moves to RRC\_IDLE directly, with release cause
\'other\'. If AS security has been activated, but SRB2 and at least one
DRB are not setup, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead
moves to RRC\_IDLE directly, with release cause \'RRC connection
failure\'.

#### 5.3.7.2 Initiation

The UE initiates the procedure when one of the following conditions is
met:

1\> upon detecting radio link failure of the MCG, in accordance with
5.3.10; or

1\> upon re-configuration with sync failure of the MCG, in accordance
with clause 5.3.5.8.3; or

1\> upon mobility from NR failure, in accordance with clause 5.4.3.5; or

1\> upon integrity check failure indication from lower layers concerning
SRB1 or SRB2, except if the integrity check failure is detected on the
*RRCReestablishment* message; or

1\> upon an RRC connection reconfiguration failure, in accordance with
clause 5.3.5.8.2.

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> stop timer T310, if running;

1\> stop timer T304, if running;

1\> start timer T311;

1\> suspend all RBs, except SRB0;

1\> reset MAC;

1\> release the MCG SCell(s), if configured;

1\> release *spCellConfig*, if configured;

1\> if MR-DC is configured:

2\> perform MR-DC release, as specified in clause 5.3.5.10;

1\> release *delayBudgetReportingConfig*, if configured, and stop timer
T342, if running;

1\> release *overheatingAssistanceConfig*, if configured, and stop timer
T345, if running;

1\> perform cell selection in accordance with the cell selection process
as specified in TS 38.304 \[20\].

#### 5.3.7.3 Actions following cell selection while T311 is running

Upon selecting a suitable NR cell, the UE shall:

1\> ensure having valid and up to date essential system information as
specified in clause 5.2.2.2;

1\> stop timer T311;

1\> start timer T301;

1\> if T390 is running:

2\> stop timer T390 for all access categories;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values
are provided in *SIB1*;

1\> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in
9.2.2;

1\> apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;

1\> apply the *timeAlignmentTimerCommon* included in *SIB1*;

1\> initiate transmission of the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message in
accordance with 5.3.7.4;

NOTE: This procedure applies also if the UE returns to the source PCell.

Upon selecting an inter-RAT cell, the UE shall:

1\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'RRC connection failure\'.

#### 5.3.7.4 Actions related to transmission of *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message as
follows:

1\> set the *ue-Identity* as follows:

2\> set the *c-RNTI* to the C-RNTI used in the source PCell
(reconfiguration with sync or mobility from NR failure) or used in the
PCell in which the trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other
cases);

2\> set the *physCellId* to the physical cell identity of the source
PCell (reconfiguration with sync or mobility from NR failure) or of the
PCell in which the trigger for the re-establishment occurred (other
cases);

2\> set the *shortMAC-I* to the 16 least significant bits of the MAC-I
calculated:

3\> over the ASN.1 encoded as per clause 8 (i.e., a multiple of 8 bits)
*VarShortMAC-Input*;

3\> with the K~RRCint~ key and integrity protection algorithm that was
used in the source PCell (reconfiguration with sync or mobility from NR
failure) or of the PCell in which the trigger for the re-establishment
occurred (other cases); and

3\> with all input bits for COUNT, BEARER and DIRECTION set to binary
ones;

1\> set the *reestablishmentCause* as follows:

2\> if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to
reconfiguration failure as specified in 5.3.5.8.2:

3\> set the *reestablishmentCause* to the value
*reconfigurationFailure*;

2\> else if the re-establishment procedure was initiated due to
reconfiguration with sync failure as specified in 5.3.5.8.3 (intra-NR
handover failure) or 5.4.3.5 (inter-RAT mobility from NR failure):

3\> set the *reestablishmentCause* to the value *handoverFailure*;

2\> else:

3\> set the *reestablishmentCause* to the value *otherFailure*;

1\> re-establish PDCP for SRB1;

1\> re-establish RLC for SRB1;

1\> apply the default configuration defined in 9.2.1 for SRB1;

1\> configure lower layers to suspend integrity protection and ciphering
for SRB1;

NOTE: Ciphering is not applied for the subsequent *RRCReestablishment*
message used to resume the connection. An integrity check is performed
by lower layers, but merely upon request from RRC.

1\> resume SRB1;

1\> submit the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

#### 5.3.7.5 Reception of the *RRCReestablishment* by the UE

The UE shall:

1\> stop timer T301;

1\> consider the current cell to be the PCell;

1\> store the *nextHopChainingCount* value indicated in the
*RRCReestablishment message*;

1\> update the K~gNB~ key based on the current K~gNB~ key or the NH*,*
using the stored *nextHopChainingCount* value, as specified in TS 33.501
\[11\];

1\> derive the K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ keys associated with the
previously configured *cipheringAlgorithm,* as specified in TS 33.501
\[11\];

1\> derive the K~RRCint~ and K~UPint~ keys associated with the
previously configured *integrityProtAlgorithm,* as specified in TS
33.501 \[11\].

1\> request lower layers to verify the integrity protection of the
*RRCReestablishment* message, using the previously configured algorithm
and the K~RRCint~ key;

1\> if the integrity protection check of the *RRCReestablishment*
message fails:

2\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'RRC connection failure\', upon which the procedure
ends;

1\> configure lower layers to resume integrity protection for SRB1 using
the previously configured algorithm and the K~RRCint~ key immediately,
i.e., integrity protection shall be applied to all subsequent messages
received and sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the
successful completion of the procedure;

1\> configure lower layers to resume ciphering for SRB1 using the
previously configured algorithm and, the K~RRCenc~ key immediately,
i.e., ciphering shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and
sent by the UE, including the message used to indicate the successful
completion of the procedure;

1\> release the measurement gap configuration indicated by the
*measGapConfig*, if configured;

1\> submit the *RRCReestablishmentComplete* message to lower layers for
transmission;

1\> the procedure ends.

#### 5.3.7.6 T311 expiry

Upon T311 expiry, the UE shall:

1\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'RRC connection failure\'.

#### 5.3.7.7 T301 expiry or selected cell no longer suitable

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T301 expires; or

1\> if the selected cell becomes no longer suitable according to the
cell selection criteria as specified in TS 38.304 \[20\]:

2\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'RRC connection failure\'.

#### 5.3.7.8 Reception of the *RRCSetup* by the UE

The UE shall:

1\> perform the RRC connection establishment procedure as specified in
5.3.3.4.

### 5.3.8 RRC connection release

#### 5.3.8.1 General

Figure 5.3.8.1-1: RRC connection release, successful

The purpose of this procedure is:

\- to release the RRC connection, which includes the release of the
established radio bearers as well as all radio resources; or

\- to suspend the RRC connection only if SRB2 and at least one DRB are
setup, which includes the suspension of the established radio bearers.

#### 5.3.8.2 Initiation

The network initiates the RRC connection release procedure to transit a
UE in RRC\_CONNECTED to RRC\_IDLE; or to transit a UE in RRC\_CONNECTED
to RRC\_INACTIVE only if SRB2 and at least one DRB is setup in
RRC\_CONNECTED; or to transit a UE in RRC\_INACTIVE back to
RRC\_INACTIVE when the UE tries to resume; or to transit a UE in
RRC\_INACTIVE to RRC\_IDLE when the UE tries to resume. The procedure
can also be used to release and redirect a UE to another frequency.

#### 5.3.8.3 Reception of the *RRCRelease* by the UE

The UE shall:

1\> delay the following actions defined in this clause 60 ms from the
moment the *RRCRelease* message was received or optionally when lower
layers indicate that the receipt of the *RRCRelease* message has been
successfully acknowledged, whichever is earlier;

1\> stop timer T380, if running;

1\> stop timer T320, if running;

1\> if the AS security is not activated:

2\> ignore any field included in *RRCRelease* message except *waitTime*;

2\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11
with the release cause \'other\' upon which the procedure ends;

1\> if the *RRCRelease* message includes *redirectedCarrierInfo*
indicating redirection to *eutra*:

2\> if *cnType* is included:

3\> after the cell selection, indicate the available CN Type(s) and the
received *cnType* to upper layers;

NOTE 1: Handling the case if the E-UTRA cell selected after the
redirection does not support the core network type specified by the
*cnType,* is up to UE implementation.

1\> if the *RRCRelease* message includes the
*cellReselectionPriorities*:

2\> store the cell reselection priority information provided by the
*cellReselectionPriorities*;

2\> if the *t320* is included:

3\> start timer T320, with the timer value set according to the value of
*t320*;

1\> else:

2\> apply the cell reselection priority information broadcast in the
system information;

1\> if *deprioritisationReq* is included and the UE supports RRC
connection release with deprioritisation:

2\> start or restart timer T325 with the timer value set to the
*deprioritisationTimer* signalled;

2\> store the *deprioritisationReq* until T325 expiry;

NOTE 2: The UE stores the deprioritisation request irrespective of any
cell reselection absolute priority assignments (by dedicated or common
signalling) and regardless of RRC connections in NR or other RATs unless
specified otherwise.

1\> if the *RRCRelease* includes *suspendConfig*:

2\> apply the received *suspendConfig*;

2\> reset MAC and release the default MAC Cell Group configuration, if
any;

2\> re-establish RLC entities for SRB1;

2\> if the *RRCRelease* message with *suspendConfig* was received in
response to an *RRCResumeRequest* or an *RRCResumeRequest1*:

3\> stop the timer T319 if running;

3\> in the stored UE Inactive AS context:

4\> replace the K~gNB~ and K~RRCint~ keys with the current K~gNB~ and
K~RRCint~ keys;

4\> replace the C-RNTI with the temporary C-RNTI in the cell the UE has
received the *RRCRelease* message;

4\> replace the *cellIdentity* with the *cellIdentity* of the cell the
UE has received the *RRCRelease* message;

4\> replace the physical cell identity with the physical cell identity
of the cell the UE has received the *RRCRelease* message;

2\> else:

3\> store in the UE Inactive AS Context the current K~gNB~ and K~RRCint~
keys, the ROHC state, the stored QoS flow to DRB mapping rules, the
C-RNTI used in the source PCell, the *cellIdentity* and the physical
cell identity of the source PCell, and all other parameters configured
except for the ones within *ReconfigurationWithSync* and
*servingCellConfigCommonSIB*;

NOTE 3: *suspendConfig* is not stored as part of UE Inactive AS Context,
except for the fields explicitly specified.

2\> suspend all SRB(s) and DRB(s), except SRB0;

2\> indicate PDCP suspend to lower layers of all DRBs;

2\> if the *t380* is included:

3\> start timer T380, with the timer value set to *t380*;

2\> if the *RRCRelease* message is including the *waitTime*:

3\> start timer T302 with the value set to the *waitTime*;

3\> inform upper layers that access barring is applicable for all access
categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\';

2\> if T390 is running:

3\> stop timer T390 for all access categories;

3\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

2\> indicate the suspension of the RRC connection to upper layers;

2\> enter RRC\_INACTIVE and perform cell selection as specified in TS
38.304 \[20\];

1\> else

2\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with the release cause \'other\'.

#### 5.3.8.4 T320 expiry

The UE shall:

1\> if T320 expires:

2\> if stored, discard the cell reselection priority information
provided by the *cellReselectionPriorities* or inherited from another
RAT;

2\> apply the cell reselection priority information broadcast in the
system information.

#### 5.3.8.5 UE actions upon the expiry of *DataInactivityTimer*

Upon receiving the expiry of *DataInactivityTimer* from lower layers
while in RRC\_CONNECTED, the UE shall:

1\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'RRC connection failure\'.

### 5.3.9 RRC connection release requested by upper layers

#### 5.3.9.1 General

The purpose of this procedure is to release the RRC connection. Access
to the current PCell may be barred as a result of this procedure.

#### 5.3.9.2 Initiation

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers request the release of
the RRC connection as specified in TS 24.501 \[23\]. The UE shall not
initiate the procedure for power saving purposes.

The UE shall:

1\> if the upper layers indicate barring of the PCell:

2\> treat the PCell used prior to entering RRC\_IDLE as barred according
to TS 38.304 \[20\];

1\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'other\'.

### 5.3.10 Radio link failure related actions

#### 5.3.10.1 Detection of physical layer problems in RRC\_CONNECTED

The UE shall:

1\> upon receiving N310 consecutive \"out-of-sync\" indications for the
SpCell from lower layers while neither T300, T301, T304, T311 nor T319
are running:

2\> start timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell.

#### 5.3.10.2 Recovery of physical layer problems

Upon receiving N311 consecutive \"in-sync\" indications for the SpCell
from lower layers while T310 is running, the UE shall:

1\> stop timer T310 for the corresponding SpCell.

NOTE 1: In this case, the UE maintains the RRC connection without
explicit signalling, i.e. the UE maintains the entire radio resource
configuration.

NOTE 2: Periods in time where neither \"in-sync\" nor \"out-of-sync\" is
reported by L1 do not affect the evaluation of the number of consecutive
\"in-sync\" or \"out-of-sync\" indications.

#### 5.3.10.3 Detection of radio link failure

The UE shall:

1\> upon T310 expiry in PCell; or

1\> upon random access problem indication from MCG MAC while neither
T300, T301, T304, T311 nor T319 are running; or

1\> upon indication from MCG RLC that the maximum number of
retransmissions has been reached:

2\> if the indication is from MCG RLC and CA duplication is configured
and activated, and for the corresponding logical channel
*allowedServingCells* only includes SCell(s):

3\> initiate the failure information procedure as specified in 5.7.5 to
report RLC failure.

2\> else:

3\> consider radio link failure to be detected for the MCG, i.e. MCG
RLF;

3\> if AS security has not been activated:

4\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'other\';-

3\> else if AS security has been activated but SRB2 and at least one DRB
have not been setup:

4\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'RRC connection failure\';

3\> else:

4\> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in
5.3.7.

The UE shall:

1\> upon T310 expiry in PSCell; or

1\> upon random access problem indication from SCG MAC; or

1\> upon indication from SCG RLC that the maximum number of
retransmissions has been reached:

2\> if the indication is from SCG RLC and CA duplication is configured
and activated, and for the corresponding logical channel
*allowedServingCells* only includes SCell(s):

3\> initiate the failure information procedure as specified in 5.7.5 to
report RLC failure.

2\> else:

3\> consider radio link failure to be detected for the SCG, i.e. SCG
RLF;

3\> initiate the SCG failure information procedure as specified in 5.7.3
to report SCG radio link failure.

### 5.3.11 UE actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE

The UE shall:

1\> reset MAC;

1\> set the variable *pendingRNA-Update* to *false*, if that is set to
*true*;

message including a *waitTime*:

2\> if T302 is running:

3\> stop timer T302;

2\> start timer T302 with the value set to the *waitTime*;

2\> inform upper layers that access barring is applicable for all access
categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\'.

1\> else:

2\> if T302 is running:

3\> stop timer T302;

3\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> if T390 is running:

2\> stop timer T390 for all access categories;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> if the UE is leaving RRC\_INACTIVE:

2\> if going to RRC\_IDLE was not triggered by reception of the
*RRCRelease message*:

3\> if stored, discard the cell reselection priority information
provided by the *cellReselectionPriorities*;

3\> stop the timer T320, if running;

if any;

1\> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity,
the MAC configuration and the associated PDCP entity and SDAP for all
established RBs;

1\> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together
with the release cause;

1\> except if going to RRC\_IDLE was triggered by inter-RAT cell
reselection while the UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE or RRC\_IDLE or when
selecting an inter-RAT cell while T311 was running:

2\> enter RRC\_IDLE and perform cell selection as specified in TS 38.304
\[20\];

5.4 Inter-RAT mobility
----------------------

### 5.4.1 Introduction

Network controlled inter-RAT mobility between NR and E-UTRA is
supported, where E-UTRA can be connected to either EPC or 5GC.

### 5.4.2 Handover to NR

#### 5.4.2.1 General

Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to NR, successful

The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network,
transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network
(e.g. E-UTRAN) to NR.

The handover to NR procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination
with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from E-UTRA to NR
applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRA.

#### 5.4.2.2 Initiation

The RAN using another RAT initiates the handover to NR procedure, in
accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by
sending the *RRCReconfiguration* message via the radio access technology
from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.

The network applies the procedure as follows:

\- to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet
activated in the other RAT;

\- to re-establish SRBs and one or more DRBs;

#### 5.4.2.3 Reception of the *RRCReconfiguration* by the UE

The UE shall:

1\> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values
are provided in *SIB1*;

1\> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in
9.2.2;

1\> perform RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5;

NOTE: If the UE is connected to 5GC of the source E-UTRA cell, the delta
configuration for PDCP and SDAP can be used for intra-system inter-RAT
handover. For other cases, source RAT configuration is not considered
when the UE applies the reconfiguration message of target RAT.

### 5.4.3 Mobility from NR

#### 5.4.3.1 General

Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from NR, successful

Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from NR, failure

The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC\_CONNECTED to a
cell using other RAT, e.g. E-UTRA. The mobility from NR procedure covers
the following type of mobility:

\- handover, i.e. the *MobilityFromNRCommand* message includes radio
resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;

#### 5.4.3.2 Initiation

The network initiates the mobility from NR procedure to a UE in
RRC\_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a *MeasurementReport* message,
by sending a *MobilityFromNRCommand* message. The network applies the
procedure as follows:

\- the procedure is initiated only when AS security has been activated,
and SRB2 with at least one DRB have been setup and not suspended.

#### 5.4.3.3 Reception of the *MobilityFromNRCommand* by the UE

The UE shall:

1\> stop timer T310, if running;

1\> if T390 is running:

2\> stop timer T390 for all access categories;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> if the *targetRAT-Type* is set to *eutra*:

2\> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;

2\> forward the *nas-SecurityParamFromNR* to the upper layers, if
included;

1\> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in
accordance with the specifications of the target RAT.

#### 5.4.3.4 Successful completion of the mobility from NR

Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE
shall:

1\> reset MAC;

1\> stop all timers that are running except T325;

1\> release *ran-NotificationAreaInfo*, if stored;

1\> release the AS security context including the K~RRCenc~ key, the
K~RRCint~ key, the K~UPint~ key and the K~UPenc~ key, if stored;

1\> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and
the MAC configuration;

1\> release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all
established RBs;

NOTE : PDCP and SDAP configured by the source RAT prior to the handover
that are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling
(i.e., during inter-RAT intra-system handover when *fullConfig* is not
present) is used, are not released as part of this procedure.

1\> if the *targetRAT-Type* is set to *eutra* and the
*nas-SecurityParamFromNR* is included:

2\> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together
with the release cause \'other\'.

#### 5.4.3.5 Mobility from NR failure

The UE shall:

1\> if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the
target radio access technology; or

1\> if the UE is unable to comply with any part of the configuration
included in the *MobilityFromNRCommand* message; or

1\> if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included
in the *MobilityFromNRCommand* message, causing the UE to fail the
procedure according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:

2\> revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;

2\> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in
clause 5.3.7.

5.5 Measurements
----------------

### 5.5.1 Introduction

The network may configure an RRC\_CONNECTED UE to perform measurements
and report them in accordance with the measurement configuration. The
measurement configuration is provided by means of dedicated signalling
i.e. using the *RRCReconfiguration* or *RRCResume.*

The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of
measurements:

\- NR measurements;

\- Inter-RAT measurements of E-UTRA frequencies.

The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on SS/PBCH block(s):

\- Measurement results per SS/PBCH block;

\- Measurement results per cell based on SS/PBCH block(s);

\- SS/PBCH block(s) indexes.

The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on CSI-RS resources:

\- Measurement results per CSI-RS resource;

\- Measurement results per cell based on CSI-RS resource(s);

\- CSI-RS resource measurement identifiers.

The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:

**1. Measurement objects:** A list of objects on which the UE shall
perform the measurements.

\- For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement
object indicates the frequency/time location and subcarrier spacing of
reference signals to be measured. Associated with this measurement
object, the network may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a
list of \'blacklisted\' cells and a list of \'whitelisted\' cells.
Blacklisted cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement
reporting. Whitelisted cells are the only ones applicable in event
evaluation or measurement reporting.

\- The *measObjectId* of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell
is indicated by *servingCellMO* within the serving cell configuration.

\- For inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single
E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency,
the network can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of
\'blacklisted\' cells. Blacklisted cells are not applicable in event
evaluation or measurement reporting.

**2. Reporting configurations:** A list of reporting configurations
where there can be one or multiple reporting configurations per
measurement object. Each reporting configuration consists of the
following:

\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a
measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.

\- RS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement
results (SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).

\- Reporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE
includes in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated
information such as the maximum number of cells and the maximum number
beams per cell to report.

**3. Measurement identities:** A list of measurement identities where
each measurement identity links one measurement object with one
reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities,
it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same
reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting
configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity
is also included in the measurement report that triggered the reporting,
serving as a reference to the network.

**4. Quantity configurations:** The quantity configuration defines the
measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and
related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that measurement. For
NR measurements, the network may configure up to 2 quantity
configurations with a reference in the NR measurement object to the
configuration that is to be used. In each configuration, different
filter coefficients can be configured for different measurement
quantities, for different RS types, and for measurements per cell and
per beam.

**5. Measurement gaps:** Periods that the UE may use to perform
measurements.

A UE in RRC\_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting
configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to
signalling and procedures in this specification. The measurement object
list possibly includes NR measurement object(s) and inter-RAT objects.
Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes NR and inter-RAT
reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any
reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting
configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some
measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.

The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:

1\. The NR serving cell(s) -- these are the SpCell and one or more
SCells.

2\. Listed cells -- these are cells listed within the measurement
object(s).

3\. Detected cells -- these are cells that are not listed within the
measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB
frequency(ies) and subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement
object(s).

For NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving
cell(s), listed cells and/or detected cells. For inter-RAT measurements
object(s) of E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and
detected cells.

Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in clause
5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the
*VarMeasConfig* unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the
measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related
to the received *measConfig*.

In NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent *measConfig*:

\- a *measConfig*, associated with MCG, that is included in the
*RRCReconfiguration* message received via SRB1; and

\- a *measConfig*, associated with SCG, that is included in the
*RRCReconfiguration* message received via SRB3, or, alternatively,
included within a *RRCReconfiguration* message embedded in a
*RRCReconfiguration* message received via SRB1.

In this case, the UE maintains two independent *VarMeasConfig* and
*VarMeasReportList*, one associated with each *measConfig*, and
independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.5 for each
*measConfig* and the associated *VarMeasConfig* and *VarMeasReportList*,
unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### 5.5.2 Measurement configuration

#### 5.5.2.1 General

The network applies the procedure as follows:

\- to ensure that, whenever the UE has a *measConfig associated with a
CG*, it includes a *measObject* for the SpCell and for each NR SCell of
the CG to be measured;

\- to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a
reporting configuration with the *reportType* set to *reportCGI;*

*-* to ensure that, in the *measConfig* associated with a CG:

\- for all SSB based measurements there is at most one measurement
object with the same *ssbFrequency*;

*- an smtc1* included in any measurement object with the same
*ssbFrequency* has the same value and that an *smtc2* included in any
measurement object with the same *ssbFrequency* has the same value;

\- to ensure that all measurement objects configured in this
specification and in TS 36.331 \[10\] with the same *ssbFrequency* have
the same *ssbSubcarrierSpacing*;

\- to ensure that, if a measurement object associated with the MCG has
the same *ssbFrequency* as a measurement object associated with the SCG:

\- for that *ssbFrequency*, the measurement window according to the
*smtc1* configured by the MCG includes the measurement window according
to the *smtc1* configured by the SCG, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of
the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 \[14\].

\- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in
*measurementSlots* in both objects corresponding to the same slot are
set to the same value. Also, the *endSymbol* is the same in both
objects.

\- to ensure that, if a measurement object has the same *ssbFrequency*
as a measurement object configured in TS 36.331 \[10\]:

\- for that *ssbFrequency*, the measurement window according to the
*smtc* configured in TS 36.331 \[10\] includes the measurement window
according to the *smtc1* configured in TS 38.331, or vice-versa, with an
accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133
\[14\].

\- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in
*measurementSlots* in both objects corresponding to the same slot are
set to the same value. Also, the *endSymbol* is the same in both
objects.

\- when the UE is in NE-DC, NR-DC, or NR standalone, to configure at
most one measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting
configuration with the *reportType* set to *reportSFTD*;

For CSI-RS resources, the network applies the procedure as follows:

\- to ensure that all CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement
object have the same center frequency, (*startPRB*+floor(*nrofPRBs*/2))

The UE shall:

1\> if the received *measConfig* includes the *measObjectToRemoveList*:

2\> perform the measurement object removal procedure as specified in

of *s-MeasureConfig* within *VarMeasConfig* to the threshold value of
the RSRP indicated by the received value of *s-MeasureConfig* which is
derived as specified in 6.3.2*;*

2\> else, set parameter *csi-RSRP* of *s-MeasureConfig* within
*VarMeasConfig* to the threshold value of the RSRP indicated by the
received value of *s-MeasureConfig* which is derived as specified in
6.3.2.

### 5.5.3 Performing measurements

#### 5.5.3.1 General

An RRC\_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring
one or multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network,
as described in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results in
RRC\_CONNECTED the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in
5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting
criteria and measurement reporting. For cell measurements, the network
can configure RSRP, RSRQ or SINR as trigger quantity. Reporting
quantities can be any combination of quantities (i.e. only RSRP; only
RSRQ; only SINR; RSRP and RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ
and SINR), irrespective of the trigger quantity.

The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information
per beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with
respective beam identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as
described in 5.5.3.3a. If beam measurement information is configured to
be included in measurement reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam
filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2. On the other hand, the exact L1
filtering of beam measurements used to derive cell measurement results
is implementation dependent.

The UE shall:

1\> whenever the UE has a *measConfig*, perform RSRP and RSRQ
measurements for each serving cell for which *servingCellMO* is
configured as follows:

2\> if the *reportConfig* associated with at least one *measId* included
in the *measIdList* within *VarMeasConfig* contains an *rsType* set to
*ssb* and *ssb-ConfigMobility* is configured in the *measObject*
indicated by the *servingCellMO*, and *absoluteFrequencySSB* is
configured in *ServingCellConfigCommon*:

3\> if the *reportConfig* contains a *reportQuantityRS-Indexes* and
*maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport*:

4\> derive layer 3 filtered RSRP and RSRQ per beam for the serving cell
based on SS/PBCH block, as described in 5.5.3.3a;

3\> derive serving cell measurement results based on SS/PBCH block, as
described in 5.5.3.3;

2\> if the *reportConfig* associated with at least one *measId* included
in the *measIdList* within *VarMeasConfig* contains an *rsType* set to
*csi-rs* and *CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility* is configured in the
*measObject* indicated by the *servingCellMO*:

3\> if the *reportConfig* contains a *reportQuantityRS-Indexes* and
*maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport*:

4\> derive layer 3 filtered RSRP and RSRQ per beam for the serving cell
based on CSI-RS, as described in 5.5.3.3a;

3\> derive serving cell measurement results based on CSI-RS, as
described in 5.5.3.3;

1\> for each serving cell for which *servingCellMO* is configured, if
the *reportConfig* associated with at least one *measId* included in the

#### 5.5.3.2 Layer 3 filtering

The UE shall:

1\> for each cell measurement quantity and for each beam measurement
quantity that the UE performs measurements according to 5.5.3.1:

2\> filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting
criteria or for measurement reporting, by the following formula:

***F*~n~ = (1 -- *a*)\**F*~n-1~ + *a*\**M*~n~**

where

***M~n~*** is the latest received measurement result from the physical
layer;

***F~n~*** is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for
evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting;

***F~n-1~*** is the old filtered measurement result, where ***F~0~*** is
set to ***M~1~*** when the first measurement result from the physical
layer is received; and for NR, ***a*** = 1/2^(***ki***/4)^, where
***k~i~*** is the *filterCoefficient* for the corresponding measurement
quantity of the i:th *QuantityConfigNR* in *quantityConfigNR-List*, and
*i* is indicated by *quantityConfigIndex* in *MeasObjectNR;* for E-UTRA,
***a*** = 1/2^(***k***/4)^, where ***k*** is the *filterCoefficient* for
the corresponding measurement quantity received by *quantityConfigEUTRA*
in the *quantityConfig;*

2\> adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter
are preserved at different input rates, observing that the
*filterCoefficient k* assumes a sample rate equal to X ms; The value of
X is equivalent to one intra-frequency L1 measurement period as defined
in TS 38.133 \[14\] assuming non-DRX operation, and depends on frequency
range.

NOTE 1: If ***k*** is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.

NOTE 2: The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for
evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e.,
logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements.

NOTE 3: The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the
performance requirements set in TS 38.133 \[14\]. For further details
about the physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 \[14\].

#### 5.5.3.3 Derivation of cell measurement results

The network may configure the UE to derive RSRP, RSRQ and SINR

beams to be averaged and beam consolidation thresholds) and in the
*reportConfig* (*rsType* to be measured, SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).

highest beam measurement quantity value, where each beam measurement
quantity is described in TS 38.215 \[9\];

2\> else:

linear power scale average of the highest beam measurement quantity
values above *absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation* where the total number of
averaged beams shall not exceed *nrofSS-BlocksToAverage*;

2\> apply layer 3 cell filtering as described in 5.5.3.2;

1\> for each cell measurement quantity to be derived based on CSI-RS:

2\> consider a CSI-RS resource to be applicable for deriving cell
measurements when the concerned CSI-RS resource is included in the
*csi-rs-CellMobility* including the *physCellId* of the cell in
the*CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility* in the associated *measObject*;

2\> if *nrofCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage* in the associated *measObject* is
not configured; or

resources for the cell as the highest beam measurement quantity value,

based on SS/PBCH block;

### 5.5.6 Location measurement indication

#### 5.5.6.1 General

Figure 5.5.6.1-1: Location measurement indication

The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE
is going to start/stop location related measurements (*eutra-RSTD*)
which require measurement gaps or start/stop subframe and slot timing
detection towards E-UTRA (*eutra-FineTimingDetection)* which requires
measurement gaps. UE shall initiate this procedure only after successful
AS security activation.

NOTE: It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.

#### 5.5.6.2 Initiation

The UE shall:

1\> if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing location
measurements or start subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA,
and the UE requires measurement gaps for these operations while
measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:

2\> initiate the procedure to indicate start;

NOTE 1: The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon
receiving the indication from upper layers. If at this point in time
sufficient gaps are available, the UE does not initiate the procedure.
Unless it receives a new indication from upper layers, the UE is only
allowed to further repeat the procedure in the same PCell once per
frequency of the target RAT if the provided measurement gaps are
insufficient.

1\> if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing location
measurements or stop subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:

2\> initiate the procedure to indicate stop.

NOTE 2: The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it
did not previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.

#### 5.5.6.3 Actions related to transmission of *LocationMeasurementIndication* message

The UE shall set the contents of *LocationMeasurementIndication* message
as follows:

1\> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of location related
measurements:

2\> if the procedure is initiated for RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA:

3\> set the *measurementIndication* to the *eutra-RSTD* according to the
information received from upper layers;

1\> else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of location
related measurements:

2\> set the *measurementIndication* to the value *release*;

1\> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of subframe and slot
timing detection towards E-UTRA:

2\> set the *measurementIndication* to the value
*eutra-FineTimingDetection*;

1\> else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of subframe and
slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:

2\> set the *measurementIndication* to the value *release*;

1\> submit the *LocationMeasurementIndication* message to lower layers
for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.

5.6 UE capabilities
-------------------

### 5.6.1 UE capability transfer

#### 5.6.1.1 General

This clause describes how the UE compiles and transfers its UE
capability information upon receiving a UECapabilityEnquiry from the
network.

Figure 5.6.1.1-1: UE capability transfer

#### 5.6.1.2 Initiation

The network initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC\_CONNECTED when it
needs (additional) UE radio access capability information. The network
should retrieve UE capabilities only after AS security activation.
Network does not forward UE capabilities that were retrieved before AS
security activation to the CN.

#### 5.6.1.3 Reception of the *UECapabilityEnquiry* by the UE

The UE shall set the contents of *UECapabilityInformation* message as
follows:

1\> if the *ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList* contains a
*UE-CapabilityRAT-Request* with *rat-Type* set to *nr*:

2\> include in the *ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList* a
*UE-CapabilityRAT-Container* of the type *UE-NR-Capability* and with the

5.6.3.3, according to the *capabilityRequestFilter*, if received;

1\> submit the *UECapabilityInformation* message to lower layers for

#### 5.6.1.4 Setting band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets supported by the UE

The UE invokes the procedures in this clause if the NR or E-UTRA network
requests UE capabilities for *nr*, *eutra-nr* or *eutra*. This procedure
is invoked once per requested *rat-Type* (see clause 5.6.1.3 for
capability enquiry by the NR network; see TS 36.331 \[10\], clause
5.6.3.3 for capability enquiry by the E-UTRA network). The UE shall
ensure that the feature set IDs are consistent across feature sets,
feature set combinations and band combinations in all three UE
capability containers that the network queries with the same fields with
the same values, i.e. *UE-CapabilityRequestFilterNR,*
*UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon* and fields in *UECapabilityEnquiry*
message (i.e. *requestedFreqBandsNR-MRDC, requestedCapabilityNR,
eutra-nr-only* flag, and *requestedCapabilityCommon*) as defined in TS
36.331 \[10\], where applicable.

NOTE 1: Capability enquiry without *frequencyBandListFilter* is not
supported.

NOTE 2: In (NG)EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types *nr*
and *eutra-nr* and it uses the *featureSets* in the *UE-NR-Capability*
together with the *featureSetCombinations* in the *UE-MRDC-Capability*
to determine the NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band
combinations. Similarly, the eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types
*eutra* and *eutra-nr* and it uses the *featureSetsEUTRA* in the
*UE-EUTRA-Capability* together with the *featureSetCombinations* in the
*UE-MRDC-Capability* to determine the E-UTRA UE capabilities for the
supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used in the
*featureSets* must match the IDs referred to in *featureSetCombinations*
across all three containers. The requirement on consistency implies that
there are no undefined feature sets and feature set combinations.

NOTE 3: If the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set
combinations due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to
UE implementation which feature sets and feature set combinations it
prioritizes.

The UE shall:

1\> compile a list of \"candidate band combinations\" according to the
filter criteria in *capabilityRequestFilterCommon* (if included), only
consisting of bands included in *frequencyBandListFilter*, and
prioritized in the order of *frequencyBandListFilter* (i.e. first
include band combinations containing the first-listed band, then include
remaining band combinations containing the second-listed band, and so
on), where for each band in the band combination, the parameters of the
band do not exceed *maxBandwidthRequestedDL*, *maxBandwidthRequestedUL*,
*maxCarriersRequestedDL*, *maxCarriersRequestedUL*,
*ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA* or *ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA*, whichever
are received;

1\> for each band combination included in the list of \"candidate band
combinations\":

2\> if the network (E-UTRA) included the *eutra-nr-only* field, or

2\> if the requested *rat-Type* is *eutra*:

3\> remove the NR-only band combination from the list of \"candidate
band combinations\";

NOTE 4: The (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for *nr* but
indicate with the *eutra-nr-only* flag that the UE shall not include any
NR band combinations in the *UE-NR-Capability*. In this case the
procedural text above removes all NR-only band combinations from the
candidate list and thereby also avoids inclusion of corresponding
feature set combinations and feature sets below.

2\> if it is regarded as a fallback band combination with the same
capabilities of another band combination included in the list of
\"candidate band combinations\", and

2\> if this fallback band combination is generated by releasing at least
one SCell or uplink configuration of SCell or SUL according to TS 38.306
\[26\]:

3\> remove the band combination from the list of \"candidate band
combinations\";

NOTE 5: Even if the network requests (only) capabilities for *nr*, it
may include E-UTRA band numbers in the *frequencyBandListFilter* to
ensure that the UE includes all necessary feature sets needed for
subsequently requested *eutra-nr* capabilities. At this point of the
procedure the list of \"candidate band combinations\" contains all NR-
and/or E-UTRA-NR band combinations that match the filter
(*frequencyBandListFilter*) provided by the NW and that match the
*eutra-nr-only* flag (if RAT-Type *nr* is requested by E-UTRA). In the
following, this candidate list is used to derive the band combinations,
feature set combinations and feature sets to be reported in the
requested capability container.

1\> if the requested *rat-Type* is *nr*:

2\> include into *supportedBandCombinationList* as many NR-only band
combinations as possible from the list of \"candidate band
combinations\", starting from the first entry;

3\> if *srs-SwitchingTimeRequest* is received:

4\> if SRS carrier switching is supported;

5\> include *srs-SwitchingTimesListNR* for each band combination;

4\> set *srs-SwitchingTimeRequested* to *true*;

2\> include, into *featureSetCombinations*, the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
*supportedBandCombinationList* according to the previous;

2\> compile a list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" referenced
from the list of \"candidate band combinations\" excluding entries (rows
in feature set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;

NOTE 6: This list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" contains the
feature set combinations used for NR-only as well as E-UTRA-NR band
combinations. It is used to derive a list of NR feature sets referred to
from the feature set combinations in the *UE-NR-Capability* and from the
feature set combinations in a *UE-MRDC-Capability* container.

2\> include into *featureSets* the feature sets referenced from the
\"candidate feature set combinations\" and may exclude the feature sets
with the parameters that exceed any of *maxBandwidthRequestedDL*,
*maxBandwidthRequestedUL*, *maxCarriersRequestedDL* or
*maxCarriersRequestedUL*, whichever are received;

1\> else, if the requested *rat-Type* is *eutra-nr*:

2\> include into *supportedBandCombinationList* and/or
*supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only* as many E-UTRA-NR band
combinations as possible from the list of \"candidate band
combinations\", starting from the first entry;

3\> if *srs-SwitchingTimeRequest* is received:

4\> if SRS carrier switching is supported;

5\> include *srs-SwitchingTimesListNR* and *srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA*
for each band combination;

4\> set *srs-SwitchingTimeRequested* to *true*;

2\> include, into *featureSetCombinations*, the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
*supportedBandCombinationList* according to the previous;

1\> else (if the requested *rat-Type* is *eutra*):

2\> compile a list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" referenced
from the list of \"candidate band combinations\" excluding entries (rows
in feature set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;

NOTE 7: This list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" contains the
feature set combinations used for E-UTRA-NR band combinations. It is
used to derive a list of E-UTRA feature sets referred to from the
feature set combinations in a *UE-MRDC-Capability* container.

2\> include into *featureSetsEUTRA* (in the *UE-EUTRA-Capability)* the
feature sets referenced from the \"candidate feature set combinations\"
and may exclude the feature sets with the parameters that exceed
*ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA* or *ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA*, whichever
are received;

1\> include the received *frequencyBandListFilter* in the field
*appliedFreqBandListFilter* of the requested UE capability, except if
the requested *rat-Type* is *nr* and the network included the
*eutra-nr-only* field;

1\> if the network included *ue-CapabilityEnquiryExt*:

2\> include the received *ue-CapabilityEnquiryExt* in the field
*receivedFilters*;

about a failure detected by the UE. In particular, the UE initiates the
procedure when the following condition is met:

1\> upon detecting failure for an RLC bearer, in accordance with
5.3.10.3;

Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> initiate transmission of the *FailureInformation* message as
specified in 5.7.5.3;

#### 5.7.5.3 Actions related to transmission of *FailureInformation* message

The UE shall:

1\> if initiated to provide RLC failure information, set
*FailureInfoRLC-Bearer* as follows:

2\> set *logicalChannelIdentity* to the logical channel identity of the
failing RLC bearer;

2\> set *cellGroupId* to the cell group identity of the failing RLC
bearer;

2\> set the *failureType* as *rlc-failure*;

1\> if used to inform the network about a failure for an MCG RLC bearer:

2\> submit the *FailureInformation* message to lower layers for
transmission via SRB1;

1\> else if used to inform the network about a failure for an SCG RLC
bearer:

2\> if SRB3 is configured;

3\> submit the *FailureInformation* message to lower layers for
transmission via SRB3;

2\> else;

3\> if the UE is in (NG)EN-DC:

4\> submit the *FailureInformation* message via E-UTRA embedded in
E-UTRA RRC message *ULInformationTransferMRDC* as specified in TS 36.331
\[10\].

3\> else if the UE is in NR-DC:

4\> submit the *FailureInformation* message via SRB1 embedded in NR RRC
message *ULInformationTransferMRDC* as specified in clause 5.7.2a.3.

6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters (ASN.1)
=====================================================

6.1 General
-----------

### 6.1.1 Introduction

The contents of each RRC message is specified in clause 6.2 using ASN.1
to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide
further detailed information about the fields specified in the message
syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as
stand-alone abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in
clause 6.3.

Usage of the text \"Network always configures the UE with a value for
this field\" in the field description indicates that the network has to
provide a value for the field in this or in a previous message based on
delta configuration (for an optional field with Need M). It does not
imply a mandatory presence of the field.

### 6.1.2 Need codes and conditions for optional downlink fields

The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type,
i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract
notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to
the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are
available for use in the downlink direction only. The meaning of each
tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1.

If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the
message or information element specifying the need of the field for each
condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or
releases the value in case the field is absent. The conditions clarify
what the UE may expect regarding the setting of the message by the
network. Violation of conditions is regarded as invalid network
behaviour, which the UE is not required to cope with. Hence the general
error handling defined in 10.4 does not apply in case a field is absent
although it is mandatory according to the CondC or CondM condition.

For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6
and A.7.

|                    | receiving a message with the field absent, the |
|                    | UE releases the current value.                 |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: In this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and
CondM are not used.

Any field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be
interpreted as Need R.

The need code used within a CondX definition only applies for the case
(part of the condition) where it is defined: A condition may have
different need codes for different parts of the condition. In
particular, the CondX definition may contain the following \"otherwise
the field is absent\" parts:

\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent\": The field is not relevant or
should not be configured when this part of the condition applies. In
particular, the UE behaviour is not defined when the field is configured
via another part of the condition and is reconfigured to this part of
the condition. A need code is not provided when the transition from
another part of the condition to this part of the condition is not
supported, when the field clearly is a one-shot or there is no
difference whether UE maintains or releases the value (e.g., in case the
field is mandatory present according to the other part of the
condition).

\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need R\": The field is released if
absent when this part of the condition applies. This handles UE
behaviour in case the field is configured via another part of the
condition and this part of the condition applies (which means that
network can assume UE releases the field if this part of the condition
is valid).

\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need M\": The UE retains the field
if it was already configured when this part of the condition applies.
This means the network cannot release the field , but UE retains the
previously configured value.

Use of different Need codes in different parts of a condition should be
avoided.

For downlink messages, the need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults
specified for a particular (child) field only apply in case the (parent)
field including the particular field is present. Thus, if the parent is
absent the UE shall not release the field unless the absence of the
parent field implies that.

For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink messages, if the
parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes of the child
fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each child
field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child
fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend
on the specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields
in downlink messages without need codes where this rule applies are:

\- *nonCriticalExtension* fields at the end of a message using empty
SEQUENCE extension mechanism,

\- groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to
as extension groups), and

\- non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a
structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as
parent extension fields).

The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated
by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field1 InformationElement1 OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

field2 InformationElement2 OPTIONAL, \-- Need R

nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1570-IEs OPTIONAL

}

RRCMessage-1570-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1640-IEs OPTIONAL

}

RRCMessage-v1640-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field4 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, \-- Need R

nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL

}

InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE {

field10 InformationElement10 OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

field11 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

field12 InformationElement12 OPTIONAL, \-- Need R

\...,

\[\[

field13 InformationElement13 OPTIONAL, \-- Need R

field14 InformationElement14 OPTIONAL \-- Need M

\]\]

}

InformationElement2 ::= SEQUENCE {

field21 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

\...

}

\-- ASN1STOP

The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:

\- if *field1* in *RRCMessage-IEs* is absent, UE does not modify or take
action on any child fields configured within *field1* (regardless of
their need codes);

\- if *field2* in *RRCMessage-IEs* is absent, UE releases the *field2*
(and also its child field *field21*);

\- if *field1* or *field2* in *RRCMessage-IEs* is present, UE retains or
releases their child fields according to the child field presence
conditions;

\- if *field1* in *RRCMessage-IEs* is present but the extension group
containing *field13* and *field14* is absent, the UE releases *field13*
but does not modify *field14*;

\- if *nonCriticalExtension* defined by IE *RRCMessage-v1570-IEs* is
absent, the UE does not modify *field3* but releases *field4*;

### 6.1.3 General rules

In the ASN.1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers
to the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.

Upon reception of a list not using ToAddModList and ToReleaseList
structure, the UE shall delete all entries of the list currently in the
UE configuration before applying the received list and shall consider
each entry as newly created. This applies also to lists whose size is
extended (i.e. with a second list structure in the ASN.1 comprising
additional entries). This implies that Need M should not be used for
fields in the entries of these lists; if used, UE will handle such
fields equivalent to a Need R.

The IE *BWP* is used to configure generic parameters of a bandwidth part
as defined in TS 38.211 \[16\], clause 4.5, and TS 38.213 \[13\], clause
12.

For each serving cell the network configures at least an initial
downlink bandwidth part and one (if the serving cell is configured with
an uplink) or two (if using supplementary uplink (SUL)) initial uplink
bandwidth parts. Furthermore, the network may configure additional
uplink and downlink bandwidth parts for a serving cell.

The uplink and downlink bandwidth part configurations are divided into
common and dedicated parameters.

  Conditional Presence   Explanation
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *SpCellOnly*           The field is optionally present, Need M, in the *BWP-UplinkDedicated* of an SpCell. It is absent otherwise.

NOTE 1: In case of *RRCReconfiguration* with *reconfigurationWithSync*,
the UE performs a MAC reset, which involves releasing the
PUCCH-CSI/SRS/SR configuration in accordance with clause 5.3.12 and TS
38.321 \[3\], clauses 5.12 and 5.2. Hence, for these parts of the
dedicated radio resource configuration, delta signalling is not
supported in the message when *reconfigurationWithSync* is included.

| The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for |

| *spCellConfigCommon*. For case of NR PCell change and NR PSCell      |

| of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the   |
| timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change   |
| (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is |

NOTE: In case of change of AS security key derived from
S-K~gNB~/S-K~eNB~, if *reconfigurationWithSync* is not included in the
*masterCellGroup*, the network releases all existing MCG RLC bearers
associated with a radio bearer with *keyToUse* set to *secondary*. In
case of change of AS security key derived from K~gNB~/K~eNB~, if
*reconfigurationWithSync* is not included in the *secondaryCellGroup*,
the network releases all existing SCG RLC bearers associated with a
radio bearer with *keyToUse* set to *master*.

#### -- *CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList*

The *CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList* IE is used to configure the UE with
a list of aperiodic trigger states. Each codepoint of the DCI field
\"CSI request\" is associated with one trigger state (see TS 38.321
\[3\], clause 6.1.3.13). Upon reception of the value associated with a
trigger state, the UE will perform measurement of CSI-RS, CSI-IM and/or
SSB (reference signals) and aperiodic reporting on L1 according to all
entries in the *associatedReportConfigInfoList* for that trigger state.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *InitialBWP-Only*      If *SIB1* is broadcast the field is mandatory present in the *PDCCH-ConfigCommon* of the initial BWP (BWP\#0) in *ServingCellConfigCommon*; it is absent in other BWPs and when sent in system information. If SIB1 is not broadcast and there is an SSB associated to the cell, the field is optionally present, Need M, in the *PDCCH-ConfigCommon* of the initial BWP (BWP\#0) in *ServingCellConfigCommon* (still with the same setting for all UEs). In other cases, the field is absent.
  *OtherBWP*             This field is optionally present, Need R, if this BWP is not the initial DL BWP and *pagingSearchSpace* is configured in this BWP. Otherwise this field is absent.

#### -- *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList*

The IE *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation* is used to configure a time
domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. The
*PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList* contains one or more of such
*PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocations*. The network indicates in the DL
assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall
apply for that DL assignment. The UE determines the bit width of the DCI
field based on the number of entries in the
*PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList*. Value 0 in the DCI field
refers to the first element in this list, value 1 in the DCI field
refers to the second element in this list, and so on.

| monitoring based on the activated *TCI-State* for PDCCH as described |

#### -- *ReportConfigNR*

The IE *ReportConfigNR* specifies criteria for triggering of an NR
measurement reporting event. Measurement reporting events are based on
cell measurement results, which can either be derived based on SS/PBCH
block or CSI-RS. These events are labelled AN with N equal to 1, 2 and
so on.

Event A1: Serving becomes better than absolute threshold;

Event A2: Serving becomes worse than absolute threshold;

Event A3: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;

Event A4: Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;

Event A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND
Neighbour/SCell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;

Event A6: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than SCell.

#### -- *SearchSpaceId*

The IE *SearchSpaceId* is used to identify Search Spaces. The ID space
is used across the BWPs of a Serving Cell. The search space with the
*SearchSpaceId* = 0 identifies the search space configured via PBCH
(MIB) and in *ServingCellConfigCommon* (*searchSpaceZero*). The number
of Search Spaces per BWP is limited to 10 including the common and UE
specific Search Spaces.

NOTE 1: If the dedicated part of initial UL/DL BWP configuration is
absent, the initial BWP can be used but with some limitations. For
example, changing to another BWP requires *RRCReconfiguration* since DCI
format 1\_0 doesn\'t support DCI-based switching.

#### -- *ServingCellConfigCommon*

The IE *ServingCellConfigCommon* is used to configure cell specific
parameters of a UE\'s serving cell. The IE contains parameters which a
UE would typically acquire from SSB, MIB or SIBs when accessing the cell
from IDLE. With this IE, the network provides this information in
dedicated signalling when configuring a UE with a SCells or with an
additional cell group (SCG). It also provides it for SpCells (MCG and
SCG) upon reconfiguration with sync.

#### -- *SRS-Config*

The IE *SRS-Config* is used to configure sounding reference signal
transmissions. The configuration defines a list of SRS-Resources and a
list of SRS-ResourceSets. Each resource set defines a set of
SRS-Resources. The network triggers the transmission of the set of
SRS-Resources using a configured aperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger (L1 DCI).

#### -- *FeatureSetCombination*

The IE *FeatureSetCombination* is a two-dimensional matrix of
*FeatureSet* entries.

Each *FeatureSetsPerBand* contains a list of feature sets applicable to
the carrier(s) of one band entry of the associated band combination.
Across the associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of
*FeatureSets* at the same position in the *FeatureSetsPerBand*. All
*FeatureSetsPerBand* in one *FeatureSetCombination* must have the same
number of entries.

The number of *FeatureSetsPerBand* in the *FeatureSetCombination* must
be equal to the number of band entries in an associated band
combination. The first *FeatureSetPerBand* applies to the first band
entry of the band combination, and so on.

Each *FeatureSet* contains either a pair of NR or E-UTRA feature set IDs
for UL and DL.

In case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the
*FeatureSets* IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their
position in the *featureSetsUplink* / *featureSetsDownlink* list in the
FeatureSet IE.

In case of E-UTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are
defined in TS 36.331 \[10\] and conveyed as part of the
*UE-EUTRA-Capability* container.

The *FeatureSetUplink* and *FeatureSetDownlink* referred to from the
*FeatureSet* comprise, among other information, a set of
*FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Ids* and *FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Ids*. The
number of these per-CC IDs determines the number of carriers that the UE
is able to aggregate contiguously in frequency domain in the
corresponding band. The number of carriers supported by the UE is also
restricted by the bandwidth class indicated in the associated
*BandCombination*, if present.

In feature set combinations the UE shall exclude entries with same or
lower capabilities, since the network may anyway assume that the UE
supports those.

NOTE 1: The UE may advertise fallback band-combinations in which it
supports additional functionality explicitly in two ways: Either by
setting FeatureSet IDs to zero (inter-band and intra-band non-contiguous
fallback) and by reducing the number of FeatureSet-PerCC Ids in a
Feature Set (intra-band contiguous fallback). Or by separate
*BandCombination* entries with associated *FeatureSetCombinations*.

NOTE 2: The UE may advertise a *FeatureSetCombination* containing only
fallback band combinations. That means, in a *FeatureSetCombination,*
each group of *FeatureSets* across the bands may contain at least one
pair of *FeatureSetUplinkId* and *FeatureSetDownlinkId* which is set to
0/0.

NOTE 3: The Network configures serving cell(s) and BWP(s) configuration
to comply with capabilities derived from the combination of FeatureSets
at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand, regardless of
activated/deactivated serving cell(s) and BWP(s).

*FeatureSetDownlinkId* of a *FeatureSetDownlink* is the index position
of the *FeatureSetDownlink* in the *featureSetsDownlink* list in the
*FeatureSets* IE. The first element in that list is referred to by
*FeatureSetDownlinkId* = 1. The *FeatureSetDownlinkId=0* is not used by
an actual *FeatureSetDownlink* but means that the UE does not support a
carrier in this band of a band combination.

#### -- *FeatureSets*

The IE *FeatureSets* is used to provide pools of downlink and uplink
features sets. A *FeatureSetCombination* refers to the IDs of the
feature set(s) that the UE supports in that *FeatureSetCombination*. The
*BandCombination* entries in the *BandCombinationList* then indicate the
ID of the *FeatureSetCombination* that the UE supports for that band
combination.

The entries in the lists in this IE are identified by their index
position. For example, the *FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id* = 4 identifies the
4^th^ element in the *featureSetsUplinkPerCC* list.

NOTE: When feature sets (per CC) IEs require extension in future
versions of the specification, new versions of the *FeatureSetDownlink*,
*FeatureSetUplink*, *FeatureSets*, *FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC* and/or
*FeatureSetUplinkPerCC* will be created and instantiated in
corresponding new lists in the *FeatureSets* IE. For example, if new
capability bits are to be added to the *FeatureSetDownlink*, they will
instead be defined in a new *FeatureSetDownlink-rxy* which will be
instantiated in a new *featureSetDownlinkList-rxy* list. If a UE
indicates in a *FeatureSetCombination* that it supports the
*FeatureSetDownlink* with ID \#5, it implies that it supports both the
features in *FeatureSetDownlink* \#5 and *FeatureSetDownlink-rxy* \#5
(if present). The number of entries in the new list(s) shall be the same
as in the original list(s).

7.4 UE variables
----------------

NOTE: To facilitate the specification of the UE behavioural
requirements, UE variables are represented using ASN.1. Unless
explicitly specified otherwise, it is however up to UE implementation
how to store the variables. The optionality of the IEs in ASN.1 is used
only to indicate that the values may not always be available.

8 Protocol data unit abstract syntax
====================================

8.1 General
-----------

The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using
abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680
\[6\] and X.681 \[7\]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from
their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as
specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 \[8\].

The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been
specified in X.691:

\- When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6
to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be
placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the
bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;

NOTE: The terms \'leading bit\' and \'trailing bit\' are defined in
ITU-T Rec. X.680. When using the \'bstring\' notation, the leading bit
of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit
string value is on the right.

\- When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint
(\"CONTAINING\"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be
performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should
not cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is
recommended that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that
contains the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint,
and then decodes the contained type that is nested within the OCTET
STRING or BIT STRING as a separate step;

\- When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a
Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents
Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there
are extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC
message PDU, BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.

8.2 Structure of encoded RRC messages
-------------------------------------

An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer
entities/across the radio interface contains the basic production as
defined in X.691.

RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC
SDUs (in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as
follows:

\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the
first bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and

\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the
first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and

\- upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of
the PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards;
and

\- upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the
RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.

8.3 Basic production
--------------------

The \'basic production\' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the
abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It
always contains a multiple of 8 bits.

8.4 Extension
-------------

The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol
extensions:

\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall,
unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the
extension part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may
send non-empty extensions;

\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall
set spare bits to zero.

8.5 Padding
-----------

If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC
layer shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.

Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a
multiple of 8.

Figure 8.5-1: RRC level padding

9 Specified and default radio configurations
============================================

Specified and default configurations are configurations of which the
details are specified in the standard. Specified configurations are
fixed while default configurations can be modified using dedicated
signalling. The default value for the parameters not listed in following
clauses shall be set such as the corresponding features are not
configured, i.e. *release* or *false* unless explicitly stated
otherwise.

NOTE: The UE applies the default values specified in the field
description of ASN.1 parameters only when the parent IE is present.
Hence, the UE does not apply all default values in field descriptions
when it applies the \"default radio configuration\" in accordance with
this clause.

### 9.1.2 Void

9.2 Default radio configurations
--------------------------------

The following clauses only list default values for REL-15 parameters
included in protocol version v15.3.0. For all fields introduced in a
later protocol version, the default value is \"released\" or \"false\"
unless explicitly specified otherwise. If the UE is to apply default
configuration while it is configured with some critically extended
fields, the UE shall apply the original version of those fields with
only default values.

NOTE 1: In general, the signalling should preferably support a
\"release\" option for fields introduced after v15.3.0. The \"value not
applicable\" should be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields
which value is relevant only if another field is set to a value other
than its default.

NOTE 2: For parameters in *ServingCellConfig*, the default values are
specified in the corresponding specification.

10 Generic error handling
=========================

10.1 General
------------

The generic error handling defined in the subsequent clauses applies
unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific
error handling.

The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:

\- to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the
transfer syntax supported by the UE;

\- to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines
specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned
spare/reserved value.

The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:

\- as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific
behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned
spare/reserved field.

10.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error
--------------------------------------

The UE shall:

1\> when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, CCCH or PCCH for which
the abstract syntax is invalid \[6\]:

2\> ignore the message.

NOTE: This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value,
other than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this
version of the transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value
12 for a field defined as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may
not be possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the
error handling is at the message level.

10.3 Field set to a not comprehended value
------------------------------------------

The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:

1\> if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does
not comprehend:

2\> if a default value is defined for this field:

3\> treat the message while using the default value defined for this
field;

2\> else if the concerned field is optional:

3\> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with
the need code for absence of the concerned field;

2\> else:

3\> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with
clause 10.4.

10.4 Mandatory field missing
----------------------------

The UE shall:

1\> if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the
message (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled)
and that field is absent or treated as absent:

2\> if the RRC message was not received on DCCH or CCCH:

3\> if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a
SEQUENCE OF):

4\> treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not
comprehended field was absent;

3\> else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to
as the \'parent\' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up
compared to the erroneous field:

4\> consider the \'parent\' field to be set to a not comprehended value;

4\> apply the generic error handling to the subsequent \'parent\'
field(s), until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;

3\> else (field at message level):

4\> ignore the message.

NOTE 1: The error handling defined in these clauses implies that the UE
ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not
comprehended value.

NOTE 2: The nested error handling for messages received on logical
channels other than DCCH and CCCH applies for errors in extensions also,
even for errors that can be regarded as invalid network operation e.g.
the network not observing conditional presence.

NOTE 3: UE behaviour on receipt of an RRC message on DCCH or CCCH that
does not include a field that is mandatory (e.g. because conditions for
mandatory presence are fulfilled) is unspecified.

The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of
nested error handling for errors in extension fields.

The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels
applicable in case of nested error handling:

\- an extension additon group is not regarded as a level on its own.
E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the
conditionality of *field3* would result in the entire itemInfo entry to
be ignored (rather than just the extension addition group containing
*field3* and *field4*);

\- a traditional *nonCriticalExtension* is not regarded as a level on
its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, an error regarding
the conditionality of *field3* would result in the entire
*BroadcastInfoBlock1* to be ignored (rather than just the non-critical
extension containing *field3* and *field4*).

10.5 Not comprehended field
---------------------------

The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:

1\> if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:

2\> treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.

NOTE: This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the
value range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the
requirements in clause 10.3.

11 Radio information related interactions between network nodes
===============================================================

11.1 General
------------

This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network
nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via
another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have
similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across
the NR radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol
extension mechanisms apply.

11.2 Inter-node RRC messages
----------------------------

### 11.2.1 General

This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-,
Xn- or the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single
\'logical channel\' is used for all RRC messages transferred across
network nodes. The information could originate from or be destined for
another RAT.

### 11.2.3 Mandatory information in inter-node RRC messages

For the *AS-Config* transferred within the
*HandoverPreparationInformation*:

\- The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the
current AS configuration of the UE, except for the fields
*sourceSCG-NR-Config*, *sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config* and
*sourceRB-SN-Config*, which can be omitted in case the source MN did not
receive the latest configuration from the source SN. For
*RRCReconfiguration* included in the field *rrcReconfiguration*,
*ReconfigurationWithSync* is included with only the mandatory subfields
(e.g. *newUE-Identity* and *t304*) and *ServingCellConfigCommon*;

\- Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs
defined in clause 6 do not apply. I.e. some fields shall be included
regardless of the \"Need\" or \"Cond\" e.g. *discardTimer*;

\- Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate
the delta (difference) to the current AS configuration (as included in
*HandoverCommand*) to the UE. The fields *newUE-Identity* and *t304*
included in *ReconfigurationWithSync* are not used for delta
configuration purpose.

The *candidateCellInfoListSN*(-*EUTRA*) in *CG-Config* and the
*candidateCellInfoListMN*(*-EUTRA*)/*candidateCellInfoListSN*(-*EUTRA*)
in *CG-ConfigInfo* need not be included in procedures that do not
involve a change of node.

For fields *scg-CellGroupConfig, scg-CellGroupConfigEUTRA and
scg-RB-Config* in *CG-Config (sent upon SN initiated SN change or* other
conditions as specified in field descriptions*)* and fields
*mcg-RB-Config*, *scg-RB-Config* and *sourceConfigSCG* in
*CG-ConfigInfo* (*sent* upon change of SN):

\- The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the
current AS configuration of the UE, unless stated otherwise in the field
description. For *RRCReconfiguration* included in the field
*scg-CellGroupConfig in CG-Config*, *ReconfigurationWithSync* is
included with only the mandatory subfields (e.g. *newUE-Identity* and
*t304*) and *ServingCellConfigCommon*;

\- Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs
defined in clause 6 do not apply;

\- Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate
the delta (difference) as compared to the current AS configuration to
the UE. The fields *newUE-Identity* and *t304* in
*ReconfigurationWithSync* are always included by the target node, i.e.
they are not used for delta configuration purpose to UE.

For fields in *CG-Config* and *CG-ConfigInfo* listed below, absence of
the field means that the receiver maintains the values informed via the
previous message. Note that every time there is a change in the
configuration covered by a listed field, the MN or SN shall include the
field and it shall provide the full configuration provided by that field
unless stated otherwise. Otherwise, if there is no change, the field can
be omitted:

\- *configRestrictInfo*;

\- *gapPurpose;*

\- *measGapConfig* (for which delta signalling applies);

*- measGapConfigFR2* (for which delta signalling applies);

\- *measResultCellListSFTD*;

*- measResultSFTD-EUTRA*;

\- *sftdFrequencyList-EUTRA*;

*- sftdFrequencyList-NR;*

\- *ue-CapabilityInfo;*

*- servFrequenciesMN-NR*.

For other fields in *CG-Config* and *CG-ConfigInfo*, the sender shall
always signal the appropriate value even if same as indicated in the
previous inter-node message, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

 12 Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
===================================================

The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the
following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time
in \[ms\] from the end of reception of the network -\> UE message on the
UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of
uplink grant for the UE -\> network response message with no access
delay other than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by
scheduling, the random access procedure or physical layer
synchronisation). In case the RRC procedure triggers BWP switching, the
RRC procedure delay is the value defined in the following table plus the
BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133 \[14\], clause 8.6.3.

######## Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1

A.1 Introduction
================

The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC
protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.

A.2 Procedural specification
============================

A.2.1 General principles
------------------------

The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.

It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the
reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of
the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include
specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but
typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to
capture in the PDU clause e.g. general actions, more complicated actions
depending on the value of multiple fields.

Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE
requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that
are sent to the network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU
specification.

A.2.2 More detailed aspects
---------------------------

The following more detailed conventions should be used:

\- Bullets:

\- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets
are part of the sentence starting with \'The UE shall:\'

\- All bullets, including the last one in a clause, should end with a
semi-colon i.e. an \';.

\- Conditions:

\- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at
the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as
in \'if cond1, or cond2.

A.3 PDU specification
=====================

A.3.1 General principles
------------------------

### A.3.1.1 ASN.1 sections

The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using
abstract syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 \[6\], X.681 \[7\].

The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 sections in
the specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the
complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 section begins
with the following:

\- a first text paragraph consisting entirely of an *ASN.1 start tag*,
which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the
text string \"ASN1START\" (in all upper case letters);

\- a second text paragraph consisting entirely of a *block start tag* is
included, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space
and the text string \"TAG-NAME-START\" (in all upper case letters),
where the \"NAME\" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all
upper-case letters).

Similarly, each ASN.1 section ends with the following:

\- a first text paragraph consisting entirely of a *blockstop tag*,
which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the
text string \"TAG-NAME-STOP\" (in all upper-case letters), where the
\"NAME\" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case
letters);

\- a second text paragraph consisting entirely of an *ASN.1 stop tag*,
which consists of a double hyphen followed by a singlespace and the text
\"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters).

This results in the following tags:

\-- ASN1START

\-- TAG-NAME-START

\-- TAG-NAME-STOP

\-- ASN1STOP

The text paragraphs containing either of the start and stop tags should
not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of
the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by
copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the
following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the
specification.

NOTE: A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code
consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description
(ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII)
file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes
place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.

### A.3.1.2 ASN.1 identifier naming conventions

The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers)
should be based on the following guidelines:

\- Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without
hyphenation. These identifiers, *e.g.*, the
*RRCConnectionModificationCommand*, should be used for reference in the
procedure text. Abbreviations should be avoided in these identifiers and
abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.

\- Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed
case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent
letter is a capital, *e.g.*, *EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not
Selected-PLMN, since the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase),
InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference*.

\- Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed
case thereafter, *e.g.*, *establishmentCause*. If a field identifier
begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the
entire acronym is lowercase (*plmn-Identity*, not *pLMN-Identity*). The
acronym is set off with a hyphen (*ue-Identity*, not *ueIdentity), in
order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type
identifiers*.

\- Identifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should
avoid adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like \'Info\') for
the name.

\- Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language,
especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided
to the extent possible.

\- Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters
should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use
abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use
\'Meas\' instead of \'Measurement\' for all occurrences. Examples of
typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.

\- *For future extension:* When an extension is introduced a suffix is
added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A
suffix of the form \"‑rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for
ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release
later than the original/first release of the protocol) as well as for
ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later
release replacing a previous version, *e.g.*, *Foo-r9* for the Rel-9
version of the ASN.1 type *Foo*. A suffix of the form \"‑rXb\" is used
for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release
(X) as the original version of the field, \"‑rXc\" for a second
intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form \"‑vXYZ\" is used
for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding
earlier field or type (see clause A.4), e.g., *AnElement-v10b0* for the
extension of the ASN.1 type *AnElement* introduced in version 10.11.0 of
the specification. A number *0\...9, 10, 11, etc.* is used to represent
the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the
protocol. Lower case letters *a, b, c, etc.* are used to represent the
second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than
9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in
headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to
distinguish the extension from the original field.

\- More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different
variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of
the identifiers e.g. *MeasObjectUTRA*, *ConfigCommon*. When there is no
particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is
included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used.
This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the
same for the different variants.

\- It should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name
within the elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a
SEQUENCE (to avoid certain compiler errors).

may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.

### A.3.1.3 Text references using ASN.1 identifiers

A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts
of the specification is made using the ASN.1 field identifier of the
referenced type. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text
references should be in the *italic font style*. The \"do not check
spelling and grammar\" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks
(i.e., \"\") should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type
identifier.

A reference to an RRC PDU should be made using the corresponding ASN.1
field identifier followed by the word \"message\", e.g., a reference to
the *RRCRelease* message.

A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of
any other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"field\", e.g., a reference to the
*prioritisedBitRate* field in the example below.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {

ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {

priority Priority,

prioritisedBitRate PrioritisedBitRate,

bucketSizeDuration BucketSizeDuration,

logicalChannelGroup INTEGER (0..3)

} OPTIONAL

}

\-- ASN1STOP

NOTE: All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 sections, used as examples
in this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order
not to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents
is extracted from the specification.

A reference to a specific type of information element should be made
using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym
\"IE\", e.g., a reference to the IE *LogicalChannelConfig* in the
example above.

References to a specific type of information element should only be used
when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context
wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the
reference is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type
(message) wherein the information element is used, the corresponding
field identifier in that context should be used in the text reference.

A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using
the corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the
ASN.1 value, e.g., \'if the *status* field is set to value *true*\'.

A.3.2 High-level message structure
----------------------------------

Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types
are alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {

message DL-DCCH-MessageType

}

DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {

c1 CHOICE {

dlInformationTransfer DLInformationTransfer,

handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,

mobilityFromEUTRACommand MobilityFromEUTRACommand,

rrcConnectionReconfiguration RRCConnectionReconfiguration,

rrcConnectionRelease RRCConnectionRelease,

securityModeCommand SecurityModeCommand,

ueCapabilityEnquiry UECapabilityEnquiry,

spare1 NULL

},

messageClassExtension SEQUENCE {}

}

\-- ASN1STOP

A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU
types are alternatives within the inner level *c1* CHOICE.

Spare alternatives (i.e., *spare1* in this case) may be included within
the *c1* CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare
alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond
an integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this
case).

Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated
using the *messageClassExtension* alternative in the outer level CHOICE.

A.3.3 Message definition
------------------------

Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 section similar to the
one shown in the example below.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::= SEQUENCE {

rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

criticalExtensions CHOICE {

c1 CHOICE{

rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8 RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,

spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL

},

criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}

}

}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

\-- Enter the IEs here.

\...

}

\-- ASN1STOP

Hooks for *critical* and *non-critical* extension should normally be
included in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is
further described in clause A.4.

Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU
contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version
agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the
encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the
PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.

Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE
structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within
the inner level *c1* CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., *spare3* down to
*spare1* in this case) may be included within the *c1* CHOICE. The
number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU
specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate
of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.

Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the
original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the
*criticalExtensionsFuture* in the outer level CHOICE.

In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future
releases of the protocol, the inner level *c1* CHOICE and the spare
alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {

rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

criticalExtensions CHOICE {

rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,

criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}

}

}

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

\-- Enter the fields here.

\...

}

\-- ASN1STOP

Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new
information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not
comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder,
whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the
comprehended parts of the PDU contents.

Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message
or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING
are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"\...\". The
original specification of a PDU type should normally include the
extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements
contained.

Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a
field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by
use of an empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the
following example:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field1 InformationElement1,

field2 InformationElement2,

nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL

}

\-- ASN1STOP

The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed
by a *field description* table where a further description of, e.g., the
semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of
this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is
absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs
to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or
because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific
regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.

+-------------------------------------------+
| *%PDU-TypeIdentifier%* field descriptions |
+===========================================+
| ***%field identifier%***                  |
|                                           |
| Field description.                        |
+-------------------------------------------+
| ***%field identifier%***                  |
|                                           |
| Field description.                        |
+-------------------------------------------+

The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain
the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.

The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row
shall include a first paragraph with a *field identifier* (in ***bold
and italic*** font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it
applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in
regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other
specifications and/or specification of value units, which are relevant
for the particular part of the PDU.

The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description
shall be omitted from the field description table.

A.3.4 Information elements
--------------------------

Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 section
similar to the one shown in the example below.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-ConfigSIB ::= SEQUENCE {

rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),

prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo

}

PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {

rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),

prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL \-- Need N

}

PRACH-ConfigInfo ::= SEQUENCE {

prach-ConfigIndex ENUMERATED {ffs},

highSpeedFlag ENUMERATED {ffs},

zeroCorrelationZoneConfig ENUMERATED {ffs}

}

\-- ASN1STOP

IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which
the same set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons
e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.

A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs
*PRACH-ConfigSIB* and *PRACH-Config* in this example, are preferably
placed together in a common ASN.1 section. The IE type identifiers
should in this case have a common base, defined as the *generic type
identifier*. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the
different variants. The \"*PRACH-Config*\" is the generic type
identifier in this example, and the \"*SIB*\" suffix is added to
distinguish the variant. The clause heading and generic references to a
group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic
type identifier.

The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension
version, of an existing IE is created for *critical* or *non-critical*
extension of the protocol (see clause A.4). The new version, or the
extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 section
defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using
the naming conventions defined in clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release
or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was
introduced.

Local IE type definitions, like the IE *PRACH-ConfigInfo* in the example
above, may be included in the ASN.1 section and be referenced in the
other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 section. The use of locally
defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and
complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code.
There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the
protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the
ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software
implementation.

An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE *PRACH-ConfigInfo*,
should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 sections in the RRC
specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1
section should be defined in a separate clause, with a separate heading
and a separate ASN.1 section (possibly as one in a set of closely
related IE types, like the IEs *PRACH-ConfigSIB* and *PRACH-Config* in
the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as \'global
IEs\'.

NOTE: Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the
context of another ASN.1 section, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation
error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes
the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at
an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.

The ASN.1 section specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like
in the example above, may be followed by a *field description* table,
where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the
fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be
absent, similar as indicated in clause A.3.3 for the specification of
the PDU type. The general format of the *field description* table is the
same as shown in clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.

A.3.5 Fields with optional presence
-----------------------------------

A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT.
It identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not
include a value for that field in the encoding:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

PreambleInfo ::= SEQUENCE {

numberOfRA-Preambles INTEGER (1..64) DEFAULT 1,

\...

}

\-- ASN1STOP

Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the
keyword OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be
omitted. The omission carries semantics, which is different from any
normal value of the field:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {

rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),

prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL \-- Need N

}

\-- ASN1STOP

The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted,
should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword
OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need code. The need code
includes the keyword \"Need\", followed by one of the predefined
semantics tags (S, M, N or R) defined in clause 6.1. If the semantics
tag S is used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified
either in the field description table following the ASN.1 section, or in
procedure text.

The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the
following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level
IE, then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only
one field in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the
group level.

A.3.6 Fields with conditional presence
--------------------------------------

A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL.
In addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the
paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the
keyword \"Cond\", followed by a condition tag associated with the field
(\"UL\" in this example):

\-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {

ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {

priority INTEGER (0),

\...

} OPTIONAL \-- Cond UL

}

\-- ASN1STOP

When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 section, the
field description table after the ASN.1 section shall be followed by a
*conditional presence* table. The conditional presence table specifies
the conditions for including the fields with conditional presence in the
particular ASN.1 section.

  Conditional presence   Explanation
  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  UL                     Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the condition tag = \"UL\". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.

The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column
(heading: \"Conditional presence\") contains the condition tag (in
*italic* font style), which links the fields with a condition tag in the
ASN.1 section to an entry in the table. The second column (heading:
\"Explanation\") contains a text specification of the conditions and
requirements for the presence of the field. The second column may also
include semantics, in case of an optional presence of the field, under
certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined tags as defined for
optional fields in A.3.5.

Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field
depends on the presence and/or value of other fields within the same
message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another
feature/function has been configured, while this function can be
configured independently e.g. by another message and/or at another point
in time, the relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the
field description table.

If the ASN.1 section does not include any fields with conditional
presence, the conditional presence table shall not be included.

Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of
conditional presence should be considered.

A.3.7 Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
---------------------------------------------------------------

Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF
construct in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE
data type, an information element shall be defined for the list elements
even if it would not otherwise be needed.

For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined
as in the following example:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo

PLMN-IdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE {

plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,

cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}

}

\-- ASN1STOP

rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated
code to contain types with unpredictable names:

\-- /bad example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {

plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,

cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}

}

\-- ASN1STOP

A.3.8 Guidelines on use of parameterised SetupRelease type
----------------------------------------------------------

The usage of the parameterised *SetupRelease* type is like a function
call in programming languages where the element type parameter is passed
as a parameter. The parameterised type only implies a textual change in
abstract syntax where all references to the parameterised type are
replaced by the compiler with the release/setup choice. Two examples of
the usage are shown below:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field-rX SetupRelease { IE-rX } OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

\...

}

RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field-rX SetupRelease { Element-rX }

} OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

Element-rX ::= SEQUENCE {

field1-rX IE1-rX,

field2-rX IE2-rX OPTIONAL \-- Need N

} OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

\-- /example/ ASN1STOP

The *SetupRelease* is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the
example below is not allowed:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field-rX SetupRelease { SEQUENCE { \-- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not
allowed!

field1-rX IE1-rX,

field2-rX IE2-rX OPTIONAL \-- Need N

}

} OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

}

\-- /example/ ASN1STOP

If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires
procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for
the type itself, namely, \"setup\" and \"release\". For example,
procedural text for field-rX above could be as follows:

1\> if *field-rX* is set to \"setup\":

2\> do something;

1\> else (*field-rX* is set to \"release\"):

2\> release *field-rX* (if appropriate).

A.3.9 Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList
---------------------------------------------------------

In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many
and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be
used. Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the
ASN.1 provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements
that are to be added to the list or modified in the list. The second
list conveys only the identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to
be released from the list. In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means
to signal modifications to a list maintained in the receiver (typically
the UE). An example is provided below:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

AnExampleIE ::= SEQUENCE {

elementsToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element
OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

elementsToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId
OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

\...

}

Element ::= SEQUENCE {

elementId ElementId,

aField INTEG ER (0..16777215),

anotherField OCTET STRING,

\...

}

ElementId ::= INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)

maxNrofElements INTEGER ::= 50

maxNrofElements-1 INTEGER ::= 49

\-- /example/ ASN1STOP

As can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity
(INTEGER) that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition,
modification and removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that
identifier (here ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field
inside the element as well as in the *elementsToReleaseList*.

Both lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as \"Need N\". The need
code reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such
but rather updates its configuration using the information therein. In
other words, it is not possible to provide via delta signalling an
update to a previously signalled *elementsToAddModList* or
elementsToReleaseList (which Need M would imply). The update is always
in relation to the UE\'s internal configuration.

Note that the release of a field (a list element as well as any other
field) releases all its sub-fields (sub-fields configured by
elementsToAddModList and any other sub-field).

If no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and
ToReleaseList, the following generic procedure applies:

The UE shall:

1\> for each *ElementId* in the *elementsToReleaseList*,:

2\> if the current UE configuration includes an *Element* with the given
*ElementId*:

3\> release the *Element* from the current UE configuration;

1\> for each *Element* in the *elementsToAddModList*:

2\> if the current UE configuration includes an *Element* with the given
*ElementId*:

3\> modify the configured *Element* in accordance with the received
*Element*;

2\> else:

3\> add received *Element* to the UE configuration.

A.3.10 Guidelines on use of of lists (without ToAddModList and ToReleaseList)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As per clause 6.1.3, when using lists without the ToAddModList and
ToReleaseList structure, the contents of the lists are always replaced.
To illustrate this, an example is provided below:

\-- /example/ ASN1START

\-- TAG\_EXAMPLE\_LISTS\_START

AnExampleIE ::= SEQUENCE {

elementList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element OPTIONAL,
\-- Need M

\...,

\[\[

elementListExt-v2030 SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElementsExt)) OF Element
OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

\]\]

}

Element ::= SEQUENCE {

useFeatureX BOOLEAN,

aField INTEGER (0..127) OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

anotherField INTEGER (0..127) OPTIONAL, \-- Need R

\...

}

maxNrofElements INTEGER ::= 8

maxNrofElements-1 INTEGER ::= 7

maxNrofElementsExt INTEGER ::= 8

maxNrofElementsExt-1 INTEGER ::= 7

\-- TAG\_EXAMPLE\_LISTS\_STOP

\-- /example/ ASN1STOP

As can be seen, the *elementList* list itself uses Need M, but each list
entry *Element* contains mandatory, Need M and Need R fields. If the
list is first signalled to UE with 3 entries, and subsequently again
with 2 entries, UE shall retain only the latter list, i.e. the list with
2 elements will completely replace the list with 3 elements. That also
means that the field *aField* will be treated as if it was newly
created, i.e. network must include it if it wishes UE to utilize the
field even if it was previously signalled. This also implies that the
Need M field (*aField*) will be treated in the same way as the Need R
field (*anotherField*), i.e. delta signalling is not applied and the
network has to signal the field to ensure UE does not release the value
(which is why Need M should not normally be used in the entries of these
lists).

A.4 Extension of the PDU specifications
=======================================

A.4.1 General principles to ensure compatibility
------------------------------------------------

It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect
interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on
different versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In
particular, this requirement applies for the following kind of protocol
extensions:

\- Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected
behaviour or damage).

\- Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it
should be possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting
the handling of the other parts of the message).

\- Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If
used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be
defined.

It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the
logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an
implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which
case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.

The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for
introducing protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is
used merely when there is a need to introduce a \'clean\' message
version. Such a need appears when the last message version includes a
large number of non-critical extensions, which results in issues like
readability, overhead associated with the extension markers. The
critical extension mechanism may also be considered when it is
complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical
extension mechanisms.

A.4.2 Critical extension of messages and fields
-----------------------------------------------

The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3.
There are both \"outer branch\" and \"inner branch\" mechanisms
available. The \"outer branch\" consists of a CHOICE having the name
*criticalExtensions*, with two values, *c1* and
*criticalExtensionsFuture*. The *criticalExtensionsFuture* branch
consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the \"inner
branch\" mechanism.

The \"inner branch\" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form
\"*MessageName-rX-IEs*\" (e.g.,
\"*RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs*\") or \"*spareX*\", with the
spare values having type NULL. The \"-rX-IEs\" structures contain the
*complete* structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release;
i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message
includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later
version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.

The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to
introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an \'outer branch\', or an
\'outer branch\' in combination with an \'inner branch\' including a
certain number of spares:

\- For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages
transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be
applicable.

\- An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any
fields.

\- The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the
likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future
releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message
consumes one of the spare values). The estimation of the critical
extension likelihood may be based on the number, size and changeability
of the fields included in the message.

\- In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available,
all spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical
extensions are added using the outer branch.

The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension
mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release

\-- /example/ ASN1START \-- Original release

RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {

rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

criticalExtensions CHOICE {

c1 CHOICE{

rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,

spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL

},

criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}

}

}

\-- ASN1STOP

\-- /example/ ASN1START \-- Later release

RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {

rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

criticalExtensions CHOICE {

c1 CHOICE{

rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,

rrcMessage-r10 RRCMessage-r10-IEs,

rrcMessage-r11 RRCMessage-r11-IEs,

rrcMessage-r14 RRCMessage-r14-IEs

},

later CHOICE {

c2 CHOICE{

rrcMessage-r16 RRCMessage-r16-IEs,

spare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,

spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL

},

criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}

}

}

}

\-- ASN1STOP

It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the
level of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically
extended version. When sending the extended version, the original
version may also be included (e.g. original field is mandatory, E-UTRAN
is unaware if UE supports the extended version). In such cases, a UE
supporting both versions may be required to ignore the original field.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension
mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release.

\-- /example/ ASN1START \-- Original release

RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {

rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,

criticalExtensions CHOICE {

c1 CHOICE{

rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,

},

criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}

}

}

RRCMessage-rN-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

value1, value2, value3, value4} OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

field2-rN InformationElement2-rN OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

nonCriticalExtension RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs OPTIONAL

}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field2-rM InformationElement2-rM OPTIONAL, \-- Cond NoField2rN

nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL

}

\-- ASN1STOP

  Conditional presence   Explanation
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *NoField2rN*           The field is optionally present, need N, if field2-rN is absent. Otherwise the field is absent

Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the
same release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g.
to correct an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may
be introduced, to assist the network in deciding whether or not to use
the critical extension.

A.4.3 Non-critical extension of messages
----------------------------------------

### A.4.3.1 General principles

The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined
in A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional
guidelines apply:

\- When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has
been critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions
in earlier critical branches of the message should be avoided when
possible.

\- The extension marker (\"\...\") is the primary non-critical extension
mechanism that is used but empty sequences may be used if length
determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length
determinant is not required:

\- at the end of a message;

\- at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.

\- When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are
preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned
parameter belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as
the \'*default extension location*\').

\- It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or
version of the specification into a group, which should be placed at the
lowest possible level.

\- In specific cases it may be preferable to place extensions elsewhere
(referred to as the \'*actual extension location*\') e.g. when it is
possible to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the
group should be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.

\- In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier
critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following
higher level in the message should be considered.

\- In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location,
an IE should be defined. The IE\'s ASN.1 definition should be placed in
the same ASN.1 section as the default extension location. In case there
are intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension
location, an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are
primarily introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate
levels need not always be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when
the default and the actual extension location are within the same ASN.1
section.

### A.4.3.2 Further guidelines

Further to the general principles defined in the previous section, the
following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension
markers:

\- Extension markers within SEQUENCE:

\- Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at
the higher nesting levels.

\- Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several
fields as well as for information elements whose extension would result
in complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list).

\- Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain
important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one
particular RAT.

\- Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e.
messages on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat
more carefully.

\- The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of
the specification are grouped together using double brackets.

\- Extension markers within ENUMERATED:

\- Spare values may be used until the number of values reaches the next
power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that
limit, given that the use of spare values in a later Release is possible
without any error cases.

\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new
value, e.g. \"value-vXYZ\".

\- Extension markers within CHOICE:

\- Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when
comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined
for the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value
(e.g. ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that
defining the behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended
choice value is not required if the sender is aware whether or not the
receiver supports the extended value.

\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new
choice value, e.g. \"choice-vXYZ\".

Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in
an OCTET or BIT STRING:

\- When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a \"Need\" code should
not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at
least one extension and a field facilitating further possible
extensions. For simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a \"Need\"
code when the field is not actually used either.

Further, more general, guidelines:

\- In case a need code is not provided for a group, a \"Need\" code is
provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e.
including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to
clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.

### A.4.3.3 Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions

The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a
number of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example
also illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical
extension mechanism is used.

NOTE In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n
while the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the
release n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more
advanced mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension
markers.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

field1 ENUMERATED {

value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,

\..., value5-v960 },

field2 CHOICE {

\...,

field2c-v960 InformationElement2c-r9

},

\...,

\[\[

field3-r9 InformationElement3-r9 OPTIONAL \-- Need R

\]\],

\[\[

field3-v9a0 InformationElement3-v9a0 OPTIONAL, \-- Need R

field4-r9 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL \-- Need R

\]\]

}

InformationElement1-r10 ::= SEQUENCE {

field1 ENUMERATED {

value1, value2, value3, value4-v880,

value5-v960, value6-v1170, spare2, spare1, \... },

field2 CHOICE {

field2a BOOLEAN,

field2b InformationElement2b,

field2c-v960 InformationElement2c-r9,

\...,

\...,

\[\[

field3-v1170 InformationElement3-v1170 OPTIONAL \-- Need R

\]\]

}

\-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions of *InformationElement1* as shown
in the above example:

-- The *InformationElement1* is initially extended with a number of
non-critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is
introduced for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of
the IE *InformationElement1* (i.e. *InformationElement1-r10*) is defined
in which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means
of a revision of the original field.

-- The *value4-v880* is replacing a spare value defined in the original
protocol version for *field1*. Likewise *value6-v1170* replaces *spare3*
that was originally defined in the r10 version of *field1.*

-- Within the critically extended release 10 version of
*InformationElement1*, the names of the original fields/IEs are not
changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other
fields/IEs. E.g. the *field1* and *InformationElement4* were defined in
the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged.
Moreover, the *field3-r9* is introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged;
although, the *InformationElement3* is also critically extended and
therefore tagged *InformationElement3-r10* in the release 10 version of
InformationElement1.

### A.4.3.4 Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message

The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at
the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a
BIT or OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field1 InformationElement1,

field2 InformationElement2,

field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v860-IEs OPTIONAL

}

RRCMessage-v860-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field4-v860 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, \-- Need S

field5-v860 BOOLEAN OPTIONAL, \-- Cond C54

nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v940-IEs OPTIONAL

}

RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

field6-v940 InformationElement6-r9 OPTIONAL, \-- Need R

nonCriticalExtensions SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL

}

\-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:

-- The *InformationElement4* is introduced in the original version of
the protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.

### A.4.3.5 Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default extension location

The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in
case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.

#### -- *ParentIE-WithEM*

The IE *ParentIE-WithEM*is an example of a high level IE including the
extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower
level IEs *ChildIE1-WithoutEM* and *ChildIE2-WithoutEM* which not
include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of
the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.

The example illustrates how the two extension IEs
*ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0* and *ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0* (both in release
N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension
location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this
IE.

***ParentIE-WithEM*** information element

\-- /example/ ASN1START

ParentIE-WithEM ::= SEQUENCE {

\-- Root encoding, including:

childIE1-WithoutEM ChildIE1-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

childIE2-WithoutEM ChildIE2-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

\...,

\[\[

childIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL, \-- Need N

childIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL \-- Need N

\]\]

}

\-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:

-- The fields *childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0* may not really need to be
optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).

-- In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields
should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.

#### *-- ChildIE1-WithoutEM*

The IE *ChildIE1-WithoutEM* is an example of a lower level IE, used to
control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature
which can be setup or released using the local IE
*ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature*. The example illustrates how the new field
*chIE1-NewField* is added in release N to the configuration of the
configurable feature. The example is based on the following assumptions:

-- When initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field,
the original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also
i.e. as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of
this feature.

-- When the configurable feature is released, the new field should be
released also.

-- When omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE
continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the
signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon
handover).

-- When omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE
releases the existing values and discontinues the associated
functionality (which may be used to support release of unsupported
functionality upon handover to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol
version).

The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need
codes, may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used
blindly.

***ChildIE1-WithoutEM*** information element

\-- /example/ ASN1START

ChildIE1-WithoutEM ::= SEQUENCE {

\-- Root encoding, including:

ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature ::= CHOICE {

  *ConfigF*              The field is optional present, need R, in case of chIE1-ConfigurableFeature is included and set to \"setup\"; otherwise the field is absent and the UE shall delete any existing value for this field.

#### *-- ChildIE2-WithoutEM*

The IE *ChildIE2-WithoutEM* is an example of a lower level IE, typically
used to control certain radio configurations. The example illustrates
how the new field *chIE1-NewField* is added in release N to the
configuration of the configurable feature.

***ChildIE2-WithoutEM*** information element

\-- /example/ ASN1START

ChildIE2-WithoutEM ::= CHOICE {

release NULL,

\-- Root encoding

}

}

ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 ::= SEQUENCE {

chIE2-NewField-rN INTEGER (0..31) OPTIONAL \-- Cond ConfigF

}

  *ConfigF*              The field is optional present, need R, in case of chIE2-ConfigurableFeature is included and set to \"setup\"; otherwise the field is absent and the UE shall delete any existing value for this field.

A.5 Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC messages
=============================================================================

The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a
Transaction identifier

1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the
RRC transaction identifier.

2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC
transaction identifier.

3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC
Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.

4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should
include an RRC transaction identifier.

5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require
a corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC
Transaction identifier.

A.6 Guidelines regarding use of need codes
==========================================

The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for
optional downlink fields:

\- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when
absent:

\- use Need M (=Maintain);

\- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:

\- use Need R (=Release);

\- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE
does not even need to maintain any existing value of the field):

\- use Need N (=None);

\- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above
conditions):

\- use Need S (=Specified);

\- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural
text or in the field description table.

A.7 Guidelines regarding use of conditions
==========================================

Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which
the following types can be distinguished:

\- Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field B is mandatory
present if the same message includes field A and when it is set value X.

\- Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field D can only be signalled
if field C is configured and set to value Y. (i.e. regardless of whether
field C is present in the same message or previously configured).

The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.

\-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {

fieldA FieldA OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

fieldB FieldB OPTIONAL, \-- Cond FieldAsetToX

fieldC FieldC OPTIONAL, \-- Need M

fieldD FieldD OPTIONAL, \-- Cond FieldCsetToY

nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL

}

\-- /example/ ASN1STOP

  *Conditional presence*   *Explanation*
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *FieldAsetToX*           The field is mandatory present if fieldA is included and set to valueX. Otherwise the field is optionally present, need R.
  *FieldCsetToY*           The field is optionally present, need M, if fieldC is configured and set to valueY. Otherwise the field is absent and the UE does not maintain the value

A.8 Miscellaneous
=================

The following miscellaneous convention should be used:

\- UE capabilities: TS 38.306 \[26\] specifies that the network should
in general respect the UE\'s capabilities. Hence there is no need to
include statement clarifying that the network, when setting the value of
a certain configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities
unless there is a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.

B.2 Description of BWP configuration options
============================================

There are two possible ways to configure BWP\#0 (i.e. the initial BWP)
for a UE:

1\) Configure *BWP-DownlinkCommon* and *BWP-UplinkCommon* in
*ServingCellConfigCommon*, but do not configure dedicated configurations
in *BWP-DownlinkDedicated* or *BWP-UplinkDedicated* in
*ServingCellConfig*.

2\) Configure both *BWP-DownlinkCommon* and *BWP-UplinkCommon* in
*ServingCellConfigCommon* and configure dedicated configurations in at
least one of *BWP-DownlinkDedicated* or *BWP-UplinkDedicated* in
*ServingCellConfig*.

The same way of configuration is used for UL BWP\#0 and DL BWP\#0 if
both are configured.

With the first option (illustrated by figure B2-1 below), the BWP\#0 is
not considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one
BWP can still be configured with BWP\#1 in addition to BWP\#0 when using
this configuration. The BWP\#0 can still be used even if it does not
have the dedicated configuration, albeit in a more limited manner since
only the SIB1-defined configurations are available. For example, only
DCI format 1\_0 can be used with BWP\#0 without dedicated configuration,
so changing to another BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format
1\_0 doesn\'t support DCI-based switching.

Figure B2-1: BWP\#0 configuration without dedicated configuration

With the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP\#0 is
considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP
cannot be configured with BWP\#1 in addition to BWP\#0 when using this
configuration. However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch
to and from BWP\#0 e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit
limitations to using the BWP\#0 (compared to the first option).

Figure B2-2: BWP\#0 configuration with dedicated configuration

For BWP\#0, the *BWP-DownlinkCommon* and *BWP-UplinkCommon* in
*ServingCellConfigCommon* should match the parameters configured by MIB
and SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.
