This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies requirements for Rel-15 UEs supporting
release independent features like:

\- additional NR operating bands and power classes on top of Rel-15 of
TS 38.101 \[2-5\] and TS 38.133 \[6\];

2 References

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**release independent**: applicable to some frozen releases, starting
from a certain release Rel-M

NOTE 1: Normally, a feature is introduced only in the latest open
release Rel-N and future releases are based on the previous one so that
future releases inherit the requirements of this feature. Introducing a
feature \"in a release independent way from Rel-M onwards\" (M\<N) means
it was decided by TSG RAN that this feature would be also beneficial in
previous, already frozen releases starting with Rel-M until Rel-(N-1).
In order to avoid touching TS 38.101 \[2-5\] or TS 38.133 \[6\] of these
frozen releases, the corresponding requirements are captured in TS
38.307 via pointers to \[2-5\] or \[6\] of the release in which the
feature was introduced.

NOTE 2: Release independent does not mean applicable to all releases.

3.2 Symbols
-----------

For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:

N Release in which a feature is introduced into TS 38.101 \[2-5\] or TS
38.133 \[6\]

M Release from which onwards (including release M) a feature is release
independent

3.3 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

BW Bandwidth

CA Carrier Aggregation

CC Component carrier

DL Downlink

EN-DC Dual connectivity between E-UTRA and NR

FDD Frequency Division Duplex

SDL Supplementary downlink

SUL Supplementary uplink

TDD Time Division Duplex

UE User Equipment

4 General
=========

TSG-RAN has agreed for certain features (see the following clauses) to
introduce them in a \"release independent way\".

This means for each feature:

\- it is \"introduced\" in a release N, i.e. TS 38.101 \[2-5\] and TS
38.133 \[6\] of release N define certain UE requirements for this
feature; the feature is indicated in the tables of the following
clauses;

\- it is \"release independent\" starting from a release M (M\<N); M for
the given feature is provided in the tables of the following clauses;

\- UEs supporting this feature have to fulfil additional requirements in
release M or higher which are specified in one or more Annexes of TS
38.307 of release N; the applicable Annexes for a given feature are
provided in the tables of the following clauses.

The applicable UE Categories are specified in TS 38.306 \[7\] according
to the release to which the UE conforms.

In the table of release independent features in subsequent clauses,
\"FDD, TDD\" refers to CA or EN-DC configuration composed by only FDD
bands or only TDD bands, respectively. \"FDD and TDD\" refers to CA or
EN-DC configuration including both FDD and TDD bands. \"SDL and FDD, SDL
and TDD\" refers to CA configuration including both SDL and FDD bands or
both SDL and TDD bands, respectively. \"TDD and SUL\" refers to SUL
configuration including both TDD and SUL bands. \"FDD and TDD and SUL\"
refers to EN-DC configuration including both FDD, TDD and SUL bands.
Unless stated otherwise, the release independent for the band
combinations are from Rel-15.

When a new feature is introduced only the latest release of release
independent spec needs to be updated. The latest release of release
independent spec refers to the release which the new feature is
introduced in. If an RF feature introduced in the same release as the
release which the feature is independent from, (i.e. M=N), the common UE
RF requirements table in annex B.4 is specified from release N+1,
otherwise the common UE RF requirements table is specified from release
N.

5 Release independent features for NR frequency range 1
=======================================================

5.1 Additional NR operating bands and UE power classes for NR frequency range 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements for a Rel-15 UE for additional NR operating bands power
classes and UE channel bandwidth compared to TS 38.101-1 of Rel-15 \[2\]
are introduced via this clause.

########  Annex A (informative): Frequency arrangement for overlapping operating bands

The following information is provided in order to assist a UE derive the
DL NR-ARFCN and UL NR-ARFCN in a multi-band environment, in which
multiple overlapping operating bands may be indicated in the fields
*freqBandIndicatorNR* and *MultiFrequencyBandListNR-SIB*.

The overlapping bands, independent of release, which may be indicated in
a cell are shown in Table A-1 for applicable NR operating bands. The DL
NR-ARFCN and UL NR-ARFCN are derived according to TS 38.101-1 Rel-15.
