4 Control of UE/NG-RAN measurements
===================================

In this chapter the general measurement control concept of the higher
layers is briefly described to provide an understanding on how L1
measurements are initiated and controlled by higher layers.

With the measurement specifications L1 provides measurement capabilities
for the UE and NG-RAN. These measurements can be classified in different
reported measurement types: intra-frequency, inter-frequency,
inter-system, traffic volume, quality and UE internal measurements.

In the L1 measurement definitions, see chapter 5, the measurements are
categorised as measurements in the UE or measurements in the NG-RAN.

### 5.1.1 SS reference signal received power (SS-RSRP)

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | SS reference signal received power (SS-RSRP)   |
|                    | is defined as the linear average over the      |
|                    | power contributions (in \[W\]) of the resource |
|                    | elements that carry secondary synchronization  |
|                    | signals. The measurement time resource(s) for  |
|                    | SS-RSRP are confined within SS/PBCH Block      |
|                    | Measurement Time Configuration (SMTC) window   |
|                    | duration. If SS-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP as    |
|                    | configured by reporting configurations as      |
|                    | defined in TS 38.214 \[6\], the measurement    |
|                    | time resources(s) restriction by SMTC window   |
|                    | duration is not applicable.                    |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For SS-RSRP determination demodulation         |
|                    | reference signals for physical broadcast       |
|                    | channel (PBCH) and, if indicated by higher     |
|                    | layers, CSI reference signals in addition to   |
|                    | secondary synchronization signals may be used. |
|                    | SS-RSRP using demodulation reference signal    |
|                    | for PBCH or CSI reference signal shall be      |
|                    | measured by linear averaging over the power    |
|                    | contributions of the resource elements that    |
|                    | carry corresponding reference signals taking   |
|                    | into account power scaling for the reference   |
|                    | signals as defined in TS 38.213 \[5\]. If      |
|                    | SS-RSRP is not used for L1-RSRP, the           |
|                    | additional use of CSI reference signals for    |
|                    | SS-RSRP determination is not applicable.       |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | SS-RSRP shall be measured only among the       |
|                    | reference signals corresponding to SS/PBCH     |
|                    | blocks with the same SS/PBCH block index and   |
|                    | the same physical-layer cell identity.         |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | If SS-RSRP is not used for L1-RSRP and         |
|                    | higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH blocks  |
|                    | for performing SS-RSRP measurements, then      |
|                    | SS-RSRP is measured only from the indicated    |
|                    | set of SS/PBCH block(s).                       |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For frequency range 1, the reference point for |
|                    | the SS-RSRP shall be the antenna connector of  |
|                    | the UE. For frequency range 2, SS-RSRP shall   |
|                    | be measured based on the combined signal from  |
|                    | antenna elements corresponding to a given      |
|                    | receiver branch. For frequency range 1 and 2,  |
|                    | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the |
|                    | reported SS-RSRP value shall not be lower than |
|                    | the corresponding SS-RSRP of any of the        |
|                    | individual receiver branches.                  |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Applicable for** | If SS-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP,                |
|                    |                                                |

|                    |                                                |
|                    | Otherwise,                                     |
|                    |                                                |

NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the measurement period
that are used by the UE to determine SS-RSRP is left up to the UE
implementation with the limitation that corresponding measurement
accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.

NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy
received during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

### 5.1.2 CSI reference signal received power (CSI-RSRP)

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | CSI reference signal received power            |
|                    | (CSI-RSRP), is defined as the linear average   |
|                    | over the power contributions (in \[W\]) of the |
|                    | resource elements of the antenna port(s) that  |
|                    | carry CSI reference signals configured for     |
|                    | RSRP measurements within the considered        |
|                    | measurement frequency bandwidth in the         |
|                    | configured CSI-RS occasions.                   |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For CSI-RSRP determination CSI reference       |
|                    | signals transmitted on antenna port 3000       |
|                    | according to TS 38.211 \[4\] shall be used. If |
|                    | CSI-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP, CSI reference    |
|                    | signals transmitted on antenna ports 3000,     |
|                    | 3001 can be used for CSI-RSRP determination.   |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For intra-frequency CSI-RSRP measurements, if  |
|                    | the measurement gap is not configured, UE is   |
|                    | not expected to measure the CSI-RS resource(s) |
|                    | outside of the active downlink bandwidth part. |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For frequency range 1, the reference point for |
|                    | the CSI-RSRP shall be the antenna connector of |
|                    | the UE. For frequency range 2, CSI-RSRP shall  |

|                    | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the |
|                    | reported CSI-RSRP value shall not be lower     |
|                    | than the corresponding CSI-RSRP of any of the  |
|                    | individual receiver branches.                  |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Applicable for** | If CSI-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP,               |
|                    |                                                |

NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the considered
measurement frequency bandwidth and within the measurement period that
are used by the UE to determine CSI-RSRP is left up to the UE
implementation with the limitation that corresponding measurement
accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.

NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy
received during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | Secondary synchronization signal reference     |
|                    | signal received quality (SS-RSRQ) is defined   |
|                    | as the ratio of N×SS-RSRP / NR carrier RSSI,   |
|                    | where N is the number of resource blocks in    |
|                    | the NR carrier RSSI measurement bandwidth. The |
|                    | measurements in the numerator and denominator  |
|                    | shall be made over the same set of resource    |
|                    | blocks.                                        |

### 5.1.18 SS reference signal received power per branch (SS-RSRPB)

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | SS reference signal received power per branch  |
|                    | (SS-RSRPB) is defined as the linear average    |
|                    | over the power contributions (in \[W\]) of the |
|                    | resource elements that carry secondary         |
|                    | synchronization signals (SS). The measurement  |
|                    | time resource(s) for SS-RSRPB are confined     |
|                    | within SS/PBCH Block Measurement Time          |
|                    | Configuration (SMTC) window duration.          |
|                    |                                                |

|                    | synchronization signals may be used. SS-RSRPB  |
|                    | using demodulation reference signal for PBCH   |
|                    | shall be measured by linear averaging over the |
|                    | power contributions of the resource elements   |
|                    | that carry corresponding reference signals     |
|                    | taking into account power scaling for the      |
|                    | reference signals as defined in TS 38.213      |
|                    | \[5\].                                         |

|                    | reference signals corresponding to SS/PBCH     |
|                    | blocks with the same SS/PBCH block index and   |
|                    | the same physical-layer cell identity.         |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | If higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH      |
|                    | blocks for performing SS-RSRPB measurements,   |
|                    | then SS-RSRPB is measured only from the        |
|                    | indicated set of SS/PBCH block(s).             |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For frequency range 1, SS-RSRPB is not         |
|                    | defined. For frequency range 2, SS-RSRPB shall |
|                    | be measured for each receiver branch based on  |
|                    | the combined signal from antenna elements      |
|                    | corresponding to the receiver branch.          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Applicable for** | RRC\_CONNECTED intra-frequency                 |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the measurement period
that are used by the UE to determine SS-RSRPB is left up to the UE
implementation with the limitation that corresponding measurement
accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.

NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy
received during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

NOTE 3: This UE measurement is defined only for conformance test
purposes. It is described along with test control entity signalling in
\[14\].

+----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition** | SSS transmit power is determined as the linear     |
|                | average over the power contributions (in \[W\]) of |
|                | the resource elements that carry secondary         |
|                | synchronization signals within the secondary       |
|                | synchronization signal (SSS) bandwidth.            |
|                |                                                    |
