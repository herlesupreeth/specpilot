7 NR band 4.4-5.0 GHz issues

### 7.1.1 Transmitter characteristics

#### 7.1.1.1 UE maximum output power

The MOP requirements for Band 42 and 43 single-carrier were specified as
23 dBm +2/-3 dB for power class 3 based on simulation results shown in
Table 7.1.1.1-1 in August 2011.

From these tables, no significant filter IL degradation for Band n79 can
be seen compared to that of Band 42 and 43 at ETC condition. Therefore,
MOP for Band n79 should be aligned with those of Band 42 and 43 at
least.

Agreement: MOP for Band n79 is to be 23 dBm +2/-3 dB

### 7.1.2 Receiver characteristics

#### 7.1.2.1 Reference sensitivity

With the same investigation as UE maximum output power described in
7.1.1.1, no significant filter IL degradation for Band n79 can be seen
compared to that of Band 42 and 43 at ETC condition. In addition, from
LNA perspective, the fractional bandwidth of Band n79 pass-band is 12.8
% which is smaller than that of Band n78 (14.1 %). Hence, NF of Band n79
shouldn't be higher than that of Band n78. Therefore, reference
sensitivity for Band n79 should also be aligned with those of Band n78
at least.

Agreement: REFSENS for Band n79 should be 1 dB larger than that of bands
which have NR smallest sensitivity (less RF challenges) such as Band n1.

#### 7.1.2.2 Blocking

##### 7.1.2.2.1 Out-of-band blocking

Based on filter performance shown in Table 7.1.1.1-1 and 7.1.1.1-2,
out-of-band blocking requirement needs to be optimized as with LTE band
42 and 43 as below.
