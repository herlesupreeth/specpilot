 4 General
=========

4.1 Relationship with other core specifications
-----------------------------------------------

The present document is a single-RAT specification for a BS, covering RF
characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conducted and
radiated core requirements are defined for the BS architectures and BS
types defined in clause 4.3.

The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 5.

4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS
38.141-1 \[5\] and TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.141-1 \[5\]
and TS 38.141-2 \[6\] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are
individually calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to
relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test
requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements,
the test tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
\[7\].

4.3 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
-------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 *BS type 1-C*

For *BS type 1-C*, the requirements are applied at the BS *antenna
connector* (port A) for a single transmitter or receiver with a full
complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
conditions. If any external apparatus such as an amplifier, a filter or
the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far
end *antenna connector* (port B).

![](./media/image5.emf){width="6.5in" height="2.0in"}

Figure 4.3.1-2: *BS type 1-C* receiver interface

### 4.3.2 *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-H*, the requirements are defined for two points of
reference, signified by radiated requirements and conducted
requirements.

Figure 4.3.2-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *BS type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
*operating band* specific radiated interface is referred to as the
*Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which
the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

### 4.3.3 *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*

For *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*, the radiated characteristics are
defined over the air (OTA), where the *operating band* specific radiated
interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB).
Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The
(spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

Figure 4.3.3-1: Radiated reference points for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type
2-O*

Co-location requirements are specified at the conducted interface of the
*co-location reference antenna*, the c*o-location reference antenna*
does not form part of the BS under test but is a means to provide OTA
power levels which are representative of a co-located system, further
defined in clause 4.9.

For a *BS type 1-O* the transceiver unit array must contain at least 8
transmitter units and at least 8 receiver units. Transmitter units and
receiver units may be combined into transceiver units. The
transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.

4.4 Base station classes
------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated. The associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly
the same for BS with and without connectors.

For BS *type 1-O* and 2-O, BS classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m.

For *BS type 1-C* and 1-H, BS classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
70 dB.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals
to 53 dB.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
45 dB.

4.5 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

4.7 Requirements for contiguous and *non-contiguous spectrum*
-------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both *contiguous spectrum*
operation and non-*contiguous spectrum* operation.

For BS operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, some requirements apply
both at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges and inside the *sub-block
gaps*. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges and the *sub-block*
edges respectively.

4.8 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
-------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band connector* or *multi-band* *RIB*, the RF requirements in
clause 6, 7, 9 and 10 apply separately to each supported *operating
band* unless otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly
stated that specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at
*multi-band connector(s)*, and *multi-band RIB(s)* as detailed in the
requirement clause. For *BS* capable of multi-band operation, various
structures in terms of combinations of different transmitter and
receiver implementations (multi-band or single band) with mapping of
transceivers to one or more *antenna* *connectors* for *BS type 1-C* or
*TAB connectors* for *BS type 1-H* in different ways are possible. For
*multi-band connector(s)* the exclusions or provisions for multi-band
apply. For *single-band connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to this *connector* configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are
applicable. Single-band requirements are tested separately at the
*connector* configured for single-band operation, with all other
*antenna connectors* terminated.

A *BS type 1-H* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations of *TAB
connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All *TAB connectors* are *single-band connectors*.

\- Different sets of *single-band connectors* support different
*operating bands*, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in
one single *operating band*.

\- Sets of *single-band connectors* support operation in multiple
*operating bands* with some *single-band connectors* supporting more
than one *operating band*.

\- All *TAB connectors* are multi-band *connectors*.

\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of *TAB
connectors* provides support of the type *BS type 1-H* capability of
operation in multiple *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an *operating
band* apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting that
*operating band*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *single-band
connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group*, *single-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB
connectors*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *multi-band
connector*s supporting the same *operating band* combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

The case of an *operating band* being supported by both *multi-band
connectors* and *single-band connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell
group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* and is not covered by the
present release of this specification.

The case of an *operating band* being supported by *multi-band
connectors* which are not all supporting the same *operating band*
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

*BS type 1-O* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations at the
*radiated interface boundary*:

\- All RIBs are *single-band RIBs*.

\- All RIBs are *multi-band* *RIBs*.

\- A combination of single-band *RIBs* and *multi-band RIBs* provides
support of the *BS type 1-O* capability of operation in multiple
*operating bands*.

For *multi-band connectors* and *multi-band RIBs* supporting the bands
for TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume no
simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.

The RF requirements for *multi-band connectors* and *multi-band RIBs*
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present
release of this specification.

4.9 OTA co-location with other base stations
--------------------------------------------

Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming
the *BS type 1-O* is co-located with another BS of the same base station
class, they ensure that both co-located systems can operate with minimal
degradation to each other.

Unwanted emission and out of band blocking co-location requirements are
optional requirements based on declaration. TX OFF and TX IMD are
mandatory requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as
it represents the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.

NOTE: Due to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious
emissions and TX OFF level co-location is the most suitable method to
show conformance.

The *co-location reference antenna* shall be a single column passive
antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency
range, polarization, as the composite antenna of the *BS type 1-O* and
nominal 65° horizontal half-power *beamwidth* (suitable for 3-sector
deployment) and is placed at a distance *d* from the edge of the *BS
type 1-O*, as shown in figure 4.9-1.

![](./media/image8.emf){width="6.677083333333333in"
height="4.041666666666667in"}

Figure 4.9-1: Illustration of *BS type 1-O* enclosure and *co-location
reference antenna*

Edge-to-edge separation *d* between the *BS type 1-O* and the
*co-location reference antenna* shall be set to 0.1 m.

The *BS type 1-O* and the *co-location reference antenna* shall be
aligned in a common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight
direction, as shown in figure 4.9-1.

The *co-location reference antenna* and the *BS type 1-O* can have
different width.

The vertical radiating regions of the *co-location reference antenna*
and the *BS type 1-O* composite antenna shall be aligned.

For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at
the *co-location reference antenna* is different from the *BS type 1-O*,
a *co-location reference antenna* suitable for the frequency stated in
the requirement is assumed.

OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted
interface of a *co-location reference antenna*, depending on the
requirement this interface is either an input or an output. For *BS type
1-O* with dual polarization *the co-location reference antenna* has two
conducted interfaces each representing one polarization.

 5 *Operating bands* and channel arrangement
===========================================

5.1 General
-----------

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the
*operating bands* and *BS channel bandwidths* defined in the present
release of specifications.

NOTE: Other *operating bands* and *BS channel bandwidth*s may be
considered in future releases.

Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in
which NR can operate according to the present version of the
specification are identified as described in table 5.1-1.

Table 5.1-1: Definition of frequency ranges

The *BS channel bandwidth* supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink
or downlink at the Base Station. Different *UE channel bandwidths* may
be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving
from UEs connected to the BS. The placement of the *UE channel
bandwidth* is flexible but can only be completely within the *BS channel
bandwidth*. The BS shall be able to transmit to and/or receive from one
or more UE bandwidth parts that are smaller than or equal to the number
of carrier resource blocks on the RF carrier, in any part of the carrier
resource blocks.

The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guardband and the
*transmission bandwidth configuration* is shown in figure 5.3.1-1.

.

bandwidth configuration* for one NR channel

### 5.3.2 *Transmission bandwidth configuration*

The *transmission bandwidth configuration* N~RB~ for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and subcarrier spacing is specified in table 5.3.2.-1 for FR1
and table 5.3.2-2 for FR2.

The minimum guardband of SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block for each *BS channel
bandwidth* is specified in table 5.3.3-3 for FR2.

NOTE: The minimum guardband in Table 5.3.3-3 is applicable only when the
SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block is placed adjacent to the edge of the *BS
channel bandwidth* within which the SS/PBCH block is located.

The number of RBs configured in any *BS channel bandwidth* shall ensure
that the minimum guardband specified in this clause is met.

Figure 5.3.3-1: BS PRB utilization

In the case that multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same
symbol, the minimum guardband on each side of the carrier is the
guardband applied at the configured *BS channel bandwidth* for the
numerology that is transmitted/received immediately adjacent to the
guard band.

For FR1, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and
the *BS channel bandwidth* is \>50 MHz, the guardband applied adjacent
to 15 kHz SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 30 kHz SCS
for the same *BS channel bandwidth*.

For FR2, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and
the *BS channel bandwidth* is \>200 MHz, the guardband applied adjacent
to 60 kHz SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 120 kHz SCS
for the same *BS channel bandwidth*.

### 5.3.4 RB alignment

For each *BS channel bandwidth* and each numerology, *BS transmission
bandwidth configuration* must fulfil the minimum guardband requirement
specified in clause 5.3.3.

For each numerology, its common resource blocks are specified in clause
4.4.4.3 in \[9\], and the starting point of its *transmission bandwidth
configuration* on the common resource block grid for a given channel
bandwidth is indicated by an offset to "Reference point A" in the unit
of the numerology.

For each numerology, all *UE transmission bandwidth configurations*
indicated to UEs served by the BS by higher layer parameter
*carrierBandwidth* defined in TS 38.331 \[11\] shall fall within the *BS
transmission bandwidth configuration*.

5.3.5 BS channel bandwidth per operating band

The requirements in this specification apply to the combination of *BS
channel bandwidths*, SCS and *operating bands* shown in table 5.3.5-1
for FR1 and in table 5.3.5-2 for FR2. The *transmission bandwidth
configuration* in table 5.3.2-1 and table 5.3.2-2 shall be supported for
each of the *BS channel bandwidths* within the BS capability. The *BS
channel bandwidths* are specified for both the Tx and Rx path.

5.3A *BS channel bandwidth* for CA
----------------------------------

### 5.3A.1 *Transmission bandwidth configuration* for CA

For *carrier aggregation*, the *transmission bandwidth configuration* is
defined per component carrier and the requirement is specified in clause
5.3.2.

### 5.3A.2 Minimum guardband and *transmission bandwidth configuration* for CA

For intra-band contiguous *carrier aggregation*, *Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth* and *Guard Bands* are defined as follows, see Figure
5.3A.2-1.

Figure 5.3A.2-1: Definition of *Aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth* for
intra-band *carrier aggregation*

The *aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth*, **BW~Channel\_CA,~** is defined
as

BW~Channel\_CA~ = F~edge,high~ - F~edge,low~ (MHz)

The lower bandwidth edge F~edge,\ low~ and the upper bandwidth edge
F~edge,high~ of the aggregated *BS channel bandwidth* are used as
frequency reference points for transmitter and receiver requirements and
are defined by

F~edge,low~ = F~C,low~ - F~offset,low~

F~edge,high~ = F~C,high~ + F~offset,high~

The lower and upper frequency offsets depend on the *transmission
bandwidth configuration*s of the lowest and highest assigned edge
component carrier and are defined as

F~offset,low~ = (N~RB,low~\*12 + 1)\*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB,low~ (MHz)

F~offset,high~ = (N~RB,high~\*12 - 1)\*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB,high~ (MHz)

N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the *transmission bandwidth configuration*s
according to Table 5.3.2-1 or Table 5.3.2-2 for the lowest and highest
assigned component carrier, SCS~low~ and SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier
spacing for the lowest and highest assigned component carrier
respectively. SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and
BW~GB,high~ use the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing
configurations supported in the operating band for both of the channel
bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~ are
the minimum guard band for lowest and highest assigned component carrier
according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said *μ* value. In case there is no
common μ value for both of the channel bandwidths, *μ*=1 is used for
SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~.

For intra-band non-contiguous *carrier aggregation* *sub-block
bandwidth* and *sub-block edges* are defined as follows, see figure
5.3A.2-2.

Figure 5.3A.2-2: Definition of *sub-block bandwidth* for intra-band
*non-contiguous spectrum*

The *lower sub-block edge* of the *sub-block bandwidth*
(BW~Channel,block~) is defined as follows:

F~edge,block,\ low~ = F~C,block,low~ - F~offset,low~

The *upper sub-block edge* of the *sub-block bandwidth* is defined as
follows:

F~edge,block,high~ = F~C,block,high~ + F~offset,high~

The *sub-block bandwidth*, BW~Channel,block~, is defined as follows:

BW~Channel,block~ = F~edge,block,high\ -~ F~edge,block,low~ (MHz)

The lower and upper frequency offsets F~offset,block,low~ and
F~offset,block,high~ depend on the *transmission bandwidth
configuration*s of the lowest and highest assigned edge component
carriers within a *sub-block* and are defined as

F~offset,block,low~ = (N~RB,low~\*12 + 1)\*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB,low~ (MHz)

F~offset,block,high~ = (N~RB,high~\*12 - 1)\*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB,high~
(MHz)

where N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the transmission bandwidth
configurations according to Table 5.3.2-1 or Table 5.3.2-2 for the
lowest and highest assigned component carrier within a *sub-block*,
respectively. SCS~low~ and SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier spacing for the
lowest and highest assigned component carrier within a *sub-block*,
respectively. SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and
BW~GB,high~ use the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing
configurations supported in the operating band for both of the channel
bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~ are
the minimum guard band for lowest and highest assigned component carrier
according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said *μ* value. In case there is no
common μ value for both of the channel bandwidths, *μ*=1 is used for
SCS~low~, SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, BW~GB,low~ and BW~GB,high~.

The *sub-block gap size* between two consecutive *sub-blocks* W~gap~ is
defined as follows:

W~gap~ = F~edge,block\ n+1,low~ - F~edge,block\ n,high~ (MHz)

5.4 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 5.4.1 Channel spacing

#### 5.4.1.1 Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the *BS channel bandwidths*.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined
as following:

\- For NR FR1 *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster,

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

\- For NR FR1 *operating bands* with 15 kHz channel raster,

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-5
kHz, 0 kHz, 5 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-10
kHz, 0 kHz, 10 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz

\- For NR FR2 *operating bands* with 60 kHz channel raster,

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-20
kHz, 0 kHz, 20 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 60 kHz

▪ Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-40
kHz, 0 kHz, 40 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 120 kHz

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *BS channel bandwidths*
of the two respective NR carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.

#### 5.4.1.2 Channel spacing for CA

For intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers, the channel spacing
between adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of least common
multiple of channel raster and sub-carrier spacing.

The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated NR carriers
is defined as follows:

For NR *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster:

$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)} - GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.6} \right\rfloor 0.3\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz})$

For NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz channel raster:

$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)} - GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.015*2^{n + 1}} \right\rfloor 0.015*2^{n}\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz})$

with

$\ n = \mu_{0}$

For NR *operating bands* with 60kHz channel raster:

$\text{Nominal}\mspace{6mu}\text{channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor \frac{BW_{Channel(1)} + BW_{Channel(2)} - 2\left| GB_{Channel(1)} - GB_{Channel(2)} \right|}{0.06*2^{n + 1}} \right\rfloor 0.06*2^{n}\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz})$

with

$\ n = \mu_{0} - 2$

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *BS channel bandwidths*
of the two respective NR component carriers according to Table 5.3.2-1
and 5.3.2-2 with values in MHz, $\mu_{0}\ $the largest $\mu$ value among
the subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the *operating band*
for both of the channel bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and Table
5.3.5-2 and *GB~Channel(i)~* the minimum guard band for channel
bandwidth *i* according to Table 5.3.3-1 and Table 5.3.3-2 for the said
$\mu$ value, with $\mu$ as defined in TS 38.211 \[9\]. In case there is
no common μ value for both of the channel bandwidths, μ~0~=1 is selected
for NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz channel raster and *GB~Channel(i)~*
is the minimum guard band for channel bandwidth i according to Table
5.3.3-1 for *μ=1* with *μ* as defined in TS 38.211\[9\].

The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous *carrier aggregation* can
be adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel raster
and sub-carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.

For intra-band non-contiguous *carrier aggregation*, the channel spacing
between two NR component carriers in different *sub-blocks* shall be
larger than the nominal channel spacing defined in this clause.

### 5.4.2 Channel raster

#### 5.4.2.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster

The global frequency raster defines a set of *RF reference frequencies*
F~REF~. The *RF reference frequency* is used in signalling to identify
the position of RF channels, SS blocks and other elements. The global
frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz. The
granularity of the global frequency raster is ΔF~Global~.

*RF reference frequencies* are designated by an NR Absolute Radio
Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) in the range \[0...3279165\] on the
global frequency raster. The relation between the NR-ARFCN and the *RF
reference frequency* F~REF~ in MHz is given by the following equation,
where F~REF-Offs~ and N~Ref-Offs~ are given in table 5.4.2.1-1 and
N~REF~ is the NR-ARFCN.

F~REF~ = F~REF-Offs~ + ΔF~Global~ (N~REF~ -- N~REF-Offs~)

Table 5.4.2.1-1: NR-ARFCN parameters for the global frequency raster

  Range of frequencies(MHz)   ΔF~Global~ (kHz)   F~REF-Offs~ (MHz)   N~REF-Offs~   Range of N~REF~
  --------------------------- ------------------ ------------------- ------------- --------------------
  0 -- 3000                   5                  0                   0             0 -- 599999
  3000 -- 24250               15                 3000                600000        600000 -- 2016666
  24250 -- 100000             60                 24250.08            2016667       2016667 -- 3279165

The *channel raster* defines a subset of *RF reference frequencies* that
can be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and
downlink. The *RF reference frequency* for an RF channel maps to a
resource element on the carrier. For each *operating band*, a subset of
frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that
band and forms a channel raster with a granularity ΔF~Raster~, which may
be equal to or larger than ΔF~Global~.

For SUL bands, for the uplink of all FDD bands defined in table 5.2-1
and for band n34, n38 and n39,

F~REF,shift~ = F~REF~ + Δ~shift~, where Δ~shift~ = 0 kHz or 7.5 kHz

where Δ~shift~ is signalled by the network in higher layer parameter
*frequencyShift7p5khz* as defined in TS 38.331 \[11\].

For band n34, n38 and n39, F~REF,\ shift~ is only applicable to uplink
transmissions using a 15 kHz SCS.

The mapping between the *channel raster* and corresponding resource
element is given in clause 5.4.2.2. The applicable entries for each
*operating band* are defined in clause 5.4.2.3.

#### 5.4.2.2 Channel raster to resource element mapping

The mapping between the *RF reference frequency* on the channel raster
and the corresponding resource element is given in table 5.4.2.2-1 and
can be used to identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on
the total number of RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to
both UL and DL. The mapping must apply to at least one numerology
supported by the BS.

Table 5.4.2.2-1: Channel Raster to Resource Element Mapping

                                   $$N_{\text{RB}}\text{mod}2 = 0$$   $$N_{\text{RB}}\text{mod}2 = 1$$
  -------------------------------- ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  Resource element index           0                                  6
  Physical resource block number                                      

*k*, and N~RB~ are as defined in TS 38.211 \[9\].

#### 5.4.2.3 Channel raster entries for each *operating band*

The RF channel positions on the channel raster in each NR *operating
band* are given through the applicable NR-ARFCN in table 5.4.2.3-1 for
FR1 and table 5.4.2.3-2 for FR2, using the channel raster to resource
element mapping in clause 5.4.2.2.

\- For NR *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster, ΔF~Raster~ = 20
× ΔF~Global~. In this case, every 20^th^ NR-ARFCN within the *operating
band* are applicable for the channel raster within the *operating band*
and the step size for the channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as
\<20\>.

\- For NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz channel raster below 3 GHz,
ΔF~Raster~ = *I* × ΔF~Global~, where *I* ϵ {3,6}. In this case, every
*I^th^* NR‑ARFCN within the *operating band* are applicable for the
channel raster within the *operating band* and the step size for the
channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as \<*I*\>.

\- For NR *operating bands* with 15 kHz and 60 kHz channel raster above
3 GHz, ΔF~Raster~ = *I* ×ΔF~Global~, where *I* ϵ {1, 2}. In this case,
every *I^th^* NR‑ARFCN within the *operating band* are applicable for
the channel raster within the *operating band* and the step size for the
channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 and table 5.4.2.3-2 is given as
\<*I*\>.

\- For frequency bands with two ΔF~Raster~ in FR1, the higher ΔF~Raster~
applies to channels using only the SCS that is equal to or larger than
the higher ΔF~Raster~ and SSB SCS is equal to the higher ΔF~Raster~.

\- For frequency bands with two ΔF~Raster~ in FR2, the higher ΔF~Raster~
applies to channels using only the SCS that is equal to the higher
ΔF~Raster~ and the SSB SCS that is equal to or larger than the higher
ΔF~Raster~.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster

#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering

The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition
when explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not
present.

A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The
frequency position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with
corresponding number GSCN. The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN
for all the frequency ranges are in table 5.4.3.1-1.

The resource element corresponding to the SS block reference frequency
SS~REF~ is given in clause 5.4.3.2. The synchronization raster and the
subcarrier spacing of the synchronization block is defined separately
for each band.

 6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
=======================================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB
connector* for *BS type 1-H*, with a full complement of transceiver
units for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

*For BS type 1-H the manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of
supported geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas c*overed by
*beams). The minimum number of supported geographical cells (N~cells~)
relates to the BS setting with the minimum amount of cell splitting
supported with transmission on all TAB connectors supporting the
operating band,* or with minimum amount of transmitted *beams.*

*For BS type 1-H manufacturer shall also declare TAB connector TX min
cell groups.* Every *TAB connector* of the *BS type 1-H* supporting
transmission in an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector* *TX
min cell group* supporting the same *operating band*, where *mapping of
TAB connectors to cells/beams is implementation dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the conducted TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for BS
type 1-H is calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~ , 8×N~cells~)*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~*

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
-------------------------

### 6.4.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.4.1.1 General

Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of NR BS.

Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the *transmission
bandwidth configuration* of the BS (BW~Config~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF period*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

For *multi-band connectors* and for *single band connectors* supporting
transmission in multiple *operating bands*, the requirement is only
applicable during the *transmitter OFF period* in all supported
*operating bands*.

For BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power is
defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the *Aggregated BS Channel Bandwidth*
**BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge,high~+F~edge,low~)/2 during the
*transmitter OFF period*.** N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the *Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth*.

#### 6.4.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C*

For *BS type 1-C*, the requirements for transmitter OFF power spectral
density shall be less than -85 dBm/MHz per *antenna connector*.

#### 6.4.1.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-H*, the requirements for transmitter OFF power spectral
density shall be less than -85 dBm/MHz per *TAB connector*.

### 6.4.2 *Transmitter transient period*

#### 6.4.2.1 General

*Transmitter transient period* requirements apply only to TDD operation
of NR BS.

The *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the *transmitter OFF period* to the
*transmitter ON period* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient
period* is illustrated in figure 6.4.2.1-1.

Figure 6.4.2.1-1: Example of relations between *transmitter ON period*,
*transmitter OFF period* and *transmitter transient period*

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB

6.5 Transmitted signal quality
------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Frequency error

#### 6.5.1.1 General

The requirements in clause 6.5.1 apply to the *transmitter ON period*.

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type* 1-H, the modulated carrier frequency of
each NR carrier configured by the BS shall be accurate to within the
accuracy range given in table 6.5.1.2-1 observed over 1 ms.

  ----------------- -----------
  BS class          Accuracy
  Wide Area BS      ±0.05 ppm
  Medium Range BS   ±0.1 ppm
  Local Area BS     ±0.1 ppm
  ----------------- -----------

### 6.5.2 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.2.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector. Details about how the EVM is determined are specified in Annex
B.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-C* and *1-H*, the EVM levels of each NR carrier for
different modulation schemes on PDSCH outlined in table 6.5.2.2-1 shall
be met using the frame structure described in clause 6.5.2.3.

  64QAM                         8 %
  256QAM                        3.5 %

#### 6.5.2.3 EVM frame structure for measurement

EVM shall be evaluated for each NR carrier over all allocated resource
blocks and downlink subframes. Different modulation schemes listed in
table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

For NR, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for
each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink
subframes within 10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM
measurement periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

### 6.5.3 Time alignment error

#### 6.5.3.1 General

This requirement shall apply to frame timing in MIMO transmission,
*carrier aggregation* and their combinations.

Frames of the NR signals present at the BS transmitter *antenna
connectors* or *TAB connectors* are not perfectly aligned in time. The
RF signals present at the BS transmitter *antenna connectors* or
*transceiver array boundary* may experience certain timing differences
in relation to each other.

The TAE is specified for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-C*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to different *antenna connectors* for
a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.

For *BS type 1-H*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to *TAB connectors* belonging to
different transmitter groups at the *transceiver array boundary*, where
transmitter groups are associated with the *TAB connectors* in the
transceiver unit array corresponding to MIMO transmission, *carrier
aggregation* for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type* 1-H

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, TAE shall not exceed
65 ns.

For intra-band contiguous *carrier aggregation*, with or without MIMO,
TAE shall not exceed 260ns.

For intra-band non-contiguous *carrier aggregation*, with or without
MIMO, TAE shall not exceed 3µs.

For inter-band *carrier aggregation*, with or without MIMO, TAE shall
not exceed 3µs.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[2\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *BS
channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The *Operating band* unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~
below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

Table 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  BS type         *Operating band* characteristics               Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  --------------- ---------------------------------------------- ----------------
  *BS type 1-H*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz             10
                  100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz    40
  *BS type 1-C*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 200 MHz              10
                  200 MHz \< F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

For *BS type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied per the
*TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the configurations supported
by the BS. The *basic limits* and corresponding emissions scaling are
defined in each relevant clause.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[3\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

For *BS type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the *antenna
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* this requirement shall be appliedat each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the *BS
channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he occupied
bandwidth shall be less than or equal the *Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth*.**

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.6.3.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth* whatever the type of transmitter considered (single
carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.2-2a, while the CACLR requirement in clause
6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency ranges defined
in table 6.6.3.2-3.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2
shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.2-2a, while the CACLR requirement in clause
6.6.3.2 shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-3.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON period*.

#### 6.6.3.2 Limits and *Basic limits*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
*transmission bandwidth configuration* of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the ACLR shall be higher
than the value specified in table 6.6.3.2‑1.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
*sub-block* gap or the *Inter RF Bandwidth* *gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap* or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.6.3.2-3 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.6.3.2-4.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for NR carriers located on either side of the *sub-block* gap or the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.6.3.2-3.

#### 6.6.3.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2, 6.6.3.2-3a
or the ACLR (CACLR) *limits* in table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-2a or
6.6.3.2-3, whichever is less stringent, shall apply for each *antenna
connector*.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be applied
to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna connectors* for
*BS type 1-C*.

#### 6.6.3.4 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2 + X,
6.6.3.2-3a + X (where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~)) or the ACLR
(CACLR) *limits* in table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-2a or 6.6.3.2-3, whichever
is less stringent, shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group*.

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* ACLR requirement can be
demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The ratio of the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the assigned
channel frequency to the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent
channel frequency shall be greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic
limit* of the BS. This shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group*.

Or

2\) The ratio of the filtered mean power at the *TAB connector* centred
on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power at this
*TAB connector* centred on the adjacent channel frequency shall be
greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic limit* of the BS for every *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each *TAB
connector TX min cell group*.

In case the ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of *BS type 1-H* are
applied, the conformance can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of
the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the filtered mean power measured on each *TAB connector*
in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent channel
frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR (CACLR) absolute
ba*sic limit* + X of the BS. This shall apply to each *TAB* connector
*TX min cell group.*

Or

2\) The filtered mean power at each *TAB connector* centred on the
adjacent channel frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR
(CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of the BS scaled by X -10log~10~(*n*) for
every *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each
*TAB connector TX min cell group*, where *n* is the number of *TAB
connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group.*

### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions 

#### 6.6.4.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of
each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑1 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for a BS operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *sub-block gap*. In
addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

*Basic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is
specified in clauses 6.6.4.2.1 to 6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported *operating band* without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in
another supported *operating band*. In this case, no cumulative *basic
limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink
*operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink
*operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits* of the band where
there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present
clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits*
of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the
tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~),
shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band connector* or a *single-band connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous *carrier
aggregation* the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the *lowest carrier* frequency and the upper edge
of the carrier transmitted at the *highest carrier* frequency within a
specified frequency band.

In addition inside any *sub-block gap* for a *single-band connector*
operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined *basic* limit shall
be applied which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified
for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the *sub-block gap*. The
*basic limit* for each *sub-block* is specified in clauses 6.6.4.2.1 to
6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Wide Area BS, the requirements of either clause 6.6.4.2.1 (Category
A limits) or clause 6.6.4.2.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.

For Medium Range BS, the requirements in clause 6.6.4.2.3 shall apply
(Category A and B).

For Local Area BS, the requirements of clause 6.6.4.2.4 shall apply
(Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B *basic limits* shall
be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.6.5.

#### 6.6.4.2 *Basic limits*

##### 6.6.4.2.1 *Basic limits* for Wide Area BS (Category A)

For BS operating in Bands n5, n8, n12, n28, n71, *basic limits* are
specified in table 6.6.4.2.1‑1.

##### 6.6.4.2.2 *Basic limits* for Wide Area BS (Category B)

For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options
for the *basic limits* that may be applied regionally. Either the *basic
limits* in clause 6.6.4.2.2.1 or clause 6.6.4.2.2.2 shall be applied.

###### 6.6.4.2.2.1 Category B requirements (Option 1)

For BS operating in Bands n5, n8, n12, n20, n28, n71, the *basic limits*
are specified in table 6.6.4.2.2.1-1:

##### 6.6.4.2.5 *Basic limits* for additional requirements

###### 6.6.4.2.5.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.4.2.1, 6.6.4.2.2,
6.6.4.2.3 and 6.6.4.2.4, the BS may have to comply with the applicable
emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[8\], when deployed in
regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions
declared by the manufacturer.

###### 6.6.4.2.5.2 Protection of DTT

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *BS type 1-C* or *BS type 1-H* operating in Band n20, the level
of emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter
bandwidth on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table
6.6.4.2.5.2-1, a *basic limits* P~EM,N~ is declared by the manufacturer.
This requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though
part of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Table 6.6.4.2.5.2-1: Declared emissions *basic limit* for protection of
DTT

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Filter centre frequency, F~filter~   *Measurement bandwidth*   Declared emission *basic limit* (dBm)
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------- ---------------------------------------
  F~filter~ = 8\*N + 306 (MHz);\       8 MHz                     P~EM,N~
  21 ≤ N ≤ 60                                                    

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain
and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the BS needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined
using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[13\], annex F.

#### 6.6.4.3 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C*

The operating band unwanted emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each
*antenna connector* shall be below the applicable *basic limits* defined
in clause 6.6.4.2.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted emissions
limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over all
*antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C.*

#### 6.6.4.4 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-H*

The operating band unwanted emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are
that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable
*basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2, the power summation emissions at the
*TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not
exceed a BS limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 General

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*,
where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1. For some *operating
bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with
the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating band*, as specified
in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[2\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 6.6.5.2 *Basic limits*

##### 6.6.5.2.1 General transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *basic limits* of either table 6.6.5.2.1-1 (Category A limits) or
table 6.6.5. 2.1-2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.4.

##### 6.6.5.2.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of the BSs being desensitised by emissions from a
BS transmitter. It is measured at the transmit *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* or at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H* for any type
of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx *antenna* *connectors* / *TAB
connectors*.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.2.2-1.

Table 6.6.5.2.2-1: BS spurious emissions *basic limits* for protection
of the BS receiver

  Wide Area BS      F~UL,low~ -- F~UL,high~   -96 dBm          100 kHz                   
  Medium Range BS   F~UL,low~ -- F~UL,high~   -91 dBm          100 kHz                   
  Local Area BS     F~UL,low~ -- F~UL,high~   -88 dBm          100 kHz                   

##### 6.6.5.2.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink *operating band*. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.2.3 -1
for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in
the first column apply. For a *multi-band connector*, the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.2.3 -1 apply for each
supported *operating band*.

co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3
-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the
downlink *operating band* (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this
excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.3 -1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent *operating bands* can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may
apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For NR Band n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band
27 UL *operating band*.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.6.1.

The spurious emission *basic limit* for this requirement is:

Table 6.6.5.2.3-2: BS spurious emissions *basic limits* for BS for
co-existence with PHS

Table 6.6.5.2.3-3: Void

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR BS
operating in Band n50 and n75 within the 1432 -- 1452 MHz, and in Band
n51 and Band n76. The *basic limit is* specified in Table 6.6.5.2.3-4.
This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the BS downlink *operating
band*.

Table 6.6.5.2.3-4: Additional operating band unwanted emission *basic

  F~filter~ = 1413.5 MHz               -42 dBm         27 MHz

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to BS operating
in NR Band n50 and n75 within 1492-1517 MHz and in Band n74 within
1492-1518 MHz. The maximum level of emissions, measured on centre
frequencies F~filter~ with filter bandwidth according to Table
6.6.5.2.3-5, shall be defined according to the *basic limits*
P~EM,n50/n75,a~ nor P~EM,n50/n75,b~ declared by the manufacturer.

Table 6.6.5.2.3-5: *Operating band* n50, n74 and n75 declared emission

  1520.5 MHz ≤ F~filter~ ≤ 1558.5 MHz   P~EM,n50/n75,b~                 1 MHz

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[12\], is defined in terms
of EIRP, which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the *antenna
connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss).
The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base
station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. The
assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.

The following requirement may apply to BS for Band n41 operation in
Japan. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up
to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating
band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

Table 6.6.5.2.3-6: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band n41

  Frequency range                                                               *Basic limit*   *Measurement Bandwidth*

  NOTE: This requirement applies for carriers allocated within 2545-2645 MHz.                   

##### 6.6.5.2.4 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class.

The *basic limits* are in table 6.6.5.2.4-1 for a BS where requirements
for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared Base Station class. For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.5.2.4-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.4-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the BS transmit
frequency range of a downlink *operating band* (see table 5.2-1). The
current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for
30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 \[4\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.4-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in
the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply
that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent *operating band* can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

#### 6.6.5.3 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C*

The Tx spurious emissions for *BS type 1-C* for each *antenna connector*
shall not exceed the *basic limits* specified in clause 6.6.5.2.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious emissions over
all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C* shall not exceed the *basic
limits* defined in clause 6.6.5.2.

#### 6.6.5.4 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-H*

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic limit*
in clause 6.6.5.2, the power summation emissions at the *TAB connectors*
of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not exceed a limit
specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *BS type 1-H* spurious emission requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *BS type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.7.1 General

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the antenna, RDN
and antenna array. The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* and the *transmitter transient period*.

For *BS type 1-C*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *antenna connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *TAB connector*.

For *BS type 1-H*, there are two types of transmitter intermodulation
cases captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the *BS type 1-H*.

For *BS type 1-H*, the co-location transmitter intermodulation
requirement is considered sufficient if the interference signal for the
co-location requirement is higher than the declared interference signal
for intra-system transmitter intermodulation requirement.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C*

#### 6.7.2.1 Co-location minimum requirements

For *BS type 1-C*, the wanted signal and interfering signal centre
frequency is specified in table 6.7.2.1‑1, where interfering signal
level is *Rated total output power* (P~rated,t,AC~) at *antenna
connector* in the *operating band* -- 30 dB.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirement is also
applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the *sub-block gap*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For a *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges of each supported *operating
band*. In case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is less than 3\*BW~Channel~
(where BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS channel bandwidth* of the band),
the requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering signal
offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap*.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 6.6.3, 6.6.4 and 6.6.5 in the presence of an
NR interfering signal according to table 6.7.2.1-1.

the *inter RF Bandwidth gap* is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ (where
BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS channel bandwidth* of the band), the
requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering signal offsets
where the interfering signal falls completely within the *inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at the *antenna
connector* for *BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the configuration in
normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements apply during the BS receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the transmitter
unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a
*sub-block gap*.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level
-------------------------------

### 7.2.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB
connector* for *BS type 1-H* at which a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 7.2.2-2 for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.2.2-3 for Local Area BS.

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

### 7.3.1 General

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector*
for *BS type 1-H* inside the received *BS channel bandwidth*. In this
condition, a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified
reference measurement channel. The interfering signal for the dynamic
range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-1 for Wide Area BS, in table 7.3.2-2 for Medium Range BS
and in table 7.3.2-3 for Local Area BS.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver's
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified
centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a
victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *BS* *type
1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* are specified
in table 7.4.1.2-1 and the frequency offset between the wanted and
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2 for ACS. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in table 7.2.2-1, 7.2.2-2
and 7.2.2-3 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base station RF Bandwidth* edges or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside any *sub-block
gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as the NR
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACS requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
table 7.4.1.2‑2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.4.2.1 General

The in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver's
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer, which is an NR signal
for general blocking or an NR signal with one resource block for
narrowband blocking.

#### 7.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1‑H* *TAB connector* using
the parameters in tables 7.4.2.2-1, 7.4.2.2-2 and 7.4.2.2-3 for general
blocking and narrowband blocking requirements. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.2 for each *BS
channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
D.

The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

The in-band blocking requirement shall apply from F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
*operating band*. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is
defined in table 7.4.2.2-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

Table 7.4.2.2-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands*

  BS type         *Operating band* characteristics               Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  --------------- ---------------------------------------------- ---------------
  *BS type 1-C*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 200 MHz              20
                  200 MHz \< F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60
  *BS type 1-H*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 100 MHz             20
                  100 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz    60

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the in-band blocking requirements apply in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 7.4.2.2-1. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the blocking requirements apply in the
in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating band*.
The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 7.4.2.2-1.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall apply in addition
inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least
as wide as the *channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal in Table
7.4.2.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering
signal in Table 7.4.2.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking
------------------------

### 7.5.1 General

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer out of the *operating
band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* using
the parameters in table 7.5.2-1. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.2 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to F~UL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz, including the
downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band* for BS supporting
FDD. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is defined in table
7.4.2.2-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

For a *multi-band connector*, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each *operating band*, with the
exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported
*operating bands* according to clause 7.4.2.2 shall be excluded from the
out-of-band blocking requirement.

### 7.5.3 Co-location minimum requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of NR BS receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA or NR BS operating in a
different frequency band are co-located with a NR BS. The requirement is
applicable to all *BS channel bandwidths* supported by the NR BS.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and NR BS receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*BS type 1-C* *antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector* input
using the parameters in table 7.5.3-1 for all the BS classes. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
tables 7.2.2-1, 7.2.2-2 and 7.2.2-3 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and
further specified in annex A.1.

The blocking requirement for co-location with BS in other bands is
applied for all *operating bands* for which co-location protection is
provided.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *antenna connector* for
*BS type 1-C* and at the *TAB connector* for *BS type 1-H.*

co-located with BS in other frequency bands.

### 7.5.4 Void

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector* (for *BS type 1-C*) or at the *TAB connector* (for *BS type
1-H*). The requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX *antenna
connectors* / *TAB connectors*.

NOTE: In this case for FDD operation the test is performed when both TX
and RX are ON, with the TX *antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors*
terminated.

For a*ntenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
TDD, the requirements apply during the *transmitter OFF period*. For
*antenna connectors* / *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in
FDD, the RX spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX
spurious emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.6.5.

For RX-only *multi-band* *connectors*, the spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*. For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF period*, and are subject to exclusion
zones in each supported *operating band*.

For *BS type 1-H* manufacturer shall declare *TAB connector RX min cell
groups*. Every *TAB connector* of *BS type 1‑H* supporting reception in
an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
where mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells/*beams* is implementation
dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for *BS type
1-H* is calculated as follows:

N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active~ , 8* *× N~cells~)*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~, where
N~cells~ is defined in clause 6.1.*

NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units and
is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

The receiver spurious emissions *basic limits* are provided in table
7.6.2-1.

### 7.6.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C*

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-C* are that for
each *antenna connector,* the power of emissions shall not exceed *basic
limits* specified in table 7.6.2-1.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, the sum of RX spurious emissions
requirements over all *antenna connectors* for *BS type 1-C* shall not
exceed *basic limits* specified in table 7.6.2-1.

### 7.6.4 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H*

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-H* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.2-1 for each *TAB
connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at respective
*TAB connectors* shall not exceed the BS limits specified as the *basic
limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated
differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the BS.*

NOTE: Conformance to the BS receiver spurious emissions requirement can
be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the BS limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the BS limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

### 7.7.1 General

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency at
the *antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS
type 1-H* in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the *BS type 1-C
antenna connector* or *BS type 1-H* *TAB connector*, with the conditions
specified in tables 7.7.2-1 and 7.7.2-2 for intermodulation performance
and in tables 7.7.2-3, and 7.7.2-4 for narrowband intermodulation
performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in tables 7.2.2-1, 7.2.2-2 and 7.2.2-3 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall in
general be the same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal,
except for the case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and *BS
channel bandwidth* \<=20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the
interfering signal shall be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a BS operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at
least as wide as the *channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal in
table 7.7.2-2 or 7.7.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the intermodulation requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap
size is at least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre
frequency offset from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement
shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in case the
gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in tables
7.7.2-2 and 7.7.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*.

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at the
*antenna connector* for *BS type 1-C* or *TAB connector* for *BS type
1-H* in the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering
signal shall be an NR signal which is time aligned with the wanted
signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type* *1-H*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in annex A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.8.2-1 for Wide Area
BS, in table 7.8.2-2 for Medium Range BS and in table 7.8.2-3 for Local
Area BS. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

 8 Conducted performance requirements
====================================

8.1 General
-----------

### 8.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-C* or *BS type 1-H* to correctly demodulate signals in various
conditions and configurations. Conducted performance requirements are
specified at the *antenna connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-C*) and at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *BS type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the BS are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation
conditions in annex G. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the base station.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting *carrier
aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *antenna connectors* (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in the *operating* *band*
turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions, *antenna connector*s (for *BS type
1-C*) or *TAB connectors* (for *BS type 1-H*) in FDD operation are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The associated
transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the tests as specified in TS
38.141-1 \[5\].

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single *antenna connector*
(for *BS type 1-C*) or on a single *TAB connector* (for *BS type 1-H*).

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the same duration where signal energy exists on a single
*antenna connector* (for *BS type 1-C*) or on a single *TAB connector*
(for *BS type 1-H*).

8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 8.2.2.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.3 Requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

#### 8.2.3.1 General

In the tests for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, and there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The CSI part 1 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the CSI part 1 information when the
CSI part 1 information is sent as follow:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 1)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 1 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1 information
transmitted occasions.

The CSI part 2 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2
information is sent as follows:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 2)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 2 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information
transmitted occasions.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0 c1 c2 c3 c4\]
= \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the
RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\] for CSI part2
information.

The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 DTX to ACK probability

#### 8.3.1.1 General

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing was sent:

$\text{Prob}\left( PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits \right) = \ \frac{\#(\text{false}\ \text{ACK}\ \text{bits})}{\#\left( \text{PUCCH\ DTX} \right)*\#(\text{ACK}/\text{NACK}\ \text{bits})}$

where:

\- \#(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.

\- \#(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per slot

\- \#(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability shall not exceed 1% for all PUCCH formats
carrying ACK/NACK bits:

$\text{Prob}\left( PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits \right)\  \leq \ 10^{- 2}$

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.2.1 General

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK was sent.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

#### 8.3.2.2 Minimum requirements

The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR
given in table 8.3.2.2-1 and in table 8.3.2.2-2.

### 8.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.3.3.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./media/image24.wmf){width="4.170138888888889in"
height="0.38680555555555557in"},

where:

\- ![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.1791666666666667in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./media/image26.wmf){width="2.047222222222222in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded as
ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

### 8.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

#### 8.3.5.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

##### 8.3.7.2.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.3.7.2.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./media/image24.wmf){width="4.170138888888889in"
height="0.38680555555555557in"},

where:

\- ![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.1791666666666667in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./media/image26.wmf){width="2.047222222222222in"
height="0.2076388888888889in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded as
ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
--------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability

#### 8.4.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements

#### 8.4.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN and TDLC300-100, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the
strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance given in Table
8.4.2.1-1.

  ------------------------ ----------------- ---------------------- -------------

The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1 and the
test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

#### 8.4.2.2 Minimum requirements

The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in Tables 8.4.2.2-1 to 8.4.2.2-3.

 9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

9.1 General
-----------

Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the *BS type
1-H*, *BS type 1-O*, or *BS type 2-O* including all its functional
components active and for all foreseen modes of operation of the BS
unless otherwise stated.

9.2 Radiated transmit power
---------------------------

### 9.2.1 General

*BS type 1-H, BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* are declared to support one
or more *beams*, as per manufacturer's declarations specified in TS
38.141-2 \[6\]. Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for
a declared *beam* at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each *beam*, the requirement is based on declaration of a *beam*
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, *beamwidth*, *rated beam
EIRP*, *OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the
maximum steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
*beamwidth(s)*.

For a declared *beam* and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate
at the associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter ON
period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *operating bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW)
is larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by
manufacturer:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier
EIRP is:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O*

For each declared *beam*, in normal conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within ±2.2
dB of the claimed value.

For *BS type 1-O* only, for each declared *beam*, in extreme conditions,
for any specific *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction
pair* within the *OTA peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP
level in the corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to
within ±2.7 dB of the claimed value.

Normal and extreme conditions are defined in TS 38.141-2, annex B \[6\].

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

### 9.2.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

For each declared *beam*, in normal conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within ± 3.4
dB of the claimed value.

For each declared *beam*, in extreme conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within ±4.5
dB of the claimed value.

Normal and extreme conditions are defined in TS 38.141-2, annex B \[6\].

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

9.3 OTA base station output power
---------------------------------

### 9.3.1 General

OTA BS output power is declared as the TRP radiated requirement, with
the output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB during the
*transmitter ON period*. TRP does not change with beamforming settings
as long as the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak directions
set*. Thus, the TRP accuracy requirement must be met for any beamforming
setting for which the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak
directions set*.

The BS *rated carrier TRP output power* for *BS type 1-O* shall be
within limits as specified in table 9.3.1-1.

  NOTE: There is no upper limit for the **P~rated,c,TRP~** of the Wide Area Base Station.   

There is no upper limit for the *rated carrier TRP output power* of *BS
type 2-O*.

For Band n41 operation in Japan, the rated output power, P~rated,c,TRP~,
declared by the manufacturer shall be equal to or less than 20 W per 10
MHz bandwidth.

Despite the general requirements for the BS output power described in
clauses 9.3.2 -- 9.3.3, additional regional requirements might be
applicable.

NOTE: In certain regions, power limits corresponding to BS classes may
apply for *BS type 2-O*.

### 9.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

In normal conditions, the *BS type 1-O* *maximum carrier TRP output
power*, P~max,c~,~TRP~ measured at the RIB shall remain within ±2 dB of
the *rated carrier TRP output power* P~rated,c,TRP~, as declared by the
manufacturer.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.141-1, annex B \[6\].

power*, P~max,c~,~TRP~ measured at the RIB shall remain within ±3 dB of
the *rated carrier TRP output power* P~rated,c,TRP~, as declared by the
manufacturer.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.141-2, annex B \[6\].

and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

NOTE 1: The upper limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the BS
maximum carrier EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) when transmitting on all RBs. The
lower limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the average EIRP for
single RB transmission in the same direction using the same *beam*. The
OFDM symbol carries PDSCH and not contain RS or SSB.

#### 9.4.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

OTA total power dynamic range minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is

requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

#### 9.6.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For *BS type 1-O*, the modulated carrier frequency of each NR carrier
configured by the BS shall be accurate to within the accuracy range

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). Details about how the EVM is
determined are specified in Annex B for FR1 and Annex C for FR2.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

perfectly aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF signals
present in the radiated domain may experience certain timing
differences.

The TAE is specified for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission
mode, the OTA Time Alignment Error (OTA TAE) is defined as the largest
timing difference between any two different NR signals. The OTA time

9.7 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 9.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[2\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *BS channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *BS type 1-O* and *BS
type 2-O* transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel
Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).
The OTA Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions
in each supported downlink *operating band* plus the frequency ranges
Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band. OTA Unwanted emissions
outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious emissions
requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined
in table 9.7.1-1 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* for the NR
*operating bands*.

Table 9.7.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink *operating
band*

  BS type         *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  --------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  *BS type 1-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                  100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
  *BS type 2-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 3250 MHz            1500

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* or co-location requirements as
described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 9.7.2.1 General

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[3\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The OTA occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the
*transmitter ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum
requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional
requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer's declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type* 2-O

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*BS channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he OTA occupied
bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the *Aggregated BS Channel
Bandwidth.***

### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 9.7.3.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
period*.

#### 9.7.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2 + X,
6.6.3.2-2a + X (where X = 9 dB) or the ACLR (CACLR) *basic limit* in
table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-2a or 6.6.3.2-3, whichever is less stringent,
shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the ACLR
requirements in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply to *BS channel bandwidths* of
the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.6.3.2-1.For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-2a, while the CACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-3.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.6.3.2-2a, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.6.3.2-3.

#### 9.7.3.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 9.7.3.3-1.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit is specified in table 9.7.3.3-2.

The OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit in table 9.7.3.3-2 or 9.7.3.3-4a or
the ACLR (CACLR) limit in table 9.7.3.3-1, 9.7.3.3-3 or 9.7.3.3-4,
whichever is less stringent, shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the OTA ACLR
requirements in table 9.7.3.3-1 shall apply to *BS channel bandwidths*
of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in the
table.For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA ACLR
requirement in table 9.7.3.3-3 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR requirement
in table 9.7.3.3-4 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *sub-block gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 9.7.3.3-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 9.7.3.3-5.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *sub-block gap* shall be higher than the
value specified in table 9.7.3.3-4.

### 9.7.4 OTA operating band unwanted emissions

#### 9.7.4.1 General

The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as
TRP per RIB unless otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

Out-of-band emissions in FR1 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits. Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted
emission limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA,
the requirements apply to *BS channel bandwidths* of the outermost
carrier for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements
shall apply inside any *sub-block gap* for the frequency ranges defined
in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the requirements shall apply inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap* for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

The OTA operating band unwanted emission requirement for *BS type 1-O*
is that for each applicable *basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2, the power
of any unwanted emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as the
*basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB.

##### 9.7.4.2.1 Additional requirements

###### 9.7.4.2.1.1 Protection of DTT

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *BS type 1-O* operating in Band n20, the level of emissions in
the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to table 9.7.4.2.1.1-1, shall not exceed
the maximum emission TRP level shown in the table. This requirement
applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range
falls in the spurious domain.

###### 9.7.4.2.1.2 Limits in FCC Title 47

The BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits
established by FCC Title 47 \[8\], when deployed in regions where those
limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.

#### 9.7.4.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

##### 9.7.4.3.1 General

The requirements of either clause 9.7.4.3.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 9.7.4.3.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*BS type 2-O*) in
clause 9.7.5.3.2. In addition, the limits in clause 9.7.4.3.4 may also
apply.

Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits. Unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1
for the NR *operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA,
the requirements apply to the frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the
edge of the *contiguous transmission bandwidth.* In addition, for a
*RIB* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply
inside any *sub-block gap*.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *contiguous transmission bandwidth*
edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter
closest to the *contiguous transmission bandwidth* edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *contiguous transmission
bandwidth* edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In addition, inside any *sub-block gap* for a *RIB* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the *limits* specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of
the *sub-block gap*. The *limit* for each *sub-block* is specified in
clauses 9.7.4.3.2 and 9.7.4.3.3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block* gap bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 9.7.4.3.2 OTA operating band unwanted emission limits (Category A)

BS unwanted emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in
table 9.7.4.3.2‑1 and 9.7.4.3.2-2.

### 9.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 9.7.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per RIB unless
otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.5.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

##### 9.7.5.2.1 General

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from
30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-1. For
some FR1 *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating
band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[2\].

For *multi-band RIB* each supported *operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ MHz
around each band are excluded from the OTA transmitter spurious
emissions requirements.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.

*BS type 1-O* requirements consists of OTA transmitter spurious emission
requirements based on TRP and co-location requirements not based on TRP.

##### 9.7.5.2.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *BS type 1-O* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* above 30 MHz in clause 6.6.5.2.1, the TRP
of any spurious emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as the
*basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB, unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

##### 9.7.5.2.3 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a type 1-O BS.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
the power levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna*
output.

The total power of any spurious emission from both polarizations of the
*co-location reference antenna* connector output shall not exceed the
*basic limits* in clause 6.6.5.2.2 + X dB, where X = -21 dB.

##### 9.7.5.2.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink *operating
band*. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems
that are deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may
be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an
NR *operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present
document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.). The Tx additional spurious emissions
requirements for *BS type 1-O* are that for each applicable *basic
limit* in clause 6.6.5.2.3, the TRP of any spurious emission shall not
exceed an OTA limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB.

##### 9.7.5.2.5 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same
class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
the power levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna*
output(s).

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the output(s) of the *co-location reference antenna*
and shall not exceed the *basic limits* in clause 6.6.5.2.4 + X dB,
where X = -21 dB.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the exclusions and conditions in the notes
column of table 6.6.5.2.4-1 apply for each supported *operating band*.

#### 9.7.5.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

##### 9.7.5.3.1 General

In FR2, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 30 MHz
to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the downlink *operating
band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of the downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the downlink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~
is defined in table 9.7.1-1.

##### 9.7.5.3.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

###### 9.7.5.3.2.1 General

The requirements of either clause 9.7.5.3.2.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 9.7.5.3.2.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
Operating band unwanted emissions in clause 9.7.4.3.

Table 9.7.5.3.2-1: Void

NOTE: Table 9.7.5.3.2-1 is moved to clause 9.7.5.3.2.2 as Table
9.7.5.3.2.2-1.

##### 9.7.5.3.3 Additional OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band.
The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.5.

9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

### 9.8.1 General

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array from a co-located base station. The requirement shall
apply during the *transmitter ON period* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the *total radiated power* of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *co-location reference antenna*.

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is not applicable for
*BS type 2-O*.

### 9.8.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For *BS type 1-O* the transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed
the TRP unwanted emission limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious
emission in clause 9.7.5.2 (except clause 9.7.5.2.3 and clause
9.7.5.2.5), OTA operating band unwanted emissions in clause 9.7.4.2 and
OTA ACLR in clause 9.7.3.2 in the presence of a wanted signal and an
interfering signal, defined in table 9.8.2-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in multiple *operating bands*, the
requirement shall apply relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* of each *operating band*. In case the *inter RF Bandwidth gap*
is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ (where BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS
channel bandwidth* of the band), the requirement in the gap shall apply
only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls
completely within the *inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

 10 Radiated receiver characteristics
====================================

10.1 General
------------

Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for *BS type
1-H*, *BS type 1-O*, or *BS type 2-O*, with full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the
radiated receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:

\- Requirements apply during the BS receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the transmitter
unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a
*sub-block gap*.

\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for the reference direction

and

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for all other directions

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

For FR2 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction

and

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions

10.2 OTA sensitivity
--------------------

### 10.2.1 *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O*

#### 10.2.1.1 General

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a *directional requirement* based
upon the declaration of one or more *OTA sensitivity direction
declarations* (OSDD), related to a *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O*
receiver.

The *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O* may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of adjusting BS
settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity
RoAoA* resulting from the current BS settings is the active *sensitivity
RoAoA*.

If the BS is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- *BS channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target redirection
range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the BS.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 38.141‑2 \[6\].

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

NOTE 3: (Void)

If the BS is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *BS channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS
level applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 4: For BS without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

#### 10.2.1.2 Minimum requirement

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described in clause 7.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving
signal is equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set
of EIS level and *BS channel bandwidth*.

### 10.2.2 *BS type 2-O*

There is no OTA sensitivity requirement for FR2, the OTA sensitivity is
the same as the OTA reference sensitivity in clause 10.3.

10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 General

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a *directional requirement* and is
intended to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a
declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

### 10.3.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS\_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *BS channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ itself is not a
requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50MHz *BS channel bandwidth* it does not imply that BS has to
support 50MHz *BS channel bandwidth*.

For Wide Area BS, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range -96
to -119 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Medium Range BS, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
-91 to -114 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Local Area BS, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
-86 to -109 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

10.4 OTA dynamic range
----------------------

### 10.4.1 General

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *BS channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.4.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For NR, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

10.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking
-----------------------------------------

### 10.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 10.5.1.1 General

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver's
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system.

#### 10.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.2-1 and table 10.5.1.2-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base station RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 10.5.1.2-2. The OTA
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
10.5.1.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

#### 10.5.1.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.3-1 and table 10.5.1.3-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base station RF Bandwidth edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 10.5.1.3-2. The OTA
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

### 10.5.2 OTA in-band blocking

#### 10.5.2.1 General

The OTA in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver's
ability to receive a OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted OTA interferer, which is an NR signal for
general blocking or an NR signal with one RB for narrowband blocking.

#### 10.5.2.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal
specified in tables 10.5.2.2-1, table 10.5.2.2-2 and table 10.5.2.2-3
for general OTA and narrowband OTA blocking requirements. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in clause
10.3.2 and are further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The OTA in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply in
the in-band blocking frequency range, which is from F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~
to F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the
FDD *operating band.* The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-O* is defined in table
10.5.2.2-0.

Table 10.5.2.2-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands in FR1*

  BS type         *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  --------------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------
  *BS type 1-O*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                  100 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.2-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block edges* inside the *sub-block* gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
the in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating
band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 10.5.2.2-1
and 10.5.2.2-3.

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply
in the narrowband blocking frequency ranges for each supported
*operating band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.2-3.

#### 10.5.2.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For *BS type 2-O*, the OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals are
provided at RIB using the parameters in table 10.5.2.3-1 for general OTA
blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the
interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The OTA blocking requirements are applicable outside the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*.

For *BS type 2-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply from
F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~*.* The Δf~OOB~ for *BS
type 2-O* is defined in table 10.5.2.3-0.

Table 10.5.2.3-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands in FR2*

  BS type         *Operating band* characteristics       Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  --------------- -------------------------------------- ---------------
  *BS type 2-O*   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 3250 MHz   1500

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA blocking requirements apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 10.5.2.3-1.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block*
edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

10.6 OTA out-of-band blocking
-----------------------------

### 10.6.1 General

The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the
receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the *RIB* at its
assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.

### 10.6.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

#### 10.6.2.1 General minimum requirement

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.* The interferer shall be
*polarization match*ed in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the OTA out-of-band requirement shall apply for
each supported *operating band*, with the exception that the in-band
blocking frequency ranges of all supported *operating bands* according
to clause 7.4.2.2 shall be excluded from the OTA out‑of‑band blocking
requirement.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 30
MHz to F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750
MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band*
for BS supporting FDD. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-O* is defined in table
10.5.2.2-0.

#### 10.6.2.2 Co-location minimum requirement

This additional OTA out-of-band blocking requirement may be applied for
the protection of BS receivers when NR, E‑UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
a BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna* conducted
input. The interfering signal power is specified per supported
polarization.

The requirement is valid over the *minSENS RoAoA*.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA blocking requirement for co-location with BS
in other frequency bands is applied for all *operating bands* for which
co-location protection is provided.

10.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions
------------------------------------

### 10.7.1 General

The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from
the antenna array from a receiver unit.

The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions for *BS type
1-O* and *BS type 2-O* is *total radiated power* (TRP), with the
requirement defined at the RIB.

### 10.7.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For a BS operating in FDD, OTA RX spurious emissions requirements do not
apply as they are superseded by the OTA TX spurious emissions
requirement. This is due to the fact that TX and RX spurious emissions
cannot be distinguished in OTA domain.

For a BS operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirement
shall apply during the *transmitter OFF period* only.

For RX only *multi-band RIB*, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirements
are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating band*.

The OTA RX spurious emissions requirement for *BS type 1-O* is that for
each *basic limit* specified in table 10.7.2‑1*,* the power sum of
emissions at the RIB shall not exceed limits specified as the *basic
limit* + X, where X = 9 dB, unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

In addition to the requirements in Table 10.7.3-1, the requirement for
protection of EESS for BS operating in frequency range 24.25 - 27.5 GHz
in clause 9.7.5.3.3 may be applied.

10.8 OTA receiver intermodulation
---------------------------------

### 10.8.1 General

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver unit to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal. The requirement is
defined as a *directional requirement* at the *RIB*.

### 10.8.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB with the conditions
specified in tables 10.8.2-1 and 10.8.2-2 for intermodulation
performance and in tables 10.8.2-3 and 10.8.2-4 for narrowband
intermodulation performance.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.3.2-1, table 10.3.2-2 and table 10.3.2-3 for each *BS channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal, except for the
case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60kHz and *BS channel
bandwidth* \<=20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the interfering
signal shall be 30kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall apply
in addition inside any *sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at
least as wide as the *BS channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal
in tables 10.8.2-2 and 10.8.2-4. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the intermodulation requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency offset
from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in case the gap
size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in tables 10.8.2-2
and 10.8.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

### 10.8.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

Throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in tables 10.8.3-1 and 10.8.3-2. All of the OTA test signals
arrive from the same direction, and the requirement is valid if the
signals arrive from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.3.3-1 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*.

10.9 OTA in-channel selectivity
-------------------------------

### 10.9.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral
density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an NR signal as specified in annex A.1 and shall be time aligned with
the wanted signal.

### 10.9.2 Minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For *BS type 1-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.2-1 for Wide Area BS, in
table 10.9.2-2 for Medium Range BS and in table 10.9.2-3 for Local Area
BS. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified
in annex D.

### 10.9.3 Minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For *BS type 2-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.3-1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

Table 10.9.3-3: (Void)

 11 Radiated performance requirements
====================================

11.1 General
------------

### 11.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-O* or *BS type 2-O* to correctly demodulate radiated signals in
various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements
are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the BS are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation conditions in
annex G. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by
the BS.

The radiated performance requirements for *BS type 1-O* and for the *BS
type 2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulation branches* as described in
clause 11.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches* depending on the number of polarizations
supported by the BS, with the required SNR applied separately per
polarization.

NOTE 1: The BS can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*, however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches*.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a BS
supporting CA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For *BS type 1-O* in FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be
met with the transmitter units associated with the RIB in the
*operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE 2: *BS type 1-O* in normal operating conditions in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the tests.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided from the BS to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the same duration where signal energy exists on a RIB.

### 11.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *BS type 1-O*, or the *BS type 2-O* uses polarization diversity
and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each
of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX
test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*, each
demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *BS type 1-O*, or the *BS type 2-O* does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for
a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

11.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
---------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 Requirements for *BS type 1-O*

#### 11.2.1.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.1 for 2Rx.

#### 11.2.1.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.2 for 2Rx.

#### 11.2.1.3 Requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.3 for 2Rx.

### 11.2.2 Requirements for *BS type 2-O*

#### 11.2.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

##### 11.2.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 11.2.2.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

##### 11.2.2.2.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 11.2.2.3 Requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

##### 11.2.2.3.1 General

In the tests for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, and there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The CSI part 1 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1
information is sent as follow:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 1)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 1 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1information
transmitted occasions.

The CSI part 2 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the CSI part 2 information when the
CSI part 2 information is sent as follows:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 2)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 2 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information
transmitted occasions.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0 c1 c2 c3 c4\]
= \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the
RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\] for CSI part2
information.

The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

#### 11.3.2.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

##### 11.3.2.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

###### 11.3.2.3.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./media/image24.wmf){width="4.2in" height="0.4in"}

where:

\- ![](./media/image25.wmf){width="1.2in" height="0.2in"} denotes the
total number of NACK bits transmitted

\- ![](./media/image26.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.2in"} denotes the
number of NACK bits decoded as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number
of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

#### 11.3.2.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

##### 11.3.2.5.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-2 \[18\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

11.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
---------------------------------------

### 11.4.1 Requirements for *BS type 1-O*

#### 11.4.1.1 PRACH False alarm probability

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.4.1 for 2Rx.

#### 11.4.1.2 PRACH detection requirements

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.4.2 for 2Rx.

### 11.4.2 Requirements for *BS type 2-O*

#### 11.4.2.1 PRACH False alarm probability

##### 11.4.2.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

##### 11.4.2.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

#### 11.4.2.2 PRACH detection requirements

##### 11.4.2.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN and TDLA30-300, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the
strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance given in Table
11.4.2.2-1.

The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-2 and the
test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

##### 11.4.2.2.2 Minimum requirements

The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in Tables 11.4.2.2.2-1 to 11.4.2.2.2-2.

########  Annex B (normative): Error Vector Magnitude (FR1)

B.1 Reference point for measurement
===================================

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure B.1-1 below.

Figure B.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

B.2 Basic unit of measurement
=============================

The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one slot in the time
domain and subcarriers in the frequency domain:

where

*T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

is the set of subcarriers within the subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

*is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in
accordance with relevant Tx models,

is the modified signal under test defined in annex B.3.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals. The boundaries of the 10 ms measurement
intervals need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

B.3 Modified signal under test
==============================

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalized and decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal. Note that two timing
offsets are determined, the corresponding EVM is measured and the
maximum used as described in annex B.7.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

B.4 Estimation of frequency offset
==================================

The observation period for determining the frequency offset shall be 1
slot.

B.5 Estimation of time offset
=============================

B.5.1 General
-------------

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
shall be 1 slot.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length *W* (defined in annex B.5.2) or the last sample of the first
window half if *W* is even.

is estimated so that the EVM window of length *W* is centred on the
measured cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To minimize the
estimation error the timing shall be based on demodulation reference
signals. To limit time distortion of any transmit filter the reference
signals in the 1 outer RBs are not taken into account in the timing
estimation

Two values for are determined:

and

where if *W* is odd and if *W* is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol then *T*
shall be further restricted to the subset of symbols with the considered
modulation scheme being active and with the considered cyclic prefix
length type.

B.5.2 Window length
-------------------

Table B.5.2-1, B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 specify the EVM window length (*W*) for
normal CP.

B.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters
======================================================================

The equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image48.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.21875in"}and ![](./media/image49.wmf){width="0.40625in"
height="0.21875in"} are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image50.wmf){width="0.5520833333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} and the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image51.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"}, for each reference signal, over 10ms
measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image52.wmf){width="1.7708333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

Where the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image51.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"} is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters: i.e. nominal demodulation reference signals, (all
other modulation symbols are set to 0 V), nominal carrier frequency,
nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier, nominal
timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10ms measurement interval.
Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image53.wmf){width="0.53125in" height="0.25in"} an unwrap
operation must be performed according to the following definition: The
unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
![](./media/image54.wmf){width="0.53125in" height="0.25in"} by adding
multiples of 2\*PI when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time
instances t~i~ are greater than or equal to the jump tolerance of PI
radians. This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

![](./media/image55.wmf){width="1.3020833333333333in"
height="0.6458333333333334in"}

![](./media/image56.wmf){width="1.3541666666666667in"
height="0.6458333333333334in"}

Where *N* is the number of reference signal; time-domain locations
*t~i~* from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each reference signal subcarrier
![](./media/image57.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.21875in"}.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image58.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.23958333333333334in"}
and ![](./media/image59.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"} at the reference signal subcarriers are
obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every second
subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over
the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS reference signal
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when the number of
available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs
is smaller than the moving average window size, the window size is
reduced accordingly as per figure B.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image58.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.23958333333333334in"}
and ![](./media/image59.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"} to compute coefficients
![](./media/image60.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.21875in"}, ![](./media/image61.wmf){width="0.40625in"
height="0.21875in"} for each subcarrier.

Figure B.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain

B.7 Averaged EVM
================

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval.

For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the $N_{\text{dl}}$ slot
duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation
step.

![](./media/image63.wmf){width="2.28125in" height="0.78125in"}

*- Where Ni* is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

\- The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

\- Thus ![](./media/image64.wmf){width="0.71875in" height="0.25in"} is
calculated using ![](./media/image65.wmf){width="0.625in"
height="0.25in"}in the expressions above and
![](./media/image66.wmf){width="0.7604166666666666in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} is calculated using
![](./media/image67.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"} in the
![](./media/image68.wmf){width="0.6770833333333334in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"} calculation.

\- Thus we get:

$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

For TDD, let $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with
downlink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval, the averaging in
the time domain can be calculated from $\ N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$
slots of different 10 ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum
of $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots averaging length where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

*-* ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the
EVM results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide
the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

$${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$$

*- Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

*-* The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

*-* In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the
minimum integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where
$N_{\text{frame}}$ is determined by.

$$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$$

and $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for 30
kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.

*-* Unite by RMS.

$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$$

########  Annex C (normative): Error Vector Magnitude (FR2)

C.1 Reference point for measurement
===================================

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure C.1-1 below.

Figure C.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

C.2 Basic unit of measurement
=============================

The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one slot in the time
domain and subcarriers in the frequency domain:

where

is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the slot,

is the set of subcarriers within the subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

*is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in
accordance with relevant Tx models,

is the modified signal under test defined in C.3.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over 10 ms measurement intervals to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals. The boundaries of the 10 ms measurement
intervals need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

C.3 Modified signal under test
==============================

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalized and decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal. Note that two timing
offsets are determined, the corresponding EVM is measured and the
maximum used as described in C.7.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

C.4 Estimation of frequency offset
==================================

The observation period for determining the frequency offset shall be 1
slot.

C.5 Estimation of time offset
=============================

C.5.1 General
-------------

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
shall be 1 slot.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length (defined in C.5.2) or the last sample of the first window half if
is even.

is estimated so that the EVM window of length is centred on the measured
cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To minimize the estimation
error the timing shall be based on the reference signals. To limit time
distortion of any transmit filter the reference signals in the 1 outer
RBs are not taken into account in the timing estimation

Two values for are determined:

and

where if is odd and if is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol then shall be
further restricted to the subset of symbols with the considered
modulation scheme being active and with the considered cyclic prefix
length type.

C.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters
======================================================================

The equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image48.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.21875in"}and ![](./media/image49.wmf){width="0.40625in"
height="0.21875in"} are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image50.wmf){width="0.5520833333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} and the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image51.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"}, for each reference signal, over 10ms
measurement intervals. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image52.wmf){width="1.7708333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

Where the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image51.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"} is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals and nominal PT-RS if present
(all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10ms measurement interval.
Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image53.wmf){width="0.53125in" height="0.25in"} an unwrap
operation must be performed according to the following definition: The
unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
![](./media/image54.wmf){width="0.53125in" height="0.25in"} by adding
multiples of 2\*PI when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time
instances t~i~ are greater than or equal to the jump tolerance of PI
radians. This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

$${a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}
}{\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}}$$

Where *N* is the number of reference signal time-domain locations *t~i~*
from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each reference signal subcarrier
![](./media/image57.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.21875in"}.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image58.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.23958333333333334in"}
and ![](./media/image59.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"} at the reference signal subcarriers are
obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every second
subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over
the DM-RS subcarriers in allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near
the edge of the channel, or when the number of available DM-RS
subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than
the moving average window size, the window size is reduced accordingly
as per figure C.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image58.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.23958333333333334in"}
and ![](./media/image59.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"} to compute coefficients
![](./media/image60.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.21875in"}, ![](./media/image61.wmf){width="0.40625in"
height="0.21875in"} for each subcarrier. To account for the common phase
error (CPE) experienced in millimetre wave frequencies,
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$, in the estimated coefficients contain phase
rotation due to the CPE, $\theta$, in addition to the phase of the
equalizer coefficient $\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$, that is

$$\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) + \theta(t)$$

For OFDM symbols where PT-RS does not exist, $\theta(t)$ can be
estimated by performing linear interpolation from neighboring symbols
where PT-RS is present.

In order to separate component of the CPE,$\text{\ θ}$, contained in,
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$, estimation and compensation of the CPE needs to
follow.$\ \theta(t)$ is the common phase error (CPE), that rotates all
the subcarriers of the OFDM symbol at time $t$.

Estimate of the CPE, $\theta(t)$, at OFDM symbol time, $t$, can then be
obtained from using the PT-RS employing the expression

$$\widetilde{\theta}(t) = \arg\left\{ \sum_{{f \in f}^{\text{ptrs}}}^{}\left( \frac{Z^{'}\left( t,f \right)}{I_{\text{ptrs}}\left( t,f \right)} \right)\ \left( \widetilde{a}\left( f \right)e^{- j\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right)} \right) \right\}$$

In the above equation, $f^{\text{ptrs}}$ is the set of subcarriers where
PT-RS are mapped, ${t \in t}^{\text{ptrs}}$ where $t^{\text{ptrs}}$ is
the set of OFDM symbols where PT-RS are mapped while
$Z^{'}\left( t,f \right)$ and $I_{\text{ptrs}}\left( t,f \right)$ are is
the post-FFT acquired signal and the ideal PT-RS signal respectively.
That is, estimate of the CPE at a given OFDM symbol is obtained from
frequency correlation of the complex ratios at the PT-RS positions with
the conjugate of the estimated equalizer complex coefficients. The
estimated CPE can be subtracted from
$\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to remove influence of the CPE, and
obtain estimate of the complex coefficient's phase

$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \overline{\varphi}\left( f \right) - \widetilde{\theta}$(t)

C.7 Averaged EVM
================

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$\ N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in
a 10 ms measurement interval.

For TDD, let $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with
downlink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval, the averaging in
the time domain can be calculated
$\text{from\ }N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ slots of different 10 ms
measurement intervals and should have a minimum of $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots
averaging length where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.

*-* ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the
EVM results in each 10 ms measurement intervals. Sum the squares, divide
the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

$${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$$

*- Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

*-* The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

*-* In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the
minimum integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where
$N_{\text{frame}}$ is determined by.

$$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$$

and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 8$ for
120 kHz SCS.

*-* Unite by RMS.

$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{frame,k}^{2}}$$

######## Annex F (normative): Relationship between EIRP based regulatory requirements and 3GPP requirements

F.1 General
===========

This annex applies to FR1 *BS type 1-C*, *BS type 1-H* and *BS type
1-O*.

Some regional requirements are defined per effective isotropic radiated
power (EIRP), which is a combination of the transmitted power (or in
some cases spectral density) and the effective antenna gain which is a
site-specific condition. Such requirements may be applied per antenna,
per cell, or per base station. It shall be noted that the definition of
BS or cell may differ between regulations.

The regulations are based on the assumption on *BS type 1-C* conducted
requirements and a passive antenna and must be interpreted for active
antenna systems that have active beamforming. This annex describes how
the power per connector and sum power over *TAB connectors* can be
related to such requirements.

Where the regulator prescribes a method for EIRP calculation, that
method supersedes the proposed assessment in this annex.

F.2 Relationship between EIRP based regulatory requirements and conducted requirements
======================================================================================

When 3GPP specifications mandate manufacturer declarations of the
(conducted) output power or power spectral density per connector for the
base station under the reference conditions stated as a way to
accommodate the referred regional requirements without putting
requirements on the local site conditions.

For the case when the base station manufacturer maximum output power or
unwanted emission declarations apply per connector, the maximum EIRP can
be estimated using the following formulas:

EIRP per antenna (applicable for *BS type 1-C*): P~EIRP~ = P~Tx~ +
G~Ant~

EIRP per cell or per BS (applicable for *BS type 1-H*): P~EIRPcell~ =10
\* log (∑10^PEIRPn/10^)

In case the EIRP requirement is set per polarization, the summation
shall be made per polarization.

\- \"P~EIRP~\" is the resulting effective isotropic radiated power (or
radiated power spectral density) resulting from the power (or power
spectral density) declared by the manufacturer in dBm (or
dBm/measurement BW).

\- \"P~Tx~\" is the conducted power or power spectral density declared
by the manufacturer in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW).

\- \"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, calculated as the antenna
gain (dBi) minus the loss of the site infrastructure connecting the BS
*antenna connector* with the antenna (dB) for the applied frequency. The
antenna nominal gain is only applicable within a certain frequency
range. For *BS type 1-H*, G~Ant~ shall be an assumption on the gain of a
passive antenna system in order to provide a total power emissions level
comparable to the level obtained when a *BS type 1-C* is connected to a
passive antenna. A typical example of a passive antenna gain, as used
for *BS type 1-O*, is 17 dBi.

\- \"n\" is the index number of the co-located antennas illuminating the
same cell. P~EIRPn~ is the P~EIRP~ of the *n*th antenna.

\- \"Cell\" is in this annex used in the sense that it is the limited
geographical area covered by the carrier transmitted from one site.

F.3 Relationship between EIRP based regulatory requirements and OTA requirements
================================================================================

The regulations set an EIRP limit considering a passive antenna BS.
Although the gain of passive antennas may vary somewhat, the variation
is in the order of a few dBs. The gain variation of a *BS type 1-O* may
be much larger. However, *BS type 1-O* unwanted emissions requirements
are defined as TRP, since TRP impacts co-existence properties.

In order to relate the EIRP values in the specifications to TRP, a fixed
assumption has been made on the gain of a typical passive BS antenna.

Thus, the maximum TRP can be estimated using the following formulas:

TRP limit per antenna: P~TRP,\ antenna~ = P~EIRP~ - G~Ant~

TRP limit per cell or per BS: P~TRP~ =P~TRP,antenna~ + 9 dB

It is noted that the *BS type 1-O* architecture assumes that a BS
subject to OTA requirements will have at least 8 antennas.

In case the TRP requirement is set per polarization, the summation shall
be made per polarization.

\- \"P~EIRP~\" is the effective isotropic radiated power (or radiated
power spectral density) set in the regulation (assuming a passive BS
antenna) in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW).

\- \"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, the antenna gain (dBi) is a
fixed reference value of 17 dBi. Directivity value should be used in
above equations, however with all antenna losses are assumed zero then
we can use effective antenna gain.

######## Annex G (Normative): Propagation conditions

G.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

\- Different models are used for FR1 and FR2.

G.2.1 Delay profiles
--------------------

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[16\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.1.1 and G.2.1.2 can be used as such.

Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[16\].

Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[16\].

Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them
by calculating their linear power sum.

Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
taps as follows

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)

• If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows

• Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of the
weakest tap and the second delay tap.

• Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows

• Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

• Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise

• For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

o When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

▪ Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

o Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

• To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

• When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

• When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

• Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power) . The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8
dB)

Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of
the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2, G.2.1.1-3,
G.2.1.1-4, and G.2.1.2-2 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### G.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in table G.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables G.2.1.1-2 \~ G.2.1.1-4.

multi-path fading environment are indicated as a combination of a
channel model name and a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e.,
TDLA\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>, TDLB\<DS\>-\<Doppler\> or TDLC\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>

---------------------------------------

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in G.2.3 apply for the
antenna configuration using uniform linear arrays at both gNB and UE and
for the antenna configuration using cross polarized antennas.

### G.2.3.1 MIMO Correlation Matrices using Uniform Linear Array (ULA)

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in G.2.3.1 apply for the
antenna configuration using uniform linear array (ULA) at both gNB and
UE.

G.2.3.1.2-1.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in Table G.2.3.1.2-2, G.2.3.1.2-3 and G.2.3.1.2-4 as below.

The values in Table G.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4-digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

Where the value "a" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is
used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
Table G.2.3.1.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4-digit precision with a =0.00012.

medium and low correlation but performance requirements exist only for
low correlation.

### G.2.3.2 Multi-Antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in G.2.3.2 apply to two
cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both UE and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

#### G.2.3.2.1 Definition of MIMO Correlation Matrices using cross polarized antennas

For the channel spatial correlation matrix, the following is used:

Where

\- ![](./media/image111.wmf){width="0.3020833333333333in"
height="0.21875in"} is the spatial correlation matrix at the UE with
