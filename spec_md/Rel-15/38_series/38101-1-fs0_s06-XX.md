6 Transmitter characteristics
=============================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified
at the antenna connector of the UE with a single or multiple transmit
antenna(s). For UE with integral antenna only, a reference antenna with
a gain of 0 dBi is assumed.

Transmitter requirements for UL MIMO operation apply when the UE
transmits on 2 ports on the same CDM group. The UE may use higher MPR
values outside this limitation.

6.2 Transmitter power
---------------------

### 6.2.1 UE maximum output power

The following UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any
transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth of NR carrier unless
otherwise stated. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub
frame (1ms).

### 6.2.2 UE maximum output power reduction

UE is allowed to reduce the maximum output power due to higher order
modulations and transmit bandwidth configurations. For UE power class 2
and 3, the allowed maximum power reduction (MPR) is defined in Table
6.2.2-2 and Table 6.2.2-1, respectively for channel bandwidths that
meets both following criteria:

Channel bandwidth ≤ 100 MHz.

Relative channel bandwidth ≤ 4 % for TDD bands and ≤ 3 % for FDD bands

Where relative channel bandwith = 2\*BW~Channel~ / (F~UL\_low~ +
F~UL\_high~)

The allowed MPR for SRS, PUCCH formats 0, 1, 3 and 4, and PRACH shall be
as specified for QPSK modulated DFT-s-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation.
The allowed MPR for PUCCH format 2 shall be as specified for QPSK
modulated CP-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation.

Where the following parameters are defined to specify valid RB
allocation ranges for Outer and Inner RB allocations:

N~RB~ is the maximum number of RBs for a given Channel bandwidth and
sub-carrier spacing defined in Table 5.3.2-1. RB~Start,Low~ = max(1,
floor(L~CRB~/2))

where max() indicates the largest value of all arguments and floor(x) is
the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

RB~Start,High~ = N~RB~ -- RB~Start,Low~ -- L~CRB~

The RB allocation is an Inner RB allocation if the following conditions
are met

RB~Start,Low~ ≤ RB~Start~ ≤ RB~Start,High~, and

L~CRB~ ≤ ceil(N~RB~/2)

where ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

An Edge RB allocation is the one for which the RB(s) is (are) allocated
at the lowermost or uppermost edge of the channel with L~CRB~ ≤ 2 RBs.

The RB allocation is an Outer RB allocation for all other allocations
which are not an Inner RB allocation or Edge RB allocation.

If CP-OFDM allocation satisfies following conditions, it is considered
as almost contiguous allocation

N~RB\_gap~ / (N~RB\_alloc~ + N~RB\_gap~ ) ≤ 0.25

and N~RB\_alloc~ + N~RB\_gap~ is larger than 106, 51 or 24 RBs for 15
kHz, 30 kHz or 60 kHz respectively where N~RB\_gap~ is the total number
of unallocated RBs between allocated RBs and N~RB\_alloc~ is the total
number of allocated RBs. The size and location of allocated and
unallocated RBs are restricted by RBG parameters specified in clause
6.1.2.2 of TS 38.214 \[10\]. For UE that indicates support for
*almostContiguousCP-OFDM-UL*, the almost contiguous signals in power
class 3, the allowed maximum power reduction defined in Table 6.2.2-1 is
increased by

CEIL{ 10 log~10~(1 + N~RB\_gap\ /~ N~RB\_alloc~), 0.5 } dB,

where CEIL{x,0.5} means x rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB. The
parameter of L~CRB~ which is used to specify valid RB allocation ranges
for Outer and Inner RB allocations is replaced by (N~RB\_alloc~ +
N~RB\_gap~) for almost contiguous allocation cases

RB~Start,Low~ = max(1, floor((N~RB\_alloc~ + N~RB\_gap~)/2))

RB~Start,High~ = N~RB~ -- RB~Start,Low~ -- N~RB\_alloc~ --N~RB\_gap~

For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits
specified in clause 6.2.4 apply.

### 6.2.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction

#### 6.2.3.1 General

Additional emission requirements can be signalled by the network. Each
additional emission requirement is associated with a unique network
signalling (NS) value indicated in RRC signalling by an NR frequency
band number of the applicable operating band and an associated value in
the field *additionalSpectrumEmission.* Throughout this specification,
the notion of indication or signalling of an NS value refers to the
corresponding indication of an NR frequency band number of the
applicable operating band, the IE field *freqBandIndicatorNR* and an
associated value of *additionalSpectrumEmission* in the relevant RRC
information elements \[7\]*.*

To meet the additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction
(A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table
6.2.1-1. Unless stated otherwise, the total reduction to UE maximum
output power is max(MPR, A-MPR) where MPR is defined in clause 6.2.2.
Outer and inner allocation notation used in clause 6.2.3 is defined in
clause 6.2.2. Unless stated otherwise, Edge RB allocations get the same
AMPR as Outer RB allocations. In absense of modulation and waveform
types the A-MPR applies to all modulation and waveform types.

Table 6.2.3.1-1 specifies the additional requirements with their
associated network signalling values and the allowed A-MPR and
applicable operating band(s) for each NS value. In case of a power class
3 UE, when IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1, power class 2 A-MPR
values apply. The mapping of NR frequency band numbers and values of the
*additionalSpectrumEmission* to network signalling labels is specified
in Table 6.2.3.1-1A.

For almost contiguous allocations in CP-OFDM waveforms in power class 3,
the allowed A-MPR defined in clause 6.2.3 is increased by CEIL{10
log~10~(1 + N~RB\_gap\ /~ N~RB\_alloc~), 0.5} dB, where CEIL{x, 0.5}
means x rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB, N~RB\_gap~ is the total
number of unallocated RBs between allocated RBs and N~RB\_alloc~ is the
total number of allocated RBs, and the parameter L~CRB~ is replaced by
N~RB\_alloc~ + N~RB\_gap~ in specifying the RB allocation regions.

#### 6.2.3.2 A-MPR for NS\_04

For NS\_04, A-MPR is not added to MPR. Also, when NS\_04 is signalled,
MPR shall be set to zero in the P~CMAX~ equations to avoid double
counting MPR.

Allowed maximum power reduction is defined as A-MPR = max(MPR, A-MPR\'),

Note that A-MPR\' = 0 dB means only MPR is applied,

where A-MPR\' is defined as

if RB~start~ ≤ f~start,max,IMD3~ / (12⋅SCS) and L~CRB~ ≤ AW~max,IMD3~ /
(12⋅SCS) and F~C~ - BW~Channel~/2 \< F~UL\_low~ + offset~IMD3~,\
then

the A-MPR\' is defined according to Table 6.2.3.2-2 PC3\_A2 relative to
23 dBm for power class 3 and PC2\_A4 relative to 26 dBm for power class
2,

else,

if RB~start~ ≤ L~CRB~/2 + ∆~start~ / (12⋅SCS) and L~CRB~ ≤
AW~max,regrowth~ / (12⋅SCS) and F~C~ - BW~Channel~/2 \< F~UL\_low~ +
offset~regrowth~,\
then

the A-MPR\' is defined according to Table 6.2.3.2-2 PC3\_A1 relative to
23 dBm for power class 3 and PC2\_A3 relative to 26 dBm for power class
2,

else

A-MPR\' = 0 dB and apply MPR.

With the parameters defined in Table 6.2.3.2-1.

Table 6.2.3.6-3: Void

When NS\_43U is signalled for 5 and 10 MHz channel bandwidths A-MPR is
defined in Table 6.2.3.1-2 except for DFT-s-OFDM QPSK when L~CRB~ \> 5.4
MHz/12/SCS the A-MPR is 2.5 dB. For 15 MHz channel bandwidth Table
6.2.3.6-4 applies.

### 6.2.4 Configured transmitted power

The UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,f,c~
for carrier f of serving cell c in each slot. The configured maximum
output power P~CMAX,f,c~ is set within the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ with

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ = MIN {P~EMAX,c~-- ∆T~C,c~, (P~PowerClass~ --
ΔP~PowerClass~) -- MAX(MAX(MPR~c~, A-MPR~c~)+ ΔT~IB,c~ + ∆T~C,c~ +
∆T~RxSRS~, P-MPR~c~) }

P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ = MIN {P~EMAX,c~, P~PowerClass~ -- ΔP~PowerClass~ }

where

P~EMAX,c~ is the value given by either the *p-Max* IE or the field
*additionalPmax* of the *NR-NS-PmaxList IE*, whichever is applicable
according to TS 38.331\[7\];

P~PowerClass~ is the maximum UE power specified in Table 6.2.1-1 without
taking into account the tolerance specified in the Table 6.2.1-1;

When the IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1, P~EMAX,c~ is increased by
+3 dB for a power class 3 UE operating in TDD bands n40, n41, n77, n78,
and n79 with PI/2 BPSK modulation and UE indicates support for UE
capability *powerBoosting-pi2BPSK* and 40% or less symbols in certain
evaluation period are used for UL transmission when P~EMAX,c~ ≥ 20 dBm
(The exact evaluation period is no less than one radio frame).

When the IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1, ΔP~PowerClass~ = -3 dB for
a power class 3 UE operating in TDD bands n40, n41, n77, n78, and n79
with Pi/2 BPSK modulation and UE indicates support for UE capability
*powerBoosting-pi2BPSK* and 40% or less slots in radio frame are used
for UL transmission.

ΔP~PowerClass~ = 3 dB for a power class 2 UE when P-max of 23 dBm or
lower is indicated; or when the field of UE capability
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is absent and the percentage of uplink
symbols transmitted in a certain evalutation period is larger than 50%;
or when the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is not
absent and the percentage of uplink symbols transmitted in a certain
evaluation period is larger than *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* as defined
in TS 38.331 (The exact evaluation period is no less than one radio
frame); otherwise ΔP~PowerClass~ = 0 dB;

∆T~IB,c~ is the additional tolerance for serving cell c as specified in
clause 6.2A.4.2 for NR CA, clause 6.2C.2 for SUL, or TS 38.101-3 clause
6.2B.4.2 for EN-DC; ∆T~IB,c~ = 0 dB otherwise; In case the UE supports
more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL or DC, and an operating
band belongs to more than one band combinations then

a\) When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ∆T~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 6.2A.4.2, 6.2C.2 in this specification and 6.2B.4.2 in
TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
∆T~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

b\) When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ∆T~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 6.2A.4.2, 6.2C.2 in this specification and 6.2B.4.2 in
TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

∆T~C,c~ = 1.5dB when NOTE 3 in Table 6.2.1-1 in 38.101-1 applies for a
serving cell c, otherwise ∆T~C,c~ = 0 dB ;

MPR~c~ and A-MPR~c~ for serving cell c are specified in clause 6.2.2 and
clause 6.2.3, respectively;

∆T~RxSRS~ is applied during SRS transmission occasions with *usage* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set as 'antennaSwitching' when

a\) UE transmits SRS on the second SRS resource in every configured SRS
resource set when the *SRS-TxSwitch* capability is indicated as \'t1r2\'

b\) UE transmits SRS on the second, third and fourth SRS resources of
the total 4 SRS resources from all configured SRS resource set(s)
consisting of one SRS port when the *SRS-TxSwitch* capability is
indicated as \'t1r4\' or, \'t1r4-t2r4\' but in 't1r4' mode.

c\) UE transmits SRS from the SRS port pair on the second SRS resource
in every configured SRS resource set consisting of two SRS ports when
the *SRS-TxSwitch* capability is indicated as \'t2r4\' or \'t1r4-t2r4\'
but in 't2r4' mode, or

d\) UE transmits SRS to a DL-only carrier.

The value of ∆T~RxSRS~ is 4.5dB for n79 and 3 dB for bands whose
F~UL\_high~ is lower than the F~UL\_low~ of n79 when the device is power
class 3 in the band, or when the device is power class 2 in the band and
ΔP~PowerClass~ = 3 dB. The value of ∆T~RxSRS~ is 7.5dB for n79 and 6 dB
for bands whose F~UL\_high~ is lower than the F~UL\_low~ of n79 when the
device is power class 2 in the band and ΔP~PowerClass~ = 0 dB.

For other SRS transmissions ∆T~RxSRS~ is zero;

P-MPR~c~ is the power management maximum power reduction for

a\) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy
absorption requirements and addressing unwanted emissions / self desense
requirements in case of simultaneous transmissions on multiple RAT(s)
for scenarios not in scope of 3GPP RAN specifications;

b\) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy
absorption requirements in case of proximity detection is used to
address such requirements that require a lower maximum output power.

The UE shall apply P-MPR~c~ for serving cell c only for the above cases.
For UE conducted conformance testing P-MPR~c~ shall be 0 dB

NOTE 1: P-MPRc was introduced in the PCMAX,f,c equation such that the UE
can report to the gNB the available maximum output transmit power. This
information can be used by the gNB for scheduling decisions.

NOTE 2: P-MPRc may impact the maximum uplink performance for the
selected UL transmission path.

T~REF~ and T~eval~ are specified in Table 6.2.4-1. For each T~REF~, the
P~CMAX,L,c~ for serving cell c are evaluated per T~eval~ and given by
the minimum value taken over the transmission(s) within the T~eval~; the
minimum P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ over one or more T~eval~ is then applied for the
entire T~REF~

Table 6.2.4-1: Evaluation and reference periods for Pcmax

  ------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Physical channel length   Physical channel length   Min(*T~no\_hopping~*, Physical Channel Length)

The measured configured maximum output power P~UMAX,f,c~ shall be within
the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ -- MAX{T~L,c~, T(P~CMAX\_L,f,c~)} ≤ P~UMAX,f,c~ ≤
P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ + T(P~CMAX\_H,f,c~).

where the tolerance T(P~CMAX,f,c~) for applicable values of P~CMAX,f,c~
is specified in Table 6.2.4-1. The tolerance T~L,c~ is the absolute
value of the lower tolerance for the applicable operating band as
specified in Table 6.2.1-1.

#### 6.2A.1.3 UE maximum output power for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the transmitter power requirements in clause 6.2 apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
UE maximum output power shall be measured over all component carriers
from different bands. If each band has separate antenna connectors,
maximum output power is measured as the sum of maximum output power at
each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement shall be at least
one sub frame (1 ms). The maximum output power is specified in Table
6.2A.1.3-1.

### 6.2A.2 UE maximum output power reduction for CA

#### 6.2A.2.1 Void

#### 6.2A.2.2 Void

#### 6.2A.2.3 UE maximum output power reduction for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the requirements in subclause 6.2.2 apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the requirements in clause 6.2.2 apply for each uplink component
carrier.

### 6.2A.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for CA

##### 6.2A.3.1.1 Void

##### 6.2A.3.1.2 Void

##### 6.2A.3.1.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for Inter-band CA

Unless otherwise stated, for inter-band carrier aggregation with one
uplink carrier assigned to one NR band, the requirements in subclause
6.2.3 apply.

Unless specified in Table 6.2A.3.1.3-1, for inter-band carrier
aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands, the requirements in
clause 6.2.3 apply only to the indicated carrier. The requirements in
Table 6.2A.3.1.3-1 are specified in terms of an additional spectrum
emission requirement with their associated network signalling values and
the allowed A-MPR. Unless otherwise stated, the combined requirements
and allowed A-MPR are applicable on both bands when both component
carriers are active.. Additional spurious emission requirements are
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet the
additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the
cell handover/broadcast message.

To meet the additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction
(A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table
6.2.1-1. Unless stated otherwise, the total reduction to UE maximum
output power is max(MPR, A-MPR) where MPR is defined in clause 6.2.2. In
case of a power class 3 UE, when IE powerBoostPi2BPSK is set to 1, power
class 2 A-MPR values apply.

For almost contiguous allocations in CP-OFDM waveforms in power class 3,
the allowed A-MPR defined in clause 6.2.3 is increased by CEIL{ 10
log10(1 + NRB\_gap / NRB\_alloc), 0.5 } dB, where NRB\_gap is the total
number of unallocated RBs between allocated RBs and NRB\_alloc is the
total number of allocated RBs, and the parameter LCRB is replaced by
NRB\_alloc + NRB\_gap in specifying the RB allocation regions.

Unless otherwise specified, pi/2 BPSK in following A-MPR tables refers
to both variants of pi/2 BPSK referenced in 6.2.2 tables 6.2.2-1.

The emission requirements specified in Table 6.2A.3.1.3-1 also apply for
the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1-1
from the edge of the channel bandwidth.

lower bound P~CMAX\_L,*c*~, and the higher bound P~CMAX\_H,*c*~
specified in clause 6.2.4 shall apply to UE supporting UL MIMO, where

\- P~PowerClass~, ΔP~PowerClass~ and ∆T~C,c~ are specified in clause
6.2D.1;

\- MPR~c~ is specified in clause 6.2D.2;

\- A-MPR~c~ is specified in clause 6.2D.3.

The measured configured maximum output power P~UMAX,*c*~ for serving
cell *c* shall be within the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,*c*~ -- MAX{T~L~, T ~LOW~(P~CMAX\_L,*c*~)} ≤ P~UMAX,*c*~ ≤
P~CMAX\_H,*c*~ + T ~HIGH~(P~CMAX\_H,*c*~)

where T~LOW~(P~CMAX\_L,*c*~) and T~HIGH~(P~CMAX\_H,*c*~) are defined as
the tolerance and applies to P~CMAX\_L,*c*~ and P~CMAX\_H,*c*~
separately, while T~L~ is the absolute value of the lower tolerance in
Table 6.2D.1-1 for the applicable operating band.

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the tolerance is specified in Table 6.2D.4-1. The
requirements shall be met with UL MIMO configurations specified in Table
6.2D.1-2.

The transmit power time mask defines the transient period(s) allowed

\- between transmit OFF power as defined in clause 6.3.2 and transmit ON
power symbols (transmit ON/OFF)

\- between continuous ON-power transmissions with powerchange or RB
hopping is applied.

In case of RB hopping, transition period is shared symmetrically.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 6.5 apply also in
transient periods.

In the following clauses, following definitions apply:

\- A slot or long subslot transmission is a transmission with more than
2 symbols.

\- A short subslot transmission is a transmission with 1 or 2 symbols.

#### 6.3.3.2 General ON/OFF time mask

The general ON/OFF time mask defines the observation period between
transmit OFF and ON power and between transmit ON and OFF power for each
SCS. ON/OFF scenarios include: contiguous, and non-contiguous
transmission, etc

The OFF power measurement period is defined in a duration of at least
one slot excluding any transient periods. The ON power is defined as the
mean power over one slot excluding any transient period.

#### 6.3.3.3 Transmit power time mask for slot and short or long subslot boundaries

The transmit power time mask for slot and a long subslot
transmissionboundaries defines the transient periods allowed between
slot and long subslot PUSCH transmissions. For PUSCH-PUCCH and PUSCH-SRS
transitions and multiplexing the time masks in clause 6.3.3.7 apply.

The transmit power time mask for slot or long subslot and short subslot
transmission boundaries defines the transient periods allowed between
slot or long subslot and short subslot transmissions. The time masks in
clause 6.3.3.8 apply.

The transmit power time mask for short subslot transmissiona boundaries
defines the transient periods allowed between short subslot
transmissions. The time masks in clause 6.3.3.9 apply.

#### 6.3.3.4 PRACH time mask

The PRACH ON power is specified as the mean power over the PRACH
measurement period excluding any transient periods as shown in Figure
6.3.3.4-1. The measurement period for different PRACH preamble format is
specified in Table 6.3.3.4-1.

### 6.3.4 Power control

#### 6.3.4.1 General

The requirements on power control accuracy apply under normal
conditions.

#### 6.3.4.2 Absolute power tolerance

The absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set
its initial output power to a specific value for the first sub-frame (1
ms) at the start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous
transmission with a transmission gap larger than 20 ms. The tolerance
includes the channel estimation error.

The minimum requirement specified in Table 6.3.4.2-1 apply in the power
range bounded by the minimum output power as specified in clause 6.3.1
and the maximum output power as specified in clause 6.2.1.

Table 6.3.4.2-1: Absolute power tolerance

  Conditions   Tolerance
  ------------ -----------
  Normal       ± 9.0 dB

#### 6.3.4.3 Relative power tolerance

The relative power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set
its output power in a target sub-frame (1 ms) relatively to the power of
the most recently transmitted reference sub-frame (1 ms) if the
transmission gap between these sub-frames is less than or equal to 20
ms.

The minimum requirements specified in Table 6.3.4.3-1 apply when the
power of the target and reference sub-frames are within the power range
bounded by the minimum output power as defined in clause 6.3.1 and the
measured P~UMAX~ as defined in clause 6.2.4.

To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes, 2 exceptions are allowed
for each of two test patterns. The test patterns are a monotonically
increasing power sweep and a monotonically decreasing power sweep over a
range bounded by the requirements of minimum power and maximum power
specified in clauses 6.3.1 and 6.2.1, respectively. For those
exceptions, the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ± 6.0 dB in Table
6.3.4.3-1.

6.4 Transmit signal quality
---------------------------

### 6.4.1 Frequency error

The UE basic measurement interval of modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL
slot. The mean value of basic measurements of UE modulated carrier
frequency shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period
of 1 ms of cumulated measurement intervals compared to the carrier
frequency received from the NR Node B.

### 6.4.2 Transmit modulation quality

#### 6.4.2.0 General

Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected
in-channel RF transmissions from the UE. The transmit modulation quality
is specified in terms of:

\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer
coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process

\- Carrier leakage

\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB

All the parameters defined in clause 6.4.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in Annex F.

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrentList* IE (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[7\]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause
6.4.2.2 and 6.4.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard
to the carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the
calculation of transmit modulation quality.

#### 6.4.2.1 Error Vector Magnitude

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called
the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified
in clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined
after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the
mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %.
For CP-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT
as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %.

The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble
sequence for the PRACH and one slot for PUCCH and PUSCH in the time
domain. The EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbol that
contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval, as
defined in clause 6.3.3.

The RMS average of the basic EVM measurements over 10 subframes for the
average EVM case, and over 60 subframes for the reference signal EVM
case, for the different modulation schemes shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.4.2.1-1 for the parameters defined in Table
6.4.2.1-2. For EVM evaluation purposes, all 13 PRACH preamble formats
and all 5 PUCCH formats are considered to have the same EVM requirement
as QPSK modulated.

#### 6.4.2.2 Carrier leakage

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform whose frequency is the
same as the modulated waveform carrier frequency. The measurement
interval is one slot in the time domain.

In the case that uplink sharing, the carrier leakage may have 7.5 kHz
shift with the carrier frequency.

The relative carrier leakage power is a power ratio of the additive
sinusoid waveform and the modulated waveform. The relative carrier
leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.2-1.

  0 dBm ≤ Output power ≤ 10 dBm       -25
  -30 dBm ≤ Output power \< 0 dBm     -20
  -40 dBm ≤ Output power \< -30 dBm   -10

#### 6.4.2.3 In-band emissions

The in-band emission is defined as the average emission across 12
sub-carriers and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the
allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as
the ratio of the UE output power in a non--allocated RB to the UE output
power in an allocated RB.

The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one
slot in the time domain; however, the minimum requirement applies when
the in-band emission measurement is averaged over 10 sub-frames. When
the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing
with SRS, the in-band emissions measurement interval is reduced by one
or more symbols, accordingly.

The average of the basic in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames
shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3-1.

#### 6.4.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

The zero-forcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement
process (as described in Annex F) must meet a spectral flatness
requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid. The EVM equalizer
spectrum flatness is defined in terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple
of the equalizer coefficients (dB) across the allocated uplink block.
The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM.

The peak-to-peak variation of the EVM equalizer coefficients contained
within the frequency range of the uplink allocation shall not exceed the
maximum ripple specified in Table 6.4.2.4-1 for normal conditions. For
uplink allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the
coefficients evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet
the corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional
requirement: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in
Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be larger than 5
dB, and the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range
2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 7 dB
(see Figure 6.4.2.4-1).

The EVM equalizer spectral flatness shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.4.2.4-2 for extreme conditions. For uplink
allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the coefficients
evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet the
corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional
requirement: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in
Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be larger than 6
dB, and the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range
2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 10 dB
(see Figure 6.4.2.4-1).

##### 6.4.2.4.1 Requirements for Pi/2 BPSK modulation

These requirements apply if the IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1 for
power class 3 UE operating in TDD bands n40, n41, n77, n78 and n79 with
Pi/2 BPSK modulation and UE indicates support for UE capability
*powerBoosting-pi2BPSK* and 40 % or less slots in radio frame are used
for UL transmission. Otherwise the requirements for EVM equalizer
spectrum flatness defined in clause 6.4.2.4 apply.

The EVM equalizer coefficients across the allocated uplink block shall
be modified to fit inside the mask specified in Table 6.4.2.4.1-1 for
normal conditions, prior to the calculation of EVM. The limiting mask
shall be placed to minimize the change in equalizer coefficients in a
sum of squares sense.

6.4D Transmit signal quality for UL MIMO
----------------------------------------

### 6.4D.0 General

For a UE supporting UL MIMO, the requirements in this section are
defined per layer or as the sum of emissions from both antennas to
account for the UL MIMO scheme.

Alternatively, when applicable, requirements may be verified per antenna
connector using an UL MIMO transmission with codebook
of![](./media/image1.wmf){width="0.6638888888888889in"
height="0.42430555555555555in"} and a configuration defined in Table
6.4D.0-1.

Table 6.4D.0-1: UL MIMO configuration for per connector measurements

  ----------------------- ----------------- ------------------
  Transmission scheme     DCI format        Codebook Index
  Codebook based uplink   DCI format 0\_1   Codebook index 0
  ----------------------- ----------------- ------------------

### 6.4D.1 Frequency error for UL MIMO

For UE(s) supporting UL MIMO, the basic measurement interval of
modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL slot. The mean value of basic
measurements of UE modulated carrier frequency per layer shall be
accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period of 1 ms of cumulated
measurement intervals compared to the carrier frequency received from
the NR Node B.

### 6.4D.2 Transmit modulation quality for UL MIMO

#### 6.4D.2.0 General

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality requirements
are specified based on measurements made at each transmit antenna
connector.

If UE is configured for transmission on single-antenna port, the
requirements specified for single carrier apply.

The transmit modulation quality is specified in terms of:

\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer
coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process

\- Carrier leakage (caused by IQ offset)

\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrentList* IE (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[7\]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause
6.4D.2.2 and 6.4D.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard
to the carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the
calculation of transmit modulation quality.

#### 6.4D.2.1 Error Vector Magnitude

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the Error Vector Magnitude requirements specified
in clause 6.4.2.1 apply per layer. The requirements shall be met with
the UL MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2

#### 6.4D.2.2 Carrier leakage

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the Relative Carrier Leakage Power requirements
specified in Table 6.4.2.2-1 which is defined in clause 6.4.2.2 apply
per layer. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations
specified in Table 6.2D.1-2.

#### 6.4D.2.3 In-band emissions

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the In-band Emission requirements specified in
Table 6.4.2.3-1 which is defined in clause 6.4.2.3 apply at each
transmit antenna connector. The requirements shall be met with the
uplink MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2

#### 6.4D.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness for UL MIMO

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the EVM Equalizer Spectrum Flatness requirements
specified in clause 6.4.2.4 apply per layer. The requirements shall be
met with the UL MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2

### 6.4D.3 Time alignment error for UL MIMO

For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna connectors supporting UL MIMO,
this requirement applies to frame timing differences between
transmissions on multiple transmit antenna connectors in the closed-loop
spatial multiplexing scheme.

The time alignment error (TAE) is defined as the average frame timing
difference between any two transmissions on different transmit antenna
connectors.

For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the Time Alignment
Error (TAE) shall not exceed 130 ns.

### 6.4D.4 Requirements for coherent UL MIMO

For coherent UL MIMO, Table 6.4D.4-1 lists the maximum allowable
difference between the measured relative power and phase errors between
different antenna connectors in any slot within the specified time
window from the last transmitted SRS on the same antenna connectors, for
the purpose of uplink transmission (codebook or non-codebook usage) and
those measured at that last SRS. The requirements in Table 6.4D.4-1
apply when the UL transmission power at each antenna connector is larger
than 0 dBm for SRS transmission and for the duration of time window.

Table 6.4D.4-1: Maximum allowable difference of relative phase and power
errors in a given slot compared to those measured at last SRS
transmitted

  Difference of relative phase error   Difference of relative power error   Time window
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ -------------
  40 degrees                           4 dB                                 20 msec

The above requirements when all the following conditions are met within
the specified time window:

\- UE is not signaled with a change in number of SRS ports in
SRS-config, or a change in PUSCH-config

\- UE remains in DRX active time (UE does not enter DRX OFF time)

\- No measurement gap occurs

\- No instance of SRS transmission with the usage antenna switching
occurs

\- Active BWP remains the same

\- EN-DC and CA configuration is not changed for the UE (UE is not
configured or de-configured with PSCell or SCell(s))

6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
--------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth

Occupied bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth containing 99 % of the
total integrated mean power of the transmitted spectrum on the assigned
channel. The occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations (Resources Blocks) shall be less than the channel
bandwidth specified in Table 6.5.1-1.

Table 6.5.1-1: Occupied channel bandwidth

                                     NR channel bandwidth

### 6.5.2 Out of band emission

#### 6.5.2.1 General

The Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
assigned channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission
mask and an adjacent channel leakage power ratio.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 6.5.2.2 Spectrum emission mask

The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~)
starting from the ± edge of the assigned NR channel bandwidth. For
frequencies offset greater than Δf~OOB~, the spurious requirements in
clause 6.5.3 are applicable.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in
Table 6.5.2.2-1 for the specified channel bandwidth.

NOTE: As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring

resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.5.2.3.2 Requirements for network signalling value \"NS\_04\"

Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network
to indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a
specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast
message. The additional spectrum emission requirements in NS\_04 are
based on FCC rule 47 CFR 27.53(m)(4).

The n41 SEM transition point from -13 dBm/MHz to -25 dBm/MHz is based on
the emission bandwidth. The emission bandwidth is defined as the width
of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency
and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all
emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power
based on FCC rule 47 CFR 27.53(m)(6). Since the 26-dB emission bandwidth
is implementation dependent, the maximum transmission bandwidth of the
channel bandwidth in MHz (for CP-OFDM, this bandwidth equals N~RB~ \*
SCS \* 12 / 1,000, and for DFT-S-OFDM, this bandwidth equals the maximum
applicable L~CRB~ \* SCS \* 12 / 1,000) contained within the 26 dB
emission bandwidth is used for determining the applicable SEM indicated
by NS\_04 as specified in Table 6.5.2.3.2-1 and Table 6.5.2.3.2-2.

The assigned NR channel power and adjacent NR channel power are measured
with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in
Table 6.5.2.4.1-1.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than --50 dBm then the
NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5.2.4.1-2.

the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent(s) UTRA channel
frequency.

UTRA~ACLR~ is specified for the first adjacent UTRA channel
(UTRA~ACLR1~) which center frequency is ± 2.5 MHz from NR channel edge
and for the 2^nd^ adjacent UTRA channel (UTRA~ACLR2~) which center
frequency is ± 7.5 MHz from NR channel edge.

The UTRA channel power is measured with a RRC filter with roll-off
factor α = 0.22 and bandwidth of 3.84 MHz. The assigned NR channel power
is measured with a rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth
specified in Table 6.5.2.4.1-1.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than -- 50 dBm then
the UTRA~ACLR1~ and UTRA~ACLR2~ shall be higher than the value specified

### 6.5.3 Spurious emissions

#### 6.5.3.0 General

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions unless otherwise stated. The spurious emission
limits are specified in terms of general requirements in line with
SM.329 \[9\] and NR operating band requirement to address UE
co-existence.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

#### 6.5.3.1 General spurious emissions

Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1-1 from
the edge of the channel bandwidth. The spurious emission limits in Table
6.5.3.1-2 apply for all transmitter band configurations (N~RB~) and
channel bandwidths.

### 6.5.4 Transmit intermodulation

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non
linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

UE transmit intermodulation is defined by the ratio of the mean power of
the wanted signal to the mean power of the intermodulation product when
an interfering CW signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at
each transmitter antenna port with the other antenna port(s) if any
terminated. Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product
power are measured through NR rectangular filter with measurement
bandwidth shown in Table 6.5.4-1.

The requirement of transmit intermodulation is specified in Table
6.5.4-1.

6.5A Output RF spectrum emissions for CA
----------------------------------------

### 6.5A.0 General

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the output RF spectrum emissions requirements in clause 6.5
apply.

### 6.5A.1 Occupied bandwidth for CA

#### 6.5A.1.1 Void

#### 6.5A.1.2 Void

#### 6.5A.1.3 Occupied bandwidth for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the occupied bandwidth is defined per component carrier. Occupied
bandwidth is the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total integrated mean
power of the transmitted spectrum on assigned channel bandwidth on the
component carrier. The occupied bandwidth shall be less than the channel
bandwidth specified in Table 6.5.1-1.

### 6.5A.2 Out of band emission for CA

#### 6.5A.2.1 General

This clause contains requirements for out of band emissions for UE
configured of carrier aggregation.

#### 6.5A.2.2 Spectrum emission mask

##### 6.5A.2.2.1 Void

##### 6.5A.2.2.2 Void

##### 6.5A.2.2.3 Spectrum emission mask for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the spectrum emission mask of the UE is defined per component carrier
while both component carriers are active and the requirements are
specified in clauses 6.5.2.1 and 6.5.2.2. If for some frequency spectrum
emission masks of component carriers overlap then spectrum emission mask
allowing higher power spectral density applies for that frequency. If
for some frequency a component carrier spectrum emission mask overlaps
with the channel bandwidth of another component carrier, then the
emission mask does not apply for that frequency.

#### 6.5A.2.3 Additional spectrum emission mask

##### 6.5A.2.3.1 Void

##### 6.5A.2.3.2 Void

##### 6.5A.2.3.3 Additional spectrum emission mask for Inter-band CA

#### 6.5A.2.4 Adjacent channel leakage ratio

##### 6.5A.2.4.1 NR ACLR

###### 6.5A.2.4.1.1 Void

###### 6.5A.2.4.1.2 Void

###### 6.5A.2.4.1.3 NR ACLR for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NRACLR) is defined per
component carrier while both component carriers are active and the
requirement is specified in clause 6.5.2.4.1.

##### 6.5A.2.4.2 UTRA ACLR

###### 6.5A.2.4.2.1 Void

###### 6.5A.2.4.2.2 Void

###### 6.5A.2.4.2.3 UTRA ACLR for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (UTRAACLR) is defined per
component carrier while both component carrier are active and the
requirement is specified in clause 6.5.2.4.2.

### 6.5A.3 Spurious emission for CA

#### 6.5A.3.1 General spurious emissions

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the spurious emission requirement Table 6.5.3.1-2 apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ as defined in Table 6.5.3.1-1
away from edges of the assigned channel bandwidth on a component
carrier. If for some frequency a spurious emission requirement of
individual component carrier overlaps with the spectrum emission mask or
channel bandwidth of another component carrier then it does not apply.

NOTE: For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR
bands the requirements in Table 6.5.3.1-2 could be verified by measuring
spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where second and third
order intermodulation products generated by the two transmitted carriers
can occur; in that case, the requirements for remaining applicable
frequencies in Table 6.5.3.1-2 would be considered to be verified by the
measurements verifying the one uplink inter-band CA spurious emission
requirement.

#### 6.5A.3.2 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence

##### 6.5A.3.2.1 Void

##### 6.5A.3.2.2 Void

##### 6.5A.3.2.3 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence for Inter-band CA

This clause specifies the additional requirements for inter-band uplink
carrier aggregation configurations with the single CC uplink assigned to
two NR bands for coexistence with protected bands for the specified
uplink carrier aggregation configurations in Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1. The
intersection of the requirements for the individual bands specified in
clause 6.5.3.2 shall also apply for the specified uplink carrier
aggregation configurations. Intersection of a requirement means that
both UL constituent bands have the same protected band requirement
specified and if one or both protected bands have note(s) associated
those note(s) also apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink assigned to two NR
bands, the requirements in Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1 apply on each component
carrier with all component carriers are active.

NOTE: For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR
bands the requirements in Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1 could be verified by
measuring spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where second
and third order intermodulation products generated by the two
transmitted carriers can occur; in that case, the requirements for
remaining applicable frequencies in Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1 would be
considered to be verified by the measurements verifying the one uplink
inter-band CA UE to UE co-existence requirements.

NOTE: To simplify Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1, E-UTRA band numbers are listed for
bands which are specified only for E-UTRA operation or both E-UTRA and
NR operation. NR band numbers are listed for bands which are specified
only for NR operation.

### 6.5A.4 Transmit intermodulation for CA

#### 6.5A.4.1 Void

#### 6.5A.4.2 Void

#### 6.5A.4.3 Transmit intermodulation for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the transmit intermodulation requirement is specified in Table 6.5.4-1
which shall apply on each component carrier with both component carriers
active.

6.5D Output RF spectrum emissions for UL MIMO
---------------------------------------------

### 6.5D.1 Occupied bandwidth for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the requirements for occupied bandwidth apply
to the sum of the powers from both UE transmit antenna connectors The
occupied bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth containing 99 % of the
total integrated mean power of the transmitted spectrum on the assigned
channel.

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the occupied bandwidth at each transmitter antenna
shall be less than the channel bandwidth specified in table 6.5.1-1. The
requirements shall be met with UL MIMO configurations described in
clause 6.2D.1.

If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 for single antenna port codebook based
transmission, the requirements in clause 6.5.1 apply.

### 6.5D.2 Out of band emission for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the requirements for Out of band emissions
resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitters is defined as the sum of the emissions from both UE
transmit antenna connectors.

For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the requirements in subclause 6.5.2 apply. The
requirements shall be met with UL MIMO configurations described in
clause 6.2D.1.

If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 for single antenna port codebook based
transmission, the requirements in clause 6.5.2 apply.

### 6.5D.3 Spurious emission for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the requirements for Spurious emissions which
are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission,
parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion
products are defined as the sum of the emissions from both UE transmit
transmit antenna connectors.

For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the requirements specified in subclause 6.5.3
apply. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations
described in clause 6.2D.1.

If UE is configured for transmission on single-antenna port, the
requirements in clause 6.5.3 apply.

### 6.5D.4 Transmit intermodulation for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit intermodulation requirements are
specified at each transmit antenna connector and the wanted signal is
defined as the sum of output powers from both transmit antenna
connector.

For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the requirements specified in clause 6.5.4 apply to
each transmit antenna connector. The requirements shall be met with the
UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1.

If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 for single antenna port codebook based
transmission, the requirements in clause 6.5.4 apply.

 7 Receiver characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at
the antenna connector(s) of the UE. For UE(s) with an integral antenna
only, a reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for each
antenna port(s). UE with an integral antenna(s) may be taken into
account by converting these power levels into field strength
requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one
receiver antenna connector, identical interfering signals shall be
applied to each receiver antenna port if more than one of these is used
(diversity).

The levels of the test signal applied to each of the antenna connectors
shall be as defined in the respective clauses below.

With the exception of clause 7.3, the requirements shall be verified
with the network signalling value NS\_01 configured (Table 6.2.3-1).

All the parameters in clause 7 are defined using the UL reference
measurement channels specified in Annexes A.2.2, the DL reference
measurement channels specified in Annex A.3.2 and using the set-up
specified in Annex C.3.1.

7.2 Diversity characteristics
-----------------------------

The UE is required to be equipped with a minimum of two Rx antenna ports
in all operating bands except for the bands n7, n38, n41, n77, n78, n79
where the UE is required to be equipped with a minimum of four Rx
antenna ports. This requirement applies when the band is used as a
standalone band or as part of a band combination.

For the single carrier REFSENS requirements in Clause 7, the UE shall be
verified with two Rx antenna ports in all supported frequency bands,
additional requirements for four Rx ports shall be verified in operating
bands where the UE is equipped with four Rx antenna ports.

For Rx requirements other than single carrier REFSENS in Clause 7, the
UE shall be verified with four Rx antenna ports and skip two Rx antenna
ports requirements in operating bands where the UE is equipped with four
Rx antenna ports, otherwise, the UE shall be verified with two Rx
antenna ports.

The above rules apply for all clauses with the exception of clause 7.9.

7.3 Reference sensitivity
-------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

In later clauses of Clause 7 where the value of REFSENS is used as a
reference to set the corresponding requirement:

\- when the UE is verified with 2 Rx antenna ports, it shall be verified
against those requirements by applying the REFSENS value in Table
7.3.2-1 with 2 Rx antenna ports tested;

\- when the UE is verified with 4 Rx antenna ports, it shall be verified
against those requirements by applying the resulting REFSENS value
derived from the requirement in Table 7.3.2-2 with 4 Rx antenna ports
tested.

### 7.3.2 Reference sensitivity power level

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2
and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3.2-1 and Table 7.3.2-2.

Unless given by Table 7.3.2-4, the minimum requirements specified in
Tables 7.3.2-1 and 7.3.2-2 shall be verified with the network signalling
value NS\_01 (Table 6.2.3-1) configured.

  ---------------- --------------------------

### 7.3.3 ΔR~IB,c~

For a UE supporting CA, SUL or DC band combination, the minimum
requirement for reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.2-1 shall be
increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B,
7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the
applicable operating bands.

In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL
or DC, and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations
then

\- When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
ΔR~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

\- When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

7.3A Reference sensitivity for CA
---------------------------------

### 7.3A.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel. For operations with 4 Rx
antenna ports, the MSD in the applicable bands shall be increased by the
absolute value of ΔR~IB,4R~ in Table 7.3.2-2 when MSD \> 0.

For reference sensitivity exception test points where the specified
carrier frequency does not correspond to a valid NR-ARFCN, the closest
NR-ARFCN as specified in clause 5.4.2 applies.

### 7.3A.2 Reference sensitivity power level for CA

#### 7.3A.2.1 Reference sensitivity power level for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the throughput of each
component carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.2.3.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3.2-1, Table 7.3.2-2, and Table 7.3.2-3.

#### 7.3A.2.2 Void

#### 7.3A.2.3 Reference sensitivity power level for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band the throughput
shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described
in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 with parameters specified in Table 7.3.2-1,
Table 7.3.2-2 and Table 7.3.2-3 modified in accordance with clause
7.3A.3.2. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all
downlink component carriers active and one of the uplink carriers
active. Exceptions to reference sensitivity are allowed in accordance
with clause 7.3A.4.

#### 7.3A.2.4 Void

### 7.3A.3 ΔR~IB,c~ for CA

#### 7.3A.3.1 General

For a UE supporting a CA configuration, the ΔR~IB,c~ applies for both SC
and CA operation.

#### 7.3A.3.2 ΔR~IB,c~ for Inter-band CA

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation, the minimum
requirement for reference sensitivity in clause 7.3A.2 shall be
increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ defined in clause 7.3A.3.2 for
the applicable operating bands. Unless otherwise stated, ΔR~IB,c~ is set
to zero.

In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL
or DC, and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations
then

\- When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
ΔR~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

\- When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

### 7.3A.5 Reference sensitivity exceptions due to intermodulation interference due to 2UL CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands
given in Table 7.3A.5-1 the reference sensitivity is defined only for
the specific uplink and downlink test points specified in Table
7.3A.5-1. For these test points the reference sensitivity requirement
specified in Table 7.3.2-1 and Table 7.3.2-2 are relaxed by the amount
of the corresponding parameter MSD given in Table 7.3A.5-1.

### 7.3A.6 Reference sensitivity exceptions due to cross band isolation for CA

Sensitivity degradation is allowed for a band if it is impacted by UL of
another band part of the same NR CA configuration due to cross band
isolation issues. Reference sensitivity exceptions for the victim band
are specified in Table 7.3A.6-1 with uplink configuration of the
agressor band specified in Table 7.3A.6-2.

7.3C Reference sensitivity for SUL
----------------------------------

### 7.3C.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.3C.2 Reference sensitivity power level for SUL

For SUL operation, the reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS)
requirement for downlink bands specified in Table 7.3.2-1 and Table
7.3.2-2 shall be met for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or
equal to that specified in Table 7.3.2-3 or supplementary uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in Table
7.3C.2-1 with reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.2.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1), unless
sensitivity degradation is allowed in this clause of this specification.
These exceptions also apply to any higher order CA or DC combination
containing one of the exception combinations in this clause as subset.

For the UE that supports any of the SUL operation given in Table
7.3C.2-2, exceptions to the requirements specified in Table 7.3.2-1are
allowed when the uplink is active in a lower frequency band and is
within a specified frequency range such that transmitter harmonics fall
within the downlink transmission bandwidth assigned in a higher band as
noted in Table 7.3C.2-2. For these exceptions, the UE shall meet the
requirements specified in Table 7.3C.2-2 and Table 7.3C.2-3.

### 7.3C.3 ΔR~IB,c~ for SUL

#### 7.3C.3.1 General

For a UE supporting a SUL configuration, the ΔR~IB,c~ applies for both
SC and SUL operation.

#### 7.3C.3.2 SUL band combination

For the UE which supports SUL band combiantion, the minimum requirement
for reference sensitivity in clause 7.3C.2 shall be increased by the
amount given in ΔR~IB,c~ defined in clause 7.3C.3.2 for the applicable
operating bands. Unless otherwise stated, ΔR~IB,c~ is set to zero.

In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL
or DC, and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations
then

\- When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
ΔR~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

\- When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

##### 7.3C.3.2.1 ΔR~IB,c~ for two bands

7.3D Reference sensitivity for UL MIMO
--------------------------------------

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.3
shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1
and the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2 for
CP-OFDM waveforms shall apply. For UL MIMO, the parameter P~UMAX~ is the
total transmitter power over the two transmits power over the two
transmit antenna connectors.

7.4 Maximum input level
-----------------------

Maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the
UE antenna port, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet
or exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference

### 7.4A.2 Void

### 7.4A.3 Maximum input level for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the maximum input
level is defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the
band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements
specified in clause 7.4 for each component carrier while all downlink
carriers are active.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexs A.3.2 and A.3.3
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) for each component carrier.

7.4D Maximum input level for UL MIMO
------------------------------------

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.4 shall be
met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1. For UL
MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total transmitter power
over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.5 Adjacent channel selectivity
--------------------------------

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive an NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirements specified in Table 7.5-1
for NR bands with F~DL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz
and the minimum requirements specified in Table 7.5-2 for NR bands with
F~DL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz. These requirements
apply for all values of an adjacent channel interferer up to -25 dBm and
for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.
However, it is not possible to directly measure the ACS; instead the
lower and upper range of test parameters are chosen as in Table 7.5-3
and Table 7.5-4 for verification of the requirements specified in Table
7.5-1, and as in Table 7.5-5 and Table 7.5-6 for verification of the
requirements specified in Table 7.5-2. For these test parameters, the
throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1). For operating bands with an
unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply
for carriers assigned in the paired part.

7.5A Adjacent channel selectivity for CA
----------------------------------------

### 7.5A.1 Adjacent channel selectivity for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall
be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The UE shall fulfil
the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5A.1-1 and 7.5A.1-1a for an
adjacent channel interferer on either side of the aggregated downlink
signal at a specified frequency offset and for an interferer power up to
-25 dBm.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Tables 7.5A.1-2, 7.5A.1-2a, 7.5A.1-3 and 7.5A.1-3a.

### 7.5A.2 Void

### 7.5A.3 Adjacent channel selectivity Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the adjacent
channel requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.5 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.5D Adjacent channel selectivity for UL MIMO
---------------------------------------------

For UE(s) with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.5
shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1.
For UL MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total
transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.6 Blocking characteristics
----------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the spurious response or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted
input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver
beyond a specified limit. The blocking performance shall apply at all
frequencies except those at which a spurious response occurs.

### 7.6.2 In-band blocking

For NR bands with F~DL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz
in-band blocking (IBB) is defined for an unwanted interfering signal
falling into the UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above
the UE receive band. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95 %
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.6.2-1 and Table
7.6.2-2. The relative throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal. For operating
bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the
requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the paired part.

\< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz

For NR bands with F~DL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz
in-band blocking (IBB) is defined for an unwanted interfering signal
falling into the UE receive band or into an immediately adjacent
frequency range up to 3\*BW~Channel~ below or above the UE receive band
where BW~Channel~ is the bandwidth of the wanted signal. The throughput
of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1)\] with parameters
specified in Table 7.6.2-3 and Table 7.6.2-4. The relative throughput
requirement shall be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal.

### 7.6.3 Out-of-band blocking

For NR bands with F~DL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz
out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering
signal falling outside a frequency range 15 MHz below or above the UE
receive band. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with
parameters specified in Table 7.6.3-1 and Table 7.6.3-2. The relative
throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS specified for the
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal. For operating bands with an
unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply
for carriers assigned in the paired part.

For interferer frequencies across ranges 1, 2 and 3 in Table 7.6.3-2, a
maximum of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz
withthe number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth
configuration, BW~Channel~ is the bandwidth of the frequency channel in
MHz and *n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively. For these
exceptions, the requirements in subclause 7.7 apply.

For NR bands with F~DL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz
out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering
signal falling outside a frequency range up to 3\*BW~Channel~ below or
from 3\*BW~Channel~ above the UE receive band, where BW~Channel~ is the
channel bandwidth. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95 %
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.6.3-3 and Table
7.6.3-4. The relative throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.

For interferer frequencies across ranges 1, 2 and 3 in Table 7.6.3-4, a
maximum of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz
withthe number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth
configuration, BW~Channel~ the bandwidth of the frequency channel in MHz
and *n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively. For these
exceptions, the requirements in subclause 7.7 apply.

### 7.6.4 Narrow band blocking

This requirement is measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive a NR
signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an unwanted
narrow band CW interferer at a frequency, which is less than the nominal
channel spacing.

The relative throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.6.4-1. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part
(as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers
assigned in the paired part.

7.6A Blocking characteristics for CA
------------------------------------

### 7.6A.1 General

### 7.6A.2 In-band blocking for CA

#### 7.6A.2.1 In-band blocking for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall
be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The UE shall fulfil
the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.6A.2.1-1 and 7.6A.2.1-1a
for an adjacent channel interferer on either side of the aggregated
downlink signal at a specified frequency offset and for an interferer
power up to -25 dBm. The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

#### 7.6A.2.2 Void

#### 7.6A.2.3 In-band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the in-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.2 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table 7.3A.3.2,
P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.6.2-2 and 7.6.2-4 is increased by
the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

### 7.6A.3 Out-of-band blocking for CA

#### 7.6A.3.1 Out-of-band blocking for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggreagation the downlink SCC(s) shall
be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. For FDD, the PCC
shall be configured closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers
shall be active throughout the test.

The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement in presence of an
interfering signal specified in Tables 7.6A.3-1 and Tables 7.6A.3-2
being on either side of the aggregated signal. The throughput of each
carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

For interferer frequencies across ranges 1, 2 and 3 in Table 7.6A.3-2, a
maximum of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz with
the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth
configuration, BW~Channel~ is the bandwidth of the frequency channel in
MHz and *n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively. For these
exceptions, the requirements in subclause 7.7A.1 apply.

#### 7.6A.3.2 Void

#### 7.6A.3.3 Out-of-band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the out-of-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.3 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with component carriers in operating
bands \< 2.7GHz including n48, and for F~DL\_Low(*j*)~ -- 15 MHz ≤ f ≤
F~DL\_High(*j*)~ + 15 MHz, the appropriate adjacent channel selectivity
and in-band blocking requirements in the respective subclauses 7.5 and
7.6.2 shall be applied for carrier *j*. For inter-band carrier
aggregation with component carriers in operating bands \> 2.7GHz
excluding n48, and for F~DL\_Low(*j*)~ -- 3\*BW~channel~ ≤ f ≤
F~DL\_High(*j*)~ + 3\* BW~channel~, the appropriate adjacent channel
selectivity and in-band blocking requirements in the respective
subclauses 7.5 and 7.6.2 shall be applied for carrier *j*.
F~DL\_Low(*j*)~ and F~DL\_High(*j*)~ denote the respective lower and
upper frequency limits of the operating band containing carrier *j*, *j*
= 1,...,X, with carriers numbered in increasing order of carrier
frequency and X the number of component carriers in the band
combination. BW~channel~ denotes the channel bandwidth of the wanted
signal component carrier j. If CW interferer falls in a gap between
F~DL\_High(*j*)~ and F~DL\_Low(*j*+1)~ where the corresponding OOB
ranges 1 and 2 overlap, then the lower level interferer limit of the
overlapping OOB ranges applies.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the out-of-band blocking requirements specified in clause 7.6.3 shall be
met with the transmitter power for the uplink set to 7 dB below
P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ for each serving cell c.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.6.3-2 and 7.6.3-4
is increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

For inter-band CA combination listed in Table 7.6A.3.3-1, exceptions to

#### 7.6A.4.3 Narrow band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the narrow band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.4 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~UW~ power defined in Table 7.6.4-1 is increased by the
amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1.
For UL MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total
transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.7 Spurious response
---------------------

Spurious response is a measure of the ability of the receiver to receive
a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a
given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering
signal at any other frequency for which a response is obtained, i.e. for
which the out-of-band blocking limit as specified in clause 7.6.3 is not
met.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters for the
wanted signal as specified in Table 7.7-1 for NR bands with F~DL\_high~
\< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and in Table 7.7-1a for NR bands
with F~DL\_high~ ≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_high~ ≥ 3300 MHz and for the
interferer as specified in Table 7.7-2. The relative throughput
requirement shall be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as
noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned
in the paired part.

### 7.7A.2 Void

### 7.7A.3 Spurious response for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the spurious
response are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than
the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the
requirements specified in clause 7.7 for each component carrier while
all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.7-2 is increased by
the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.7D Spurious response for UL MIMO
----------------------------------

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.7
shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1.
For UL MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total
transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.8 Intermodulation characteristics
-----------------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in
the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal

### 7.8.2 Wide band Intermodulation

The wide band intermodulation requirement is defined using a CW carrier
and modulated NR signal as interferer 1 and interferer 2 respectively.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.8.2-1 for NR bands with F~DL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and
F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and Table 7.8.2-2 for NR bands with F~DL\_low~ ≥
3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz. The relative throughput requirement
shall be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the
wanted signal. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in
Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the
paired part.

#### 7.8A.2.2 Void

#### 7.8A.2.3 Wide band intermodulation for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the wide band
intermodulation requirements are defined with the uplink active on the
band(s) other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 7.8 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.8.2-1 and 7.8.2-2
is increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.8D Intermodulation characteristics for UL MIMO
------------------------------------------------

For UE(s) with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements in clause 7.8 shall be met
with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1. For UL MIMO,
the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total transmitter power over
the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.9 Spurious emissions
----------------------

The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the UE antenna connector.

The power of any narrow band CW spurious emission shall not exceed the
maximum level specified in Table 7.9-1
