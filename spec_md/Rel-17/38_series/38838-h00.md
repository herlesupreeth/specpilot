4 Introduction
==============

**[XR Applications]{.underline}**

eXtended Reality[(]{.underline}XR) is a term for different types of
realities and refers to all real-and-virtual combined environments and
human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and
wearables. It includes following representative forms and the areas
interpolated among them.

\- Augmented Reality (AR)

\- Mixed Reality (MR)

\- Virtual Reality (VR)

XR and Cloud Gaming (CG) are currently one of the most important 5G
media applications under consideration in the industry \[2\].

**[System Architecture]{.underline}**

One specific aspect to be considered is the role of Edge Computing as a
network architecture to enable XR and Cloud Gaming. Edge Computing is a
concept that enables cloud computing capabilities and service
environments to be deployed close to the cellular network. It promises
several benefits such as lower latency, higher bandwidth, reduced
backhaul traffic and prospects for several new services as indicated in
the SA6 Study on application architecture for enabling Edge Applications
(TR 23.758). Edge Applications are expected to take advantage of the low
latencies enabled by 5G and the Edge network architecture to reduce the
end-to-end Application-level latencies. Edge Computing is a valuable
enabler which should be considered to help 5G systems achieve the
required performance to enable XR and Cloud Gaming \[2\].

**[Traffic Characteristics]{.underline}**

5G NR is designed to support applications demanding high throughput and
low latency in line with the requirements posed by the support of XR and
Edge Computing applications in NR networks. XR and Edge Computing are
services enabled by Rel-15 NR networks \[2\].

**[Objectives]{.underline}**

The objectives of this study are as follows.

\- Confirm XR and Cloud Gaming applications of interest

\- Identify the traffic model for each application of interest taking
outcome of SA WG4 work as input, including considering different upper
layer assumptions, e.g. rendering latency, codec compression capability
etc.

\- Identify evaluation methodology to assess XR and CG performance along
with identification of KPIs of interest for relevant deployment
scenarios

\- Once traffic model and evaluation methodologies are agreed, carry out
performance evaluations towards characterization of identified KPIs

5 Traffic models
================

In this clause, we provide the DL and UL traffic models for VR, CG, and
AR applications. Since DL/UL traffic models for these applications share
similar characteristics, we first define a generic and parameterized DL
/ UL traffic model, which could be later used in defining VR, CG, AR
applications.

The traffic model defined in this clause is statistical traffic model,
where packet size and packet arrival process are characterized by
certain random variables. The described model is based on the input XR
traffic study from SA4 \[7\]\[3\]\[4\].

5.1 Generic DL traffic model
----------------------------

### 5.1.1 Single stream DL traffic model

This clause provides a parameterized generic single stream DL traffic
model. In this model, as shown in Figure 5.1-1, the XR DL traffic is
modelled as a sequence of video frames arriving at gNB according to the
considered video frame rates and random jitter. The size of each frame
is also random according to a certain distribution.

#### 5.1.1.1 Packet Size

In this model, a packet models the set of IP packets belong to the same
video frame. The video frame includes both left and right eye frame
sharing the same buffer, which is referred to as \'single stream for
dual eye buffer\' or \'single eye buffer\' throughout this document.

The size of a packet is determined by the given data rates and frame
rates, which is modelled as a random variable following truncated
Gaussian distribution with following statistical parameters.

+-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+

Exploration to other distributions for packet size are left up to each
company and could be reported with the modelling details.

#### 5.1.1.2 Packet arrival

In this model, the packet arrival rate is determined by the frame
generation rate, e.g., 60fps. Accordingly, the average packet arrival
periodicity is given by the inverse of the frame rate, e.g., 16.6667ms =
1/60fps. The periodic arrival without jitter gives the arrival time at
gNB for packet with index k (=1,2,3....) as

k/F\*1000 \[ms\],

where F is the given frame generation rates (per second).

Note that this periodic packet arrival implicitly assumes fixed delay
contributed from network side including fixed video encoding time, fixed
network transfer delay, etc.

However, in a real system, the varying frame encoding delay and network
transfer time introduces **jitter** in packet arrival time at gNB which.
In this model, the jitter is modelled as a random variable added on top
of periodic arrivals. The jitter follows truncated Gaussian distribution
with following statistical parameters shown in Table 5.1-2.

Table 5.1.1.2-1: Statistical parameters for jitter

  Parameter          unit   Baseline value for evaluation   Optional value for evaluation
  ------------------ ------ ------------------------------- -------------------------------
  Mean               ms     0                               
  STD                ms     2                               
  Truncation range   ms     \[-4, 4\]                       \[-5, 5\]

Note that the given parameter values and considered frame generation
rates (60 or 120 in this model) ensure that packet arrivals are in order
(i.e., arrival time of a next packet is always larger than that of the
previous packet).

Thus, the periodic arrival with jitter gives the arrival time for packet
with index k (=1,2,3....) as

offset + k/F\*1000 + J \[ms\],

where F is the given frame generation rates (per second) and J is a
random variable capturing jitter. Note that actual traffic arrival
timing of traffic for each UE could be shifted by the UE specific
arbitrary *offset*.

#### 5.1.1.3 Packet delay budget

The latency requirement of XR traffic in RAN side (i.e., air interface)
is modelled as packet delay budget (PDB). The PDB is a limited time
budget for a packet to be transmitted over the air from a gNB to a UE.

For a given packet, the delay of the packet incurred in air interface is
measured from the time that the packet arrives at the gNB to the time
that it is successfully transferred to the UE. If the delay is larger
than a given PDB for the packet, then, the packet is said to violate
PDB, otherwise the packet is said to be successfully delivered.

The value of PDB may vary for different applications and traffic types.

#### 5.1.1.4 Packet success rate requirement

The performance requirement in terms of packet success rate is given as
X (%). If packet delivery delay exceed a given PDB, then, the packet is
counted as failure. Following values for packet success rate X are
considered.

Table 5.1.1.4-1: Packet Success Rate Requirement

  Parameter                                                unit   Baseline values for evaluation   Optional values for evaluation
  -------------------------------------------------------- ------ -------------------------------- --------------------------------
  Packet success rate requirement X for DL single stream   \%     99                               95, 99.99, etc.

Note that the Packet error rate (PER) in percentage is given as PER =
100 -- X.

#### 5.1.1.5 Dual eye buffer model

This clause describes optional modification of packet size and frame
rates for separate packet arrival for dual-eye buffer.

In single eye buffer model, the frame for both eyes arrive at the same
time as a single packet. Thus, mean packet size M is given as R×1e6 / F,
where R is frame generation rate in Mbps and F is frame generation rate.

Whereas, in dual eye buffer model of data rate R, the left and right eye
frame arrive separately with a time offset, which makes the arrival
process effectively equivalent to have two times of frame rates and half
mean packet size of that of single eye buffer model. Accordingly, we
have mean packet size M of dual eye buffer model is given as R×1e6 /
(2×F) for dual eye buffer model.

size

### 5.1.2 Multi-streams DL traffic model

This clause provides optional multi-streams model for XR DL traffic.

\- Option 1: I-frame + P-frame

\- Option 1A: slice-based traffic model

\- Option 1B: Group-Of-Picture (GOP) based traffic model

\- Option 2: video + audio/data

\- Option 3: FOV + omnidirectional stream

#### 5.1.2.1 Option 1 (I+P)

For Option 1, two streams (I-stream and P-stream) are modelled according
to Table 5.1-5.

\- Stream 1: I stream

\- Stream 2: P stream

Depending on the video encoding scheme, two additional sub models --
slice based, and Group of Picture (GOP)-based models are defined.

\- Slice-based: In this encoding scheme, a single video frame is divided
into N slices. Out of N, one slice is I slice and remaining N-1 slices
are P slices. N packets (one I and N-1 P) packets corresponds to one
video frame arriving at the same time.

\- GOP-based: In this encoding scheme, a single video frame is either I
frame or P frame. I frame is transmitted every K frames, where K is the
GOP size, i.e., every group of picture. One video frame arrives at a
time as a packet.

requirement for each stream, criteria to be satisfied UE.

6 Deployment scenarios
======================

We consider following three different deployment scenarios for XR.

\- Dense Urban (: In this scenario, XR UEs are in urban area where gNBs
are deployed densely with inter site distance (ISD) of 200m. User
playing cloud gaming (CG), users experiencing VR/AR indoor and outdoor
are considered. For FR1, 80/20% of UEs are assumed in indoor/outdoor.
For FR2, 100% UEs are assumed to be outdoor.

\- Indoor Hotspot: In this scenario, only indoor XR users are
considered. VR or CG applications is more likely for indoor for work and
gaming. Indoor AR application is also considered. This applies to both
FR1 and FR2.

\- Urban Macro: In this scenario, larger ISD of 500ms is considered,
where XR users are distributed over larger area. Due to large ISD
deployment, XR applications with lower rate would be more relevant to
this scenario. Urban Macro scenario is evaluated for FR1 only.

7 XR capacity evaluation
========================

7.1 Purpose of study
--------------------

In this clause, we describe the KPI for capacity evaluations and provide
evaluation results for capacity based on baseline parameters and
optional parameters/modelling methods.

The purpose of capacity study is to understand the performance of NR
systems for XR applications, and identify any issues and performance
gaps, which could be useful for understanding the limitation of current
NR systems in supporting XR applications and the potential directions
for future necessary enhancements to better support XR.

7.2 KPI
-------

### 7.2.1 UE satisfaction

A UE is declared as a **satisfied UE** if **all** the considered streams
meet their own PER and PDB requirements, i.e., more than a certain
percentage of packets are successfully transmitted within a given air
interface PDB. Specifically, we have followings depending on the
evaluation directions considered.

\- In DL-only evaluation, only DL streams are considered when
identifying UE satisfaction.

\- In UL-only evaluation, only UL streams are considered when
identifying UE satisfaction**.**

### 7.2.2 System capacity

System capacity is identified as KPI for capacity study, which is
defined as the maximum number of users per cell with at least Y % of UEs
being satisfied.

\- Y=90 (baseline) or 95 (optional)

\- Other values of Y can also be evaluated optionally.

For details on how to evaluate capacity, see capacity evaluation clause
7.

7.3 Capacity results
--------------------

This clause is to capture the evaluation results and the corresponding
observations for capacity. The detailed evaluation results can be found
in Annex B.

### 7.3.1 Capacity baseline performance

#### 7.3.1.1 FR1 DL

This clause captures the capacity baseline performance evaluation
results of FR1 DL.

### 7.3.3 Potential capacity enhancements

There have been no RAN1 discussion on aligning the implementation
details of the proposed enhancement schemes presented in this clause, or
aligning the evaluation methodologies to comprehensively model them. The
simulation results presented in this clause are primarily results from
individual sources that may have certain discrepancies in the details of
the proposed enhancement schemes and/or additional assumptions made for
evaluation purposes.

#### 7.3.3.1 Staggering of packet arrivals at gNB among UEs

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
staggering packet arrival time among UEs.

Compared to the case that all UEs have the same packet arrival time
(Zero offset), the capacity performance is evaluated when the packet
arrival times of UEs are evenly spaced within the multimedia periodicity
(Equal offset). Meanwhile, the capacity performance is also evaluated
when the packet arrival time of UEs is random (Random offset).

a\) Random offset: the packet arrival times of UEs are randomly
generated.

b\) Equal offset: the Traffic arrival offset among different UEs are
equal or the same, which means that the packet arrival times of UEs are
evenly spaced within the multimedia periodicity, i.e. (Evenly Spaced).

c\) Zero offset: the interval of packet arrival among UEs are zero,
i.e., all UEs have the same packet arrival time (All synchronized).

#### 7.3.3.4 Cooperative MIMO/precoding via bi-directional training (BiT)

This clause captures the capacity evaluation results of bi-directional
training (BiT) precoding relative to zero-forcing precoding for XR
applications.

Bi-directional Training (BiT) is a spatial-domain interference avoidance
scheme in a TDD Cooperative MIMO system. In BiT, DL interference probing
is performed on uplink sounding resources semi-statically coordinated
among gNBs. On the sounding resources, each gNB triggers SRS
transmissions with parameters associated with corresponding DL
transmissions. Then DL interference mitigation in spatial domain is
performed by each gNB for its DL transmissions based on the interference
probing outcome.

#### 7.3.3.5 Network coding (NC)/outer coding (OC)

This clause captures the capacity evaluation results of network/outer
coding for XR applications. The network/outer coding scheme is based on
introducing the NC/OC sublayer below PDCP. PDCP packets are segmented
into a suitable number of sub-packets, network encoded with desirable
redundancy, and handed to RLC, MAC, and PHY layer for OTA transmission.
The placement for NC/OC sublayer is as a part of the RLC layer. In
network/outer coding scheme provides additional redundancy reducing the
overall latency of packet transmission by reducing HARQ retransmissions.

#### 7.3.3.6 gNB scheduling awareness UE playout buffer

This clause captures the evaluation results of gNB Scheduling Awareness
UE Playout Buffer. The XR application layer at UE would have the XR
packet playout buffer to battle the delay jitter and out-of sequence XR
packet arrival. The playout buffer at UE would ensure the in-sequence
and time interval alignment of XR video frames when it plays out to the
user. The proposed scheme is for UE to feedback not only the
XR-application type (XR-application awareness) but also the implemented
playout buffer at application layer to the gNB. In the evaluation, the
size of playout buffer is feedback from UE and known at gNB. Then, gNB
can have additional PDB, which could give gNB more time to schedule UE
within the delay budget requirements of the XR service and more likely
to successfully transmit packets with link adaptation gain. gNB knowing
the size of playout buffer can preferentially schedule UE with packet
delay close to deadline and better channel conditions.

awareness UE playout buffer can be summarized as follows.

#### 7.3.3.9 Adaptive inter-UE/intra-UE multiplexing techniques

This clause describes the capacity performance with adaptive
inter-UE/intra-UE multiplexing technique. In the evaluation, enhanced
preemption mechanism with finer granularity preemption area indication
is evaluated. For simulation of XR traffic and uRLLC traffic, uRLLC
traffic and XR traffic are considered as the two types of traffic to be
transmitted in the system, where uRLLC traffic has higher priority (HP)
while XR traffic has a relatively low priority (LP). In simulation of
audio/data + video multi stream traffic model, audio/data streams and
video streams are also considered as the two types of streams to be
transmitted in the system, where audio/data streams have higher priority
while video streams have a relatively low priority. Besides, in
simulation of sliced-based multi stream traffic model and single stream
video traffic model, I-slices, P-slices and video streams are considered
as the three types of streams to be transmitted in the system, where
I-slices streams have higher priority while video streams and P-slices
have a relatively low priority.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 7.3.3.9-1, the following
observations can be made.

\- For FR1, Indoor hotspot, DL, with coexistence between uRLLC service
and XR service, with VR/AR single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 60FPS,
10ms PDB, with DDDSU, MU-MIMO, it is observed from Source 20 that the
capacity performance is increased from 8.5 UEs per cell with no
preemption indication to 11.8 UEs per cell with Rel-15 Preemption by
38.8%.

\- For FR1, Indoor hotspot, DL, with coexistence between uRLLC service
and XR service, with VR/AR single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 60FPS,
10ms PDB, with DDDSU, MU-MIMO, it is observed from Source 20 that the
capacity performance is increased from 8.5 UEs per cell with no
preemption indication to 16.6 UEs per cell with enhanced Preemption by
95.3%.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 7.3.3.9-2, the following
observations can be made.

\- For FR1, Indoor Hotspot, DL, with Audio/data + video multi stream
traffic model, with \[PER\_audio, PER\_video\] = \[0.1%, 1%\], 1.12Mbps,
100FPS + 30Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms PDB, with DDDSU, MU-MIMO, with PF
scheduler, it is observed from Source 20 that the capacity performance
is increased from 5.7 UEs per cell with Rel-15 preemption to 8.4 UEs per
cell with enhanced preemption by 47.37%.

\- For FR1, Indoor Hotspot, DL, with Audio/data + video multi stream
traffic model, with \[PER\_audio, PER\_video\] = \[0.1%, 1%\], 1.12Mbps,
100FPS + 30Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms PDB, with DDDSU, MU-MIMO, with PF
scheduler, it is observed from Source 20 that the capacity performance
is increased from 4.9 UEs per cell without preemption to 8.4 UEs per
cell with enhanced preemption by 71.43%.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 7.3.3.9-3, the following
observations can be made.

\- For FR1, Indoor Hotspot, DL, with VR/AR slice-based multi stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms PDB with \[PER\_I, PER\_P\] = \[1%,
1%\] and VR/AR single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms, with
DDDSU, MU-MIMO, with PF scheduler, it is observed from Source 20 that
the capacity performance is increased from 7.1 UEs per cell without
preemption to 10.2 UEs per cell with enhanced preemption by 43.66%.

\- For FR1, Indoor Hotspot, DL, with VR/AR slice-based multi stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms PDB with \[PER\_I, PER\_P\] = \[1%,
1%\] and VR/AR single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms, with
DDDSU, MU-MIMO, with PF scheduler, it is observed from Source 20 that
the capacity performance is increased from 4.5 UEs per cell without
preemption to 10.2 UEs per cell with enhanced preemption by 126.67%.

#### 7.3.3.10 HARQ-ACK enhancement for DG scheduling

This clause describes the capacity performance with HARQ-ACK enhancement
for DG scheduling. In the evaluation, soft HARQ-ACK is used, where the
UE provides enhanced HARQ-ACK feedback beyond the baseline single bit
ACK/NACK status in the form of a Delta MCS based on PDSCH decoding. This
additional information provided by the UE based on reception of a
transport block is used for gNodeB to adapt the scheduling of
retransmissions.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 7.3.3.10-1, the following
observation can be made.

\- For FR1, Dense Urban, DL, with VR/AR, single-stream traffic model,
60Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms PDB, with DDDSU, MU-MIMO, it is observed from Source
16 that the capacity performances are increased from 0/0/0 UEs per cell
with baseline HARQ-Ack (gNodeB processing delay from HARQ feedback to
retransmission = 4/6/8 slots) to 4.6/2.8/2 UEs per cell with Soft
HARQ-Ack with (gNodeB processing delay from HARQ feedback to
retransmission = 4/6/8 slots).

Based on the evaluation results in Table 7.3.3.10-2, the following
observation can be made.

\- For FR1, Indoor hotspot, DL, with VR/AR, single-stream traffic model,
60Mbps, 60FPS, 10ms PDB, with DDDSU, MU-MIMO, it is observed from Source
16 that the capacity performances are increased from 0/0/0 UEs per cell
with baseline HARQ-Ack (gNodeB processing delay from HARQ feedback to
retransmission = 4/6/8 slots) to 2.93/2.1/1.17 UEs per cell with Soft
HARQ-Ack with (gNodeB processing delay from HARQ feedback to
retransmission = 4/6/8 slots).

#### 7.3.3.12 Application data unit (ADU) dropping

This clause describes the capacity performance with Application Data
Unit (ADU) dropping. In the evaluation, for ADU dropping all PDCP
packets belonging to a single ADU frame are dropped after any of them
have passed the PDB limit. The performance is compared with the legacy
case where PDCP packet discarding is enabled, i.e. dropping PDCP packets
after they have passed the PDB limit.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 7.3.3.12-1, the following
observations can be made.

\- For FR1, Dense Urban, DL, with VR/AR, single-stream traffic model,

8 XR UE power consumption evaluation
====================================

8.1 Purpose of study
--------------------

The purpose of power study is to understand the NR UE power consumption
performance for XR applications, and identify any issues and performance
gaps, which could be useful for understanding i) the limitation of
current NR systems in supporting XR applications and ii) the potential
directions for future necessary enhancements to improve power
efficiency.

8.2 KPI
-------

The KPI for power evaluation is the UE power consumption, which is UE
specific metric. The detailed method for estimating UE power consumption
is given in evaluation methodology clause.

The power saving gain (PSG) is determined from A: the power consumption
of a power saving scheme and B: the power consumption of baseline
(AlwaysOn) case; PSG = (B-A)/B×100%.

Since UE power saving gain typically comes with the loss in capacity
(i.e., more precisely, the loss in the satisfied UE ratio), it also
needs to be considered jointly with power consumption/power saving gain.

8.3 UE power consumption evaluation
-----------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Baseline power evaluation results

This clause includes the baseline power consumption results. PS schemes
considered in this clause includes AlwaysOn, R15/16/17 power saving
schemes such as CDRX, cross slot scheduling and MIMO layer adaptation by
BWP switching, PDCCH monitoring adaptation.

\- AlwaysOn: In this scheme, UE is always available for scheduling
(i.e., no DRX off period). When UE is not receiving/transmitting DL/UL
data, UE is assumed to keep monitoring PDCCH.

\- R15/16 CDRX: Connected mode DRX scheme is assumed. (Note that no R16
wake up signal is considered.)

\- Cross slot scheduling and MIMO layer adaptation by BWP switching: R16
dynamic BWP switching across different BWP with different configuration
of minimum K0 and maximum MIMO layers.

\- R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation: UE skipping PDCCH monitoring based
on a dynamically indicated PDCCH skipping indication and/or search space
set group switching (SSSG) indication. In this scheme, it is assumed
that network will send PDCCH skipping command with skipping duration(s).
Note that, in details, the described operation may or may not be fully
compliant to R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation scheme which is currently
still being discussed in R17 UE PS session as of 107-e.

\- Genie: In this scheme, UE is assumed to be in a sleep state (e.g.,
micro/light/deep sleep as defined in TR38.840) whenever there is neither
DL data reception nor UL transmission.

observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR1, DL+UL joint evaluation, InH, VR30, high load, it is observed
from Source 18, Source 20, Source 16 that the R15/16CDRX with
configurations of (cycle/ODT/IAT) = (10/8/4, 16/14/4, 10/8/4, 8/6/6)
provides the mean power saving gain is 4.19% in the range of 2.33 \~ 6%
with marginal loss in DL+UL UE satisfied rate.

\- In FR1, DL+UL joint evaluation, InH, VR30, high load, it is observed
from Source 18 that the R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation provides the
mean power saving gain is 21.78% with marginal loss in DL+UL UE
satisfied rate.

####### 8.3.1.1.2.1.1 VR/AR

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.1.1.2.1.1-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, DU, VR/AR30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 9, Source 18, Source 10, Source 15, Source 7, Source 16 that
the R15/16CDRX with configurations of (cycle/ODT/IAT) = (10/8/4,
16/14/4, 8/6/6, 8/4/6, 4/2/2, 10/8/2, 10/8/3) scheme provides the mean
power saving gain of 8.45% in the range of 3.03 \~ 21.00% with
*marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

\- The choice of a particular R15/16 CDRX configuration (cycle, on
duration, and inactivity timer) greatly affects the PS gain.

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, DU, VR/AR30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 18 that the R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation scheme provides
the mean power saving gain of 18.86% with *marginal* loss in DL UE
satisfied rate.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.1.1.2.1.2-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, DU, CG30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 9, Source 15, Source 11, Source 7, Source 14 that the
R15/16CDRX scheme with configurations of (cycle/ODT/IAT) = (10/8/4,
16/14/4, 4/2/2, 8/4/4, 10/8/2, 16/12/4, 10/8/2, 10/8/3, 10/5/5) provides
the mean power saving gain of 8.4% in the range of 3.3 \~ 20.0% with
*marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

\- The choice of a particular R15/16 CDRX configuration (cycle, on
duration, and inactivity timer) greatly affects the PS gain.

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, DU, CG30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 14 that the R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation scheme provides
the mean power saving gain of 12.86% with *marginal* loss in DL UE
satisfied rate.

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, DU, CG30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 14 that the cross-slot scheduling + MIMO layer adaptation by
BWP switching provides the mean power saving gain of 8.13% with
*marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, DU, CG30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 14 that the cross-slot scheduling + MIMO layer adaptation +
PDCCH skipping by BWP switching provides the mean power saving gain of
8.53% with *marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

####### 8.3.1.1.2.2.1 VR/AR

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.1.1.2.2.1-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, InH, VR/AR30 and high load, it is
observed from Source 18, Source 3, Source 15, Source 11, Source 12,
Source 20 that the R15/16CDRX scheme with configurations of
(cycle/ODT/IAT) = (10/8/4, 16/14/4, 16/12/4, 6/4/2, 10/8/4, 4/2/2,
8/4/4, 10/8/2, 16/8/8, 16/8/4, 16/8/6, 16/10/8, 16/12/8) provides the
mean power saving gain of 9.67% in the range of 2.39 \~ 20.90% with
*marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

\- The choice of a particular R15/16 CDRX configuration (cycle, on
duration, and inactivity timer) greatly affects the PS gain.

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, InH, VR/AR30 and high load, it is
observed from Source 18 that the R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation scheme
provides the mean power saving gain of 20.73% with *marginal* loss in DL
UE satisfied rate.

####### 8.3.1.1.2.2.2 CG

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.1.1.2.2.2-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR1, DL only evaluation, InH, CG30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 20, Source 15, Source 11 that the R15/16CDRX scheme with
configurations of (cycle/ODT/IAT) = (10/8/4, 4/2/2, 8/4/4, 16/8/8,
10/8/2, 10/5/5, 10/8/2) provides the mean power saving gain of 13.11% in
the range of 4.2 \~ 20.90% with *marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

\- The choice of a particular R15/16 CDRX configuration (cycle, on
duration, and inactivity timer) greatly affects the PS gain.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.1.1.3.1.1-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR1, UL only evaluation, DU, VR/CG UL pose (250Hz) and high load,
it is observed from Source 18 that the R15/16CDRX scheme with
configurations of (cycle/ODT/IAT) = (4/2/1, 8/3/1) provides the mean
power saving gain of 31.95% in the range of 26.62 \~ 37.27% with
*marginal* loss in UL UE satisfied rate.

\- In FR1, UL only evaluation, DU, VR/CG UL pose (60Hz) and high load,
it is observed from Source 14 that the R16 cross slot scheduling scheme
provides the mean power saving gain of 20.48% with *marginal* loss in UL
UE satisfied rate.

\- In FR1, UL only evaluation, DU, VR/CG UL pose (60Hz) and high load,
it is observed from Source 14 that the R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation
scheme provides the mean power saving gain of 15.32% with *marginal*
loss in UL UE satisfied rate.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.1.2.2.1.1-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR2, DL only evaluation, DU, VR/AR30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 18 that the R15/16CDRX scheme with configurations of
(cycle/ODT/IAT) = (10/8/4, 16/14/4) provides the mean power saving gain
of 7.73% in the range of 5.96 \~ 9.5% with *marginal* loss in DL UE
satisfied rate.

\- In FR2, DL only evaluation, DU, VR/AR30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 18 that the R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation scheme provides
the mean power saving gain of 31.24% with *marginal* loss in DL UE
satisfied rate.

####### 8.3.1.2.2.2.1 VR/AR

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.1.2.2.2.1-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- In FR2, DL only evaluation, InH, VR/AR30 and high load, it is
observed from Source 18, Source 15, Source 16 that the R15/16CDRX scheme
with configurations of (cycle/ODT/IAT) = (10/8/4, 16/14/4, 4/2/2,
10/8/2) provides the mean power saving gain of 10.78% in the range of
5.81 \~ 19.58% with *marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

\- The choice of a particular R15/16 CDRX configuration (cycle, on
duration, and inactivity timer) greatly affects the PS gain.

\- In FR2, DL only evaluation, DU, VR/AR30 and high load, it is observed
from Source 18 that the R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation scheme provides
the mean power saving gain of 32.69% with *marginal* loss in DL UE
satisfied rate.

### 8.3.2 Performance Comparison for Parameters/Modelling

#### 8.3.2.1 Trade-off between capacity and power

This clause captures the CDRX performance evaluation results showing the
trade-off between capacity (% of satisfied UE) and power consumption.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.2.1-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- It is observed from the Source 10, Source 15, Source 18, Source 9,
Source 7, Source 11 that there is trade-off relation between % of
satisfied UE (or capacity) and power saving gain, that is, in general,
high power saving gain can be achieved with the lower % of satisfied UE
for CDRX schemes.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.2.4-2, the following
observations can be made.

[Observations]{.underline}

\- It was observed from Source 16 that reducing pose periodicity could
decrease power consumption.

\- In FR1, DL+UL evaluation, DU, Pose only, AlwaysOn, it was observed
from Source 16 the pose tx with periodicity of 8ms (or 125Hz) has power
saving gain of 2.27% w.r.t AlwaysOn with periodicity of 4ms.

\- In FR1, DL+UL evaluation, DU, Pose only, AlwaysOn, it was observed
from Source 16 the pose tx with periodicity of 16.67ms (or 60Hz) has
power saving gain of 10.83% w.r.t AlwaysOn with periodicity of 4ms.

### 8.3.3 Potential Enhancements

There have been no RAN1 discussion on aligning the implementation
details of the proposed enhancement schemes presented in this clause, or
aligning the evaluation methodologies to comprehensively model them. The
simulation results presented in this clause are primarily results from
individual sources that may have certain discrepancies in the details of
the proposed enhancement scheme and/or additional assumptions made for
evaluation purposes.

#### 8.3.3.1 Enhanced CDRX

In this clause, we provide performance evaluation results of eCDRX where
eCDRX is a set of enhanced CDRX mechanisms which allow adjusting DRX On
duration start time offset to be aligned with each XR DL traffic arrival
time, or configure a CDRX cycle pattern with different cycle values
instead of only one CDRX cycle, etc.

#### 8.3.3.2 Jitter Handling

This clause provides the performance impact of potential jitter handling
mechanisms.

XR DL traffic arrival has jitter which makes exact frame arrival timing
random due to random delay contributed from frame encoders in Edge
server, network transfer time in core network, etc. If traffic arrives
too early, then packets should be delayed until UE wakes up from CDRX
off state, which increases the latency for the packet transmission. This
can potentially negatively affect the capacity given the tight PDB in
DL. DL burst arrives later than the expected time of arrival (where DRX
On duration start offset is configured), the UE should wait for DL burst
arrival while performing unnecessary PDCCH monitoring. The unnecessary
PDCCH monitoring increases UE power consumption. Jitter handling
mechanisms address these issues. In this clause, following potential
jitter handling schemes have been captured.

\- eCDRX with jitter handling

\- Enhanced PDCCH monitoring adaption with jitter handling

\- Enhanced CDRX with additional active time

\- Fast/dense WUS for jitter handling with eCDRX

The general idea for jitter handling is to make DRX On duration start
offset/PDCCH skipping end duration/new Active Time be aligned with
actual DL traffic arrival time as much as possible by L1 indication or
prediction based on traffic arrival statistics. This power saving gain
captured in this clause show the potential performance gain when jitter
can be properly handled by such schemes.

#### 8.3.3.3 XR dedicated PDCCH monitoring window

In this clause, we capture the evaluation results for dynamic scheduling
of XR specific dedicated PDCCH monitoring window scheme with PDCCH
skipping and go-to-sleep. In this scheme, XR dedicated PDCCH monitoring
window/cycle is defined, which is disassociated with the DRX
configuration, but aligned with XR traffic pattern. Dynamic scheduling
with XR specific dedicated PDCCH monitoring window scheme would have UE
monitor PDCCH in the given window in both within Active time and outside
Active Time when DRX is configured.

#### 8.3.3.4 Additional packet delay budget with playout buffer

This clause captures the evaluation results of the impact of additional
PDB (APDB) on UE power consumption. The XR application layer at UE would
have the XR packet playout buffer to battle the delay jitter and out-of
sequence XR packet arrival. The playout buffer at UE would ensure the
in-sequence and time interval alignment of XR video frames when it plays
out to the user. The proposed scheme is for UE to feedback not only the
XR-application type (XR-application awareness) but also the implemented
playout buffer at application layer to the gNB. If the size of playout
buffer is fed back from UE and known at gNB, then, additional PDB could
be used for packet scheduling, which could give gNB more time to
schedule UE within the delay budget requirements of the XR service and
more likely to successfully transmit packets with link adaptation gain.
The addition of the power saving techniques, such as PDCCH skipping and
go-to-sleep, could help UE in achieving power saving by reducing PDCCH
monitoring during extended scheduling period by additional PDB.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.3.4-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observation]{.underline}

\- In FR1, DL evaluation, DU, VR30, it was observed from Source 3 that
additional packet delay budget with play out buffer provides the mean
power saving gain of 30.42% in the range of 26.43\~34.56% with
*marginal* loss in DL UE satisfied rate.

#### 8.3.3.5 Traffic arrival offset staggering

This clause captures the evaluation results of the impact of different
traffic arrival offsets across different UEs. The XR DL traffic arrival
offsets potentially determines the time UE wakes up and how long the UE
need to be awake. When the frame arrivals are aligned with each other,
the XR traffic of the UEs contend for resources, decreasing the capacity
and increasing power consumption due to the increased UE awake time. If
the frame arrivals of UEs are staggered relative to each other, the cell
can serve UEs minimizing the overlap of scheduling durations of each UE,
which consequently reduce UEs\' awake time and make UEs stay longer in
sleep state.

#### 8.3.3.6 SR group switching

This clause captures the evaluation results of the SR group switching
and baseline. The XR UL traffic arrives frequently, especially for
pose/control. For dynamic scheduling, UE transmits a SR if UE has data
to be transmitted. UE will monitor PDCCH for potential UL grant after
the transmission of SR. Frequent SR transmission will increase both UL
and DL power consumption. Switching between a dense SR periodicity and a
sparse SR periodicity can achieve a tradeoff between latency of UL data
transmission and UE power consumption.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.3.6-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observation]{.underline}

\- In FR1, UL evaluation, InH, ULPose with 250FPS, it was observed from
Source 20 that SR group switching provide the mean power saving gain of
12.1% with respect to UL\_baseline (UE can perform UL transmission at
every UL slot/symbol if needed) with *marginal* loss in UL UE satisfied
rate.

#### 8.3.3.7 UL active time

This clause captures the evaluation results of the UL active time and
baseline. Various signals/data needs to be transmitted in UL. UE needs
to wake up frequently to transmit signals/data which requires more power
for warm-up and ramp-down. The independent transmission occasion of each
signals/data shall also split sleep time of the UE. If the transmission
of UL signals/data can be confined within an UL active time, UE is more
likely to go to a deeper sleep. UL active time is defined by a periodic
cycle and a duration, where UE only transmits UL signals/data during the
duration time of the cycle, and UE doesn\'t transmit UL signals/data
outside the duration of the cycle. In this clause, UL active time with
configurations of (cycle, duration) = (8ms, 4ms), (8ms, 3ms) is
evaluated.

Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.3.7-1, the following
observations can be made.

[Observation]{.underline}

\- In FR1, UL evaluation, InH, UL Pose 250FPS, it was observed from
Source 20 that UL active time provide the mean power saving gain of
16.335% in the range of 13.67 \~19% with respect to UL\_baseline(UE can
perform UL transmission at every UL slot/symbol if needed) with
*marginal* loss in UL UE satisfied rate.

9 XR coverage evaluation 
========================

9.1 Purpose of study
--------------------

The coverage study is for understanding the DL and UL coverage
performance of XR applications. Note that the coverage depends on the
evaluation assumptions/setup such as considered link direction (DL vs
UL), bit rate, PDB, PER requirement, gNB/UE tx power, etc. Thus, the
metric should be understood as a conditional metric for the given
assumption. Through this study, we can identify the coverage of XR
applications in terms of coupling gain and bottleneck direction of the
considered applications.

9.2 KPI
-------

The KPI of the coverage evaluation is *XR coverage* which is defined as
the 5% point of CDF of coupling gains for the satisfied UEs.

In this study, we consider two slightly different evaluation
methodologies. The details of the two coverage evaluation methodologies
are found in Annex A.3.

11 Conclusions
==============

The study focused on the following objectives: (1) confirm XR and Cloud
Gaming (CG) applications of interest, (2) identify the traffic models
for the applications of interest taking outcome of SA WG4 work as input,
(3) identify evaluation methodology and KPIs to assess XR and CG
performance for relevant deployment scenarios, (4) evaluate XR and CG
performance towards characterization of identified KPIs.

Diverse AR, VR, and CG applications were identified and confirmed as the
applications of interest in the study. These applications include, but
not limited to: VR1 (Viewport dependent streaming), VR2 (Split
Rendering: Viewport rendering with Time Warp in device), AR1 (XR
Distributed Computing), AR2 (XR Conversational), and CG.

Traffic models and characteristics of AR, VR, and CG applications were
developed taking into account NR RAN performance evaluations. The
traffic models include single stream downlink (DL) traffic model for
VR/AR/CG, optional multi-stream DL traffic model for VR/AR/CG, single
stream uplink (UL) traffic models for VR/AR/CG, and multi-stream UL
traffic model for AR, as described in Clause 6. A baseline per UE KPI
which considers PER and PDB is identified and used for subsequent
evaluations.

The AR, VR, and CG performance for NR was evaluated using the traffic
models for FR1 and FR2 in various deployment scenarios (indoor hotspot,
dense urban, and urban macro) in terms of capacity, UE power
consumption, coverage and mobility.

**[XR Capacity]{.underline}**

The capacity for AR, VR, and CG applications was evaluated and the
results are summarized as follows:

\- The baseline capacity for AR, VR, and CG in FR1 DL/UL and FR2 DL/UL
were evaluated based on the agreed traffic models, evaluation
methodology, and KPIs, with the results collected in Clause 8.3.1. The
evaluation results show that

\- 5G NR can support AR, VR, and CG for the evaluated cases and
scenarios, where the capacity in urban macro scenario is generally lower
than that in dense urban and indoor hotspot scenarios, in particular for
AR applications with uplink video.

\- The capacity impact of different data-rates, different PDB/PER
(packet delay budget/packet error rate) values, jitter, dual-eye buffer
staggering, different TDD frame formats, different bandwidths, or
FDM/SDM and mini-slot operations have been evaluated. The results and
observations are given in Clause 8.3.2. Based on the evaluation results,
the following is observed:

\- The NR system capacity in support of AR, VR, and CG applications is
smaller for applications requiring higher data rate.

\- The NR system capacity in support of AR, VR, and CG applications is
higher with larger PDB value and/or relaxed PER requirement (i.e.,
higher PER values).

\- The AR, VR, and CG capacity is higher with larger system bandwidth.

\- Various potential NR capacity enhancement schemes in support of XR
services were proposed and evaluated by different companies. Their
results are collected in Clause 7.3.3:

**[XR UE Power Consumption]{.underline}**

The UE power consumption for AR, VR, and CG applications was evaluated
and the results are summarized as follows:

\- The power saving gain from Release 15, 16, and 17 power saving
schemes including CDRX, PDCCH monitoring adaptation, cross slot
scheduling, MIMO layer adaptation was evaluated with respect to the case
when UE is always on, i.e., UE is available for gNB scheduling for all
slots. Corresponding results and observations are given in Clause 9.3.1.

\- The UE power consumption was evaluated for different parameters. The
results are collected in Clause 9.3.2. The following is observed from
the results:

> \- There is a trade-off between UE power saving gain and capacity.
>
> \- The choice of a CDRX configuration (cycle, on duration, and
> inactivity timer) greatly affects the power saving (PS) gain.
>
> \- The AR, VR, and CG capacity is higher with larger system bandwidth.
>
> \- The potential enhancement schemes for UE power saving were proposed
> and evaluated by different companies. Their results and observations
> are given in Clause 8.3.3

**[XR Coverage]{.underline}**

The AR, VR, and CG coverage was evaluated based on the agreed traffic
model and two methodologies for coverage evaluation. Note that these two
methodologies are different from the traditional methodology based on
link budget for coverage evaluation. The results are collected in Clause
10.3.

According to the evaluation results, it is observed that for deployment
scenarios of dense urban and urban macro, UL coverage is worse than DL
coverage.

**[XR Mobility]{.underline}**

The performance of mobility for AR, VR, and CG applications was studied.
The study considers two mobility KPIs given in Clause 11.2: number of
consecutive XR packets lost due to a handover event and minimum target
time between handover events. The evaluation methodology of mobility
performance is a simplified analytical approach given in Clause A.4, and
the evaluation results are collected in Clause 11.3. The following is
observed from the results:

\- Higher PDB leads to lower (better) mobility KPIs.

\- Higher frame rate leads to higher (worse) number of consecutive XR
packets lost:

\- When varying the handover interruption time, the lower (better)
mobility KPIs are achieved when handover interruption time is lower than
PDB.

\- Higher handover interruption time leads to higher (worse) mobility
KPIs.

Based on the study, it is recommended to further study and enhance at
least the capacity and UE power consumption performance of 5G NR for XR
and CG applications.

#########  Annex A: Evaluation methodology

A.1 Evaluation methodology for capacity
=======================================

**[System Level Simulation Parameters for Capacity
Evaluation]{.underline}**

For Capacity evaluation, system level simulation (SLS) is carried out
based on the simulation parameters presented in Table A.1-1 (for FR1)
and Table A-1-2 (for FR2) should be used.

The gNB and UEs in the simulation are configured base on simulation
parameters presented in Table A.1-1 (for FR1) and Table A-1-2 (for FR2)
and the traffic model used for the simulation is selected from the XR/CG
traffic models presented in Clause 5.

**[DL-only and UL-only Evaluation]{.underline}**

In capacity evaluation, the DL and UL evaluation is done separately and
independently.

**[UE Dropping]{.underline}**

For a given number of UEs per cell, *N*, the *N* UEs are randomly
dropped in the network using the UE distribution specified in Table
A.1-1 (for FR1) and Table A-1-2 (for FR2) for the chosen deployment
scenario. Either exactly equal number of UEs per cell could be assumed
or on average N UEs per cell could be assumed. Either approach is
accepted, and companies are to report the method used for their
evaluation.

**[Packet Discarding]{.underline}**

Once communication commence between the UE and gNB, an XR/CG packet is
deemed in error (i.e., lost) when it has exceeded the PDB, such that it
will be added to the PER counting. It is up to company to report the
details for the handling of packet which has exceeded the PDB, e.g.

**- Option 1:** The packet exceeding the delay is still delivered to the
other side

**- Option 2:** The packet (including the non-transmitted part) is
discarded at the transmitter (at the gNB for DL packets and at the UE
for UL packets)

\- Other options are not precluded

**[Satisfied UE and Capacity]{.underline}**

For a given UE, the achieved PER for all packets communicated during the
session is determined. Using the achieved PER per UE, the percentage of
the satisfied UEs can be determined for this simulation.

Multiple runs of the SLS are required to sweep the number of UEs per
cell, *N,* in order to determine the capacity C (i.e., the maximum value
of *N* satisfying at least 90% of the UEs are satisfied (see Clause
7.2.2 for definition of capacity)).

The system capacity for DL and UL are identified separately though
independent evaluation.

**[Additional Metrics]{.underline}**

In addition to the KPIs discussed in Clause 7.2, following performance
metrics can be optionally reported.

\- Percentage of satisfied UEs

\- CDF of packet error ratio

\- CDF of packet latency

\- CDF of user-perceived throughput

\- Resource utilization

A.2 Evaluation methodology for power
====================================

**[Baseline UE Power Model]{.underline}**

For XR UE power evaluation, the power model presented in \[6\] is used
with additional modifications presented in this clause.

**[System Level Power Evaluation]{.underline}**

In this study, UE power consumption evaluation system is done in *system
level* setup; UE are distributed across multiple cells are their dynamic
DL rx and UL tx activities are considered in each UE\'s power
consumption evaluation including time varying channel conditions, and
dynamic scheduling for DL and UL with HARQ operations, power control,
etc. With system level setup, the study allows to capture distribution
of UE power consumptions across different locations in the cell showing
different power consumption distributions across different rx/tx
physical channel activities (e.g., PDCCH, PDSCH, PUSCH, PUCCH, ...).

More importantly, the system level power evaluation allows the joint
evaluation of capacity and power -- allowing to capture the interaction
between scheduler and power saving mechanism (e.g., CDRX) revealing
capacity and power tradeoff. Due to the power of system level power
evaluation framework, one can compare different power saving mechanisms
with capacity in consideration, i.e., making the comparison fair by
making it subject to limited capacity loss.

**[Power Saving Schemes]{.underline}**

To evaluate the power saving impact of different power saving schemes
for XR/CG, companies are encouraged to evaluate UE power consumption as
described below:

As a baseline, UE is always ON, i.e., UE is always available for gNB
scheduling of XR/CG traffic, is considered. The power consumption of
AlwaysOn could be reference for power saving gain calculation.

Optionally following power saving mechanisms can be further considered.

**- Release 15/16 CDRX** mechanism can be optionally evaluated. The CDRX
configuration can be reported with the evaluation results.

**- Release 15/16/17 Connected mode** **power saving techniques** such
as BWP switching, PDCCH skipping and search space switching can also be
evaluated.

**- Genie** scheme can be studied. The Genie power saving scheme works
such that UE is in a sleep state (e.g., micro/light/deep sleep as
defined in TR38.840) whenever there is neither DL data reception nor UL
transmission. From the gNB scheduling perspective, it is assumed that UE
is always available for scheduling, i.e., there is no difference from
Baseline in gNB scheduling and corresponding UE transmission/reception
availability. Note that the Genie approach is expected to provide an
*upper bound of power savings* gain since the UE is able to take
advantage of all the unscheduled slot duration by entering sleep state
whenever possible.

\- Other schemes not listed here could be also evaluated.

**[DL and UL Power Saving Evaluation]{.underline}**

For XR/CG power consumption evaluation, DL and UL power consumption can
be evaluated based on following methods.

**- DL-only Evaluation, UL-only Evaluation:** DL and UL power are
evaluated separately and independently, and the DL and UL power
consumption results are collected separately.

**- DL+UL Joint Evaluation:** DL and UL performances are evaluated
together, and DL and UL power consumption are counted to obtain the
total power consumption.

Note that adding DL-only power number and UL-only power will not give
the equal power number as DL+UL joint power number due to duplicate
power cost counted in DL / UL-only method such as PDCCH monitoring.

**[System-level Simulation Flow]{.underline}**

For XR UE power consumption evaluation, SLS is carried out using the
capacity evaluation methodology for the baseline and power saving scheme
under investigation. The details are presented below:

\- Step 1. Determine a scenario/application/configurations/power saving
schemes for evaluation.

\- Step 2. Determination of the number of UEs per cell N for power
evaluation.

\- N is set to floor(C), where C is the XR capacity for the given
scenario/application/configuration and floor() is flooring operation.

\- Note that N=floor(C) corresponds to the high system load case.

\- Optionally, N could be set to smaller than C (N\<\< C) for low load
case.

\- Step 3. Perform system level power evaluation for the given
scenario/application/configuration and N determined in Step 2)

\- Step 4. Following metrics are reported.

\- satisfied UE rate in capacity evaluation

\- satisfied UE rate in power evaluation

\- PSG CDF 5, 50, 95% points

\- Power saving gain is computed w.r.t to AlwaysOn case.

\- PSG could be computed w.r.t either all UE or satisfied UEs. Companies
report method used with their results.

**[Additional UL Power Modelling]{.underline}**

**One of necessary enhancements of power model for system level power
evaluation is the UL power consumption model.** The UL power model in TR
38.840 is incomplete for the case of UE transmit power other than 0 and
23dBm. The power consumption values corresponding to UE transmit powers
other than 0 dBm and 23 dBm (cell middle UEs) are not defined.
Therefore, to determine the power consumption for such scenarios,
companies are encouraged to use the following methods to estimate UE
power consumptions when transmitting with tx power other than 0 and
23dBm:

Linear interpolation method in linear scale for Tx power values other
than 0 dBm and 23 dBm. Companies are to indicate how they do linear
interpolation method in linear scale considering step-wise linear
average of UE power model.

As another method that can be used for evaluation, consider only two Tx
power values as defined in TR 38.840. Power number is given as *A* for
*X= \[0, M\]*dBm and B for X =\[M, 23\]dBm, where A and B (defined in
38.840) correspond to power consumption numbers for a given uplink slot
for 0dBm and 23dBm respectively with M = \[20\] or other value(s).

**The power consumption of the UE** transmitting with power less than 0
dBm could be set to **the** power number of 0 dBm. Alternatively,
companies could choose to adopt the extrapolation of the power numbers
from on 0 and 23dBm power numbers.

For other missing UL power modelling, companies use their own model and
report with their results.

A.3 Evaluation methodology for coverage
=======================================

For XR/CG Coverage Evaluation, there are two options for evaluating the
coverage based on the coupling gain metric. The coupling gain is defined
as the ratio of received and transmitted power measured in dB, and
includes antenna gains, path loss, shadowing, indoor- or body loss, etc.
For more information about coupling gain, readers are referred to TR
37.910.

Below are the two methodologies:

**[Coverage Evaluation Methodology 1]{.underline}**

For a given XR application (AR/VR/CG) in a given deployment scenario
(DU/InH/UMa), the XR/CG in DL or UL coverage is determined as follows:

\- Run SLS with \#UEs per cell = 1 as shown in Figure A.3-1 and/or XR/CG
capacity using the XR system capacity evaluation methodology presented
in A.1.

\- Determine the \"satisfied UE\" and evaluate coupling gain for those
UEs.

\- The coverage is defined to be the 5-percentile point in CDF of
coupling gain for the \"satisfied\" UEs.

Note**:** For this methodology, the evaluation of coupling gain will be
impacted by e.g., interference and scheduler mechanism, etc.

cell)

**[Coverage Evaluation Methodology 2]{.underline}**

For a given XR application (AR/VR/CG) for a given deployment scenario
(DU/InH/UMa), the XR/CG in DL or UL coverage is determined as follows:

\- Run SLS with \#UEs per cell = 1 as shown in figure A.3-2. The UE is
randomly dropped in the entire network (or in all the cells) that is
associated with one of the three center cells (or gNBs), i.e., only one
of the center gNBs is activated.

\- Run SLS according to capacity evaluation methodology and determine
whether the UE is satisfied or not.

\- The coverage is defined to be the 5-percentile point in the CDF curve
of coupling gain for all the satisfied UEs.

network)

A.4 Evaluation methodology for mobility
=======================================

For XR/CG mobility evaluation, mobility performance is evaluated
analytically while taking into account mobility procedures, traffic
models, and user satisfaction criteria.

The mobility performance metrics {*N, T*}, where *N* is the number of
consecutive XR packets lost due to a HO event and T is the minimum
target time interval between HO events in ms, are obtained by the
following steps:

\- Step1. Calculate HO interruption time in ms (*Y*) for existing HO
techniques by directly following the requirements given in TS 38.133.

\- Step2. For a *Y* and the XR traffic pattern characterized by the
packet arrival rate in average as determined by the frame generation
rate of the flow in fps (*F*) in 6.1.1.2, and the packet delay budget in
ms (*PDB*).

\- *N* is estimated as:

$$N = (Y - PDB) \times \frac{F}{1000}\ \ \ Y \geq PDB$$

\- *T* is estimated as:

$$T = (Y - PDB) \times \frac{100\% - P_{E,op}}{100\% - X - P_{E,op}}\ \ \ Y \geq PDB$$

> where $P_{E,\text{op}}$ is packet error rate during time outside of
> handover procedure and *X* is packet success rate (baseline: *X* =
> 99%, other *X* value(s) can be also evaluated).

\- The case of *Y \< PDB* can be optionally evaluated, e,g.

$$N = 0,\ or\ N = Y \times \frac{F}{1000}\ \ \ \ Y < PDB$$

$$T = 0,\ or\ T = Y \times \frac{100\% - P_{E,op}}{100\% - X - P_{E,op}}\ \ \ \ \ \ Y < PDB$$

Note 1: mobility evaluation is performed in Dense Urban and Urban Macro.

Note 2: *T* maybe affected by system load, interference, etc.
