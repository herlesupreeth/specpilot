10 Measurement Performance requirements
=======================================

10.1 NR measurements
--------------------

### 10.1.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1 apply as follows:

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for PCell measurements in SA,
NR-DC, or NE-DC operaion mode,

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for PSCell measurements in NR-DC
or EN-DC operaion mode,

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for SCell measurements in SA
operation mode with NR CA or any MR-DC operaion mode with NR CA,

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for non-serving cell measurements
on NR carrier frequencies.

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for measurements from one cell on
a frequency compared to the measurement from another cell on a different
frequency.

In the requirements of clause 10.1, the exceptions for side conditions
apply as follows:

\- for the UE capable of CA but not configured with any SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.2.1 for UE supporting CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.3 for UE
supporting CA in FR2, respectively;

\- for the UE capable of CA and configured with at least one SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.2.2 for UE configured with CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.4 for
UE supporting CA in FR2 respectively;

\- for the UE capable of SUL but not configured with SUL, the applicable
exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B, clause B.3.4.1
for UE supporting SUL in FR1;

\- for the UE capable of SUL and configured with at least one SUL, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.4.2 for UE configured with SUL in FR1.

### 10.1.2 Intra-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR1

#### 10.1.2.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.2.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SS-RSRP in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR1. The accuracy requirements in this clause are
also applicable when *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* or
*highSpeedMeasCA-Scell-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1.2.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the SS-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
in FR1. The accuracy requirements in this clause are also applicable
when *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* or *highSpeedMeasCA-Scell-r17* is
configured.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

#### 10.1.2.2 Void

#### 10.1.2.3 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.2.3.1 Absolute CSI-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RSRP in this clause apply to a cell where the CSI-RS resources to be
measured have the same center frequency as the CSI-RS resources
indicated for measurement in the serving cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2.3.1-1.- The timing offset
between the reference measurement timing and the target CSI-RS in one
layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

##### 10.1.2.3.2 Relative CSI-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RSRP is defined as the CSI-RSRP measured
from one cell compared to the CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on the
same center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRP levels measured on
the same cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2.3.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2.3.2-1. - The timing offset
between the reference measurement timing and the target CSI-RS in one
layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

##### 10.1.2C.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the SS-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.2C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[40\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.17 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

### 10.1.3 Intra-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR2

#### 10.1.3.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.3.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SS-RSRP in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.3.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of
TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

#### 10.1.3.2 Void

#### 10.1.3.3 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.3.3.1 Absolute CSI-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RSRP in this clause apply to a cell where the CSI-RS resources to be
measured have the same center frequency as the CSI-RS resources
indicated for measurement in the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.3.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB(s).

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.3.3.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of
TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.3.3.2 Relative CSI-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RSRP is defined as the CSI-RSRP measured
from one cell compared to the CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on the
same center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRP levels measured on
the same cell in FR2.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB(s).

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each CSI-RS to be measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.3.3.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.4.1 Inter-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.4.1.1 Absolute Accuracy of SS-RSRP in FR1

The requirements for absolute accuracy of SS-RSRP in this clause apply
to a cell on a frequency in FR1 that has different carrier frequency
from the serving cell. The accuracy requirements in this clause are also
applicable when *highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1.4.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRP in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1. The
accuracy requirements in this clause are also applicable when
*highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] Clause 7.3 for
reference sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

#### 10.1.4.2 Void

#### 10.1.4.3 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.4.3.1 Absolute Accuracy of CSI-RSRP in FR1

The requirements for absolute accuracy of CSI-RSRP in this clause apply
to a cell where the CSI-RS resources to be measured have the different
center frequency as the CSI-RS resources indicated for measurement in
the serving cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.3.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.4.3.2 Relative Accuracy of CS-RSRP in FR1

The relative accuracy of CSI-RSRP in inter frequency case is defined as
the CSI-RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1compared to the
CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.3.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] Clause 7.3 for
reference sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.3.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

• Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for
inter-frequency measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be
based on the timing of one of the target cells.

\- \|CSI\_RP1~dBm~ - CSI\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

##### 10.1.4C.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRP in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[40\] Clause 7.3 for
reference sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

##### 10.1.5.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the SS-RSRP measured from
another cell on another frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.5.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-2 \[19\] Clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.5.2 Void

#### 10.1.5.3 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.5.3.1 Absolute CSI-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RSRP in this clause apply to a cell on a frequency in FR2 where the
CSI-RS resources to be measured have the different center frequency as
the CSI-RS resources indicated for measurement in the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.5.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant associated
SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.5.3.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

##### 10.1.5.3.2 Relative CSI-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RSRP in inter frequency case is defined as
the CSI-RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to
the CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on another frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.5.3.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-2 \[19\] Clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant associated
SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.5.3.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

\- \|CSI\_RP1~dBm~ - CSI\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

### 10.1.5B Inter-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR2 for CA/DC Idle Mode Measurements

#### 10.1.5B.1 Inter-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a UE:

\- in state RRC\_IDLE or RRC INACTIVE

\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.

The requirements are for absolute accuracy of SS-RSRP.

##### 10.1.5B.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SS-RSRP in this clause apply to a cell on a frequency in FR2 that is on
a different frequency than the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.5B.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.1.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

### 10.1.6 RSRP Measurement Report Mapping

The reporting range of SS-RSRP and CSI-RSRP for L3 reporting is defined
from -156 dBm to -31 dBm with 1 dB resolution. The reporting range of
SS-RSRP and CSI-RSRP for L1 reporting is defined from -140 to -44 dBm
with 1 dB resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.6.1-1. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

The reporting range of differential SS-RSRP and CSI-RSRP for L1
reporting is defined from 0 dB to -30 dB with 2 dB resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.6.1-2. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

#### 10.1.7.2 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.7.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RSRQ in this clause apply to the intra-frequency measurement defined
in 9.10.2.1 in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.7.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for associated SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.7.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

#### 10.1.8.2 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.8.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RSRQ in this clause apply to the intra-frequency measurement defined
in 9.10.2.1 in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.8.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.8.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of
TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.9.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRQ in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRQ in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1. The
accuracy requirements in this clause are also applicable when
*highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.9.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

#### 10.1.9.2 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.9.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RSRQ in this clause apply to the inter-frequency measurement defined
in 9.10.3.1 in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.9.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

> • The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or
> better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.9.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.9.2.2 Relative CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RSRQ is defined as the CSI-RSRQ measured
from one cell compared to the CSI-RSRQ measured from another cell with
the same center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRQ levels measured
on the same cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.9.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for the associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.9.2.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.9C.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRQ in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRQ in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.9C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[40\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

##### 10.1.10.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRQ in FR2

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRQ in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.10.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.10.2 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.10.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RSRQ in this clause apply the inter-frequency measurement defined in
9.10.3.1 in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.10.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

> • The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or
> better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.10.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.10.2.2 Relative CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RSRQ is defined as the CSI-RSRQ measured
from one cell compared to the CSI-RSRQ measured from another cell with
the same center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRQ levels measured
on the same cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.10.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for the associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.10.2.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

#### 10.1.12.2 Intra-frequency CSI-SINR accuracy requirements in FR1

##### 10.1.12.2.1 Absolute CSI-SINR Accuracy in FR1

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-SINR in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.12.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

\- Note: The reference measurement timing for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.12.2.1-1.

#### 10.1.13.1 Intra-frequency SS-SINR accuracy requirements in FR2

##### 10.1.13.1.1 Absolute SS-SINR Accuracy in FR2

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SS-SINR in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.13.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.13.2 Intra-frequency CSI-SINR accuracy requirements in FR2

##### 10.1.13.2.1 Absolute CSI-SINR Accuracy in FR2

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-SINR in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.13.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

• Note: The reference measurement timing for intra-frequency measurement
is serving cell timing.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.13.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.14.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-SINR in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-SINR in inter frequency case is defined as
the SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

#### 10.1.14.2 Inter-frequency CSI-SINR accuracy requirements in FR1

##### 10.1.14.2.1 Aboslute Accuracy of CSI-SINR in FR1

The requirements for absolute accuracy of CSI-SINR in this clause apply
to a cell on a frequency in FR1 that has different carrier frequency
from the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

\- Note: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.14.2.2 Relative Accuracy of CSI-SINR in FR1

The relative accuracy of CSI-SINR in inter frequency case is defined as
the CSI-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to
the CSI-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band.

\- \|CSI\_RP1~dBm~ - CSI\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency measurement
is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing of one of
the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

> \- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or
> better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.2.2-1.

##### 10.1.14C.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-SINR in FR1

The relative accuracy of SS-SINR in inter frequency case is defined as
the SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[40\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

#### 10.1.15.2 Inter-frequency CSI-SINR accuracy requirements in FR2

##### 10.1.15.2.1 Aboslute Accuracy of CSI-SINR in FR2

The requirements for absolute accuracy of CSI-SINR in this clause apply
to a cell on a frequency in FR2 that has different carrier frequency
from the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.15.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency measurement
is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing of one of
the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.15.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.15.2.2 Relative Accuracy of CSI-SINR in FR2

The relative accuracy of CSI-SINR in inter frequency case is defined as
the CSI-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to
the CSI-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.15.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.y for a corresponding Band.

\- \|CSI\_RP1~dBm~ - CSI\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency measurement
is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing of one of
the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.15.2.2-1.

### 10.1.16 SINR report mapping

#### 10.1.16.1 SS-SINR and CSI-SINR measurement report mapping

The reporting range of SS-SINR and CSI-SINR for L3 reporting and L1
reporing is defined from -23 dB to 40 dB with 0.5 dB resolution. The
mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.16.1-1. The range
in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range.

The reporting range of differential SS-SINR and CSI-SINR for L1
reporting is defined from -15 dB to 0 dB with 1 dB resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.16.1-2. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

##### 10.1.19.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SSB based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the cell (serving cell or cell with different PCI from
serving cell) on which UE performs L1-RSRP measurements.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

#### 10.1.19.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.19.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.19.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19.2.2-1.

#### 10.1.19C.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.19C.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19C.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[39\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.19.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19C.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.19C.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19C.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[39\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.19.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19C.2.2-1.

##### 10.1.20.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SSB based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the cell (serving cell or cell with different PCI from
serving cell) on which UE performs L1-RSRP measurements.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.20.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.20.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.20.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20.2.2-1.

### 10.1.22 CLI measurement accuracy requirements

#### 10.1.22.1 SRS-RSRP

##### 10.1.22.1.1 SRS-RSRP Accuracy

The SRS-RSRP measurement reported by the UE shall fulfil the accuracy
requirements defined in Table 10.1.22.1.1-1 for FR1 and Table
10.1.22.1.1-2 for FR2, provided that the following conditions are met.
The accuracy requirements in this clause are derived based on AWGN radio
propagation conditions.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for SRS-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.z for a corresponding Band for each relevant SRS resource configured
for measurement.

\- The time difference between UE's DL reference timing in the serving
cell and SRS arrival time is no larger than T~error\_SRS\_RSRP~, where

\- T~error\_SRS\_RSRP~ = T~C~ × N~TA\_offset~ + 4.67us for FR1

\- T~error\_SRS\_RSRP~ = T~C~ × N~TA\_offset~ + 3.67us for FR2

\- N~TA\_offset~ is defined in Table 7.1.2-2

\- T~C~ is 0.509ns

\- The number of SRS ports in the SRS resource configured for
measurement is 1,

\- The number of symbols in the SRS resource configured for measurement
is 1,

\- The number of repetitions in the SRS resource configured for
measurement is 1,

\- Frequency hopping, sequence group hopping or sequence hopping is
disabled in the SRS resource configured for measurement,

\- The bandwidth of the SRS resource is 48 PRBs.

\- One of the following conditions is met

\- There is no other SRS resource with the same root sequence and on the
same symbol and with same comb as the relevant SRS resource.

\- If multiple SRS resources are on the same symbol and with same comb,
the distance between cyclic shifts of any two resources is no less than
6 if transmissionComb = n4, and no less than 4 if transmissionComb = n2.

##### 10.1.22.1.2 SRS-RSRP report mapping

The reporting range of SRS-RSRP is defined from -140 dBm to -44 dBm with
1 dB resolution. The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table
10.1.22.1.2-1. The range in the signalling may be larger than the
guaranteed accuracy range.

##### 10.1.22.2.2 CLI-RSSI report mapping

The reporting range of CLI-RSSI is defined from -100 dBm to -25 dBm with
1 dB resolution. The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table
10.1.22.2.2-1. The range in the signalling may be larger than the
guaranteed accuracy range. UE shall scale the measured CLI-RSSI to
report a nominal RSSI equivalent to 6RB measurement with 15kHz SCS.

### 10.1.23 RSTD Measurements

#### 10.1.23.1 Introduction

The requirements in Clause 10.1.23 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more DL RSTD measurements
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in Clause 10.1.23 shall
apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG or without MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

#### 10.1.23.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The accuracy requirements for RSTD measurement shall be within
±(X+Y+Z+Δ) T~c~.

X is defined in Table 10.1.23.2-1 for AWGN channel and Table 10.1.23.2-3
for fading channel for FR1, provided that the following conditions are
met.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE does not perform positioning measurement with reduced number of
samples.

X is defined in Table 10.1.23.2-2 for AWGN channel and Table 10.1.23.2-4
for fading channel for FR2, provided that the following conditions are
met.

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
> B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
> configured for measurement.
>
> \- UE does not perform positioning measurement with reduced number of
> samples.

X is defined in Table 10.1.23.2-7 for AWGN channel in FR1 provided that
the following conditions are met.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE supports positioning measurement with reduced number of sample and
is indicated by LMF to perform positioning measurement with reduced
number of samples.

X is defined in Table 10.1.23.2-8 for AWGN channel in FR2 provided that
the following conditions are met.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE supports positioning measurement with reduced number of sample and
is indicated by LMF to perform positioning measurement with reduced
number of samples.

Note: The requriements for fading channel in this clause are derived
based on TDL-A (30 ns delay spread, 5Hz) and TDL-C (60 ns delay spread,
300 Hz) channel models for FR1 and FR2 respectively.

When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging to different PFLs, then
the RSTD accuracy is defined as the accuracy corresponding to the
largest accuracy value among different PFLs.

If the UE doesn't support Rx TEG reporting for RSTD measurement or when
the measurements of reference cell and **neighbour cell belong to
different Rx TEGs, Y, Z and** Δ **are defined as follows:**

\- When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging to same PFL, Y=32
Tc, provided that the time offset between the two PRS resource instances
from the reference cell and the neighbor cell, which are used for a
single RSTD estimate, is no greater than 160 ms.

\- When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging different PFLs,
Y=256 Tc, provided that the time offset between the two PRS resource
instances from the reference cell and the neighbor cell, which are used
for a single RSTD estimate, is no greater than 1280 ms.

\- Z is defined in Table 10.1.23.2-5 for FR1 and Table 10.1.23.2-6 for
FR2, respectively.

\- Δ is zero for single PFL, and is defined in Table 10.1.23.2-5a for
FR1 and Table 10.1.23.2-6a for FR2, respectively, for dual PFL.

If the measurements of reference cell and **neighbour cell belong to the
same Rx TEG, i.e. associated and reported with a common Rx TEG ID, then
the sum of Y+Z+**Δ **is equal to the timing error margin of the Rx TEG
reported in *nr-UE-RxTEG-TimingErrorMargin*. The timing error margin
reported via *nr-UE-RxTEG-TimingErrorMargin* cannot be larger than the
value of (Y+Z****+**Δ**) defined when** the UE does not associate the
measurements with the same Rx TEG**.**

##### 10.1.23.3.2 Differential Reporting for DL RSTD Measurement

A first DL RSTD measurement is reported by means of differential
reporting, i.e. as ∆RSTD, relative to a second DL RSTD measurement
(RSTD2), provided that:

\- the absolute measured quantity value of the second DL RSTD
measurement (RSTD2) is not larger than the absolute measured quantity
value of the first DL RSTD measurement (RSTD1), i.e.,
∆RSTD=RSTD1-RSTD2≥0, and

\- the absolute value of the second DL RSTD measurement (RSTD2) is
reported together with ∆RSTD for the first DL RSTD measurement.

The reporting range for differential reporting ∆RSTD of the first DL
RSTD measurement is defined from 0 up to 8191×T~c~ with the resolution
step of 2*^k^*×T~c~, where

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min~*=\[2\] and *k~max~*=5, when configured PRS resource of at least
one of the reference cell and neighbor cell measured for the first RSTD
measurement or second RSTD measurement is in FR1,

*k~min~*=0 and *k~max~*=5, when configured PRS resource of both the
reference cell and neighbor cell measured for both of the first RSTD
measurement and the second RSTD measurement are in FR2,

*k≥* *timingReportingGranularityFactor* \[34\] configured by LMF via LPP
for the RSTD measurement.

The measurement report mapping for different *k* values are specified in
Tables 10.1.23.3.2-1 − 10.1.23.3.2-6.

##### 10.1.23.3.3 Additional Path Report Mapping for DL RSTD

The reporting range for the additional path reporting for an RSTD
measurement is defined up to the range from -8175×T~c~ to 8175×T~c~ with
the resolution step of 2*^k^*×T~c~, where

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min~*=\[2\] and *k~max~*=5, when configured PRS resource of at least
one of the reference cell and neighbor cell measured for the RSTD
measurement is in FR1,

*k~min~*=0 and *k~max~*=5, when configured PRS resource of both the
reference cell and neighbor cell measured for the RSTD measurement are
in FR2,

*k≥* *timingReportingGranularityFactor* \[34\] configured by LMF via LPP
for the RSTD measurement.

The UE can report the timing of up to two additional paths with respect
to the path timing determining the RSTD measurement.

A UE capable of *additionalPathsExtSupport-r17* can report the timing
for a number additional paths, up to its capability, with respect to the
path timing determining the RSTD measurement.

The report mappings for different *k* values are specified in Tables
10.1.23.3.3-1 − 10.1.23.3.3-6.

### 10.1.24 PRS-RSRP Measurements

#### 10.1.24.1 Introduction

The requirements in Clause 10.1.24 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* or
*nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* or
*nr-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP \[34\]
requesting the UE to report one or more DL PRS-RSRP measurements defined
in TS 38.215 \[4\].

The requirements in clause 10.1.24 apply for UE in RRC\_CONNECTED,
including PRS-RSRP measurement with MG and outside MG, as well as for UE
in RRC\_INACTIVE. For PRS-RSRP measurement in FR2, the requirements
apply with and without reduced Rx beam sweeping factor.

#### 10.1.24.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

##### 10.1.24.2.2 Relative PRS RSRP accuracy

The relative accuracy of PRS-RSRP is defined as accuracy of the
difference between two PRS-RSRP measurements.

The relative PRS-RSRP accuracy requirements apply for the cases when
PRS-RSRP is measured from PRS resources in the same PRS resource set in
FR1 or FR2, and measured with same Rx beam in case of FR2.

The accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRP measurement for FR1 defined in
Table 10.1.24.2.2-1 are valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-1 Clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity
are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

\- UE does not support positioning measurements with reduced number of
samples, or LMF does not indicate UE to perform positioning measurements
with reduced number of samples

The accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRP measurement for FR2 defined in
Table 10.1.24.2.2-2 are valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-2 Clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity
are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

\- UE does not support positioning measurements with reduced number of
samples, or LMF does not indicate UE to perform positioning measurements
with reduced number of samples

The reporting range of differential PRS-RSRP is defined from -30 dB to 0
dB with 1 dB resolution when *nr-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation*
message is received.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.24.3.2-1. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

The reporting range of differential PRS-RSRP is defined from -30 dB to
30 dB with 1 dB resolution when *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation*
or *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation is received*.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.24.3.2-2. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range
or the range supported by the UE receiver for differentail RSRP measured
on different PRS resources in frequency domain at the same time.

### 10.1.25 UE Rx-Tx Time Difference Measurements

#### 10.1.25.1 Introduction

The requirements in Clause 10.1.25 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[31\] requesting the UE to report one or more UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in
Clause 10.1.25 shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG or without MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

#### 10.1.25.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

> N~TA\_offset~ defined in Table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
> measurement period or
>
> if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
> measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within \[-160, 160\] msec of at least one DL
PRS resource of each of the TRPs in the assistance data.

If the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the autonomous timing adjustment defined in
clause 7.1.2 then:

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall apply for a cell,
which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in section 7.1.1) for
SRS transmission even if the uplink transmission timing changes during
the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall not apply for a
cell, which is not the downlink reference cell (defined in section
7.1.1) for SRS transmission, if the uplink transmission timing changes
during the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The relative accuracy of UE Rx-Tx measurement in this clause is defined
as accuracy of the difference between two UE Rx-Tx measurements.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.25.2-1 for FR1 are valid under
the following conditions:

Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

PRP\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band.

AWGN propagation condition.

#### 10.1.25.3 Report mapping

Absolute UE Rx-Tx measurement reporting in clause 10.1.25.3.1,
differential reporting for UE Rx-Tx measurement in clause 10.1.25.3.2,
and additional path report mapping for UE Rx-Tx measurement in clause
10.1.25.3.3 applies, regardless of number of samples used to measure
PRS, to report:

\- TEG based measurement corresponding to UE reported Rx TEG in
*nr-UE-Rx-TEG-ID-r17* \[34\],

\- gap-based UE Rx-Tx measurement,

\- gapless UE Rx-Tx measurement,

\- UE Rx-Tx in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

##### 10.1.25.3.1 Absolute UE Rx-Tx Measurement Report Mapping

The reporting range for the absolute UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement (T~UE\ Rx-Tx~) is defined from -985024×T~c~ to 985024×T~c~
with the resolution step of 2*^k^*×T~c~, where:

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min~*=\[2\] and *k~max~*=5, when at least one of the PRS and the SRS
resources configured for T~UE\ Rx-Tx~ is in FR1,

*k~min~*=0 and *k~max~*=5, when both PRS and SRS resources configured
for T~UE\ Rx-Tx~ are in FR2,

*k≥* *timingReportingGranularityFactor* \[34\] configured by LMF via LPP
for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.

The T~UE\ Rx-Tx~ report mapping for *k* = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are
specified in Tables 10.1.25.3.1-1, 10.1.25.3.1-2, 10.1.25.3.1-3,
10.1.25.3.1-4, 10.1.25.3.1-5, and 10.1.25.3.1-6, respectively.

##### 10.1.25.3.3 Additional Path Report Mapping for UE Rx-Tx Time Difference

The reporting range for the additional path reporting for an UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement is defined up to the range from -8175×T~c~
to 8175×T~c~ with the resolution step of 2*^k^*×T~c~, where

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min~*=\[2\] and *k~max~*=5, when at least one of the PRS resource and
SRS resource configured for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is
in FR1,

*k~min~*=0 and *k~max~*=5, when both of the PRS resource and SRS
resource configured for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is in
FR2,

*k≥* *timingReportingGranularityFactor* \[34\] configured by LMF via LPP
for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.

The UE can report the timing of up to two additional paths with respect
to the path timing determining the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.

The UE capable of *additionalPathsExtSupport-r17* can report the timing
of up to its supported number of additional paths with respect to the
path timing determining the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The report mappings for different *k* values are specified in Tables
10.1.25.3.3-1 − 10.1.25.3.3-6.

### 10.1.27 L1-SINR accuracy requirements for FR1

#### 10.1.27.1 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and no dedicated IMR configured

##### 10.1.27.1.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-SINR in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources
configured as CMR and no dedicated resource configured as IMR of the
serving cell configured for L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.27.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.27.1.1-1.

##### 10.1.27.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-SINR is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-SINR among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.27.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.27.1.2-1.

#### 10.1.27.2 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with SSB based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

##### 10.1.27.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SSB based L1-SINR in this clause apply to all SSBs configured as CMR and
dedicated resources configured as IMR of the serving cell configured for
L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.27.2.1-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.27.2.1-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.27.2.1-1 and 10.1.27.2.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.27.2.1-1 and
10.1.27.2.1-2.

##### 10.1.27.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SSB based L1-SINR is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one SSB configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all SSBs and
IMRs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.27.2.2-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.27.2.2-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.27.2.2-1 and 10.1.27.2.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.27.2.2-1 and
10.1.27.2.2-2.

#### 10.1.27.3 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

##### 10.1.27.3.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-SINR in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources
configured as CMR and dedicated resources configured as IMR of the
serving cell configured for L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.27.3.1-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.27.3.1-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.27.3.1-1 and 10.1.27.3.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and
ZP-IMR is equal to or better than the accuracy requirements in Tables
10.1.27.3.1-1 and 10.1.27.3.1-2.

##### 10.1.27.3.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-SINR is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all CSI-RS and
IMR resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.27.3.2-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.27.3.2-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.27.3.2-1 and 10.1.27.3.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and
ZP-IMR is equal to or better than the accuracy requirements in Tables
10.1.27.3.2-1 and 10.1.27.3.2-2.

### 10.1.28 L1-SINR accuracy requirements for FR2

10.1.28.1 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and no
dedicated IMR configured

10.1.28.1.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-SINR in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources
configured as CMR and no dedicated resource configured as IMR of the
serving cell configured for L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.28.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.28.1.1-1.

10.1.28.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-SINR is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-SINR among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.28.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.28.1.2-1.

10.1.28.2 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with SSB based CMR and dedicated
IMR configured

10.1.28.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SSB based L1-SINR in this clause apply to all SSBs configured as CMR and
dedicated resources configured as IMR of the serving cell configured for
L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.28.2.1-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.28.2.1-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.28.2.1-1 and 10.1.28.2.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- SSB based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.28.2.1-1 and
10.1.28.2.1-2.

10.1.28.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SSB based L1-SINR is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one SSB configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all SSB based
CMRs and IMRs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.28.2.2-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.28.2.2-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.28.2.2-1 and 10.1.28.2.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- SSB based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.28.2.2-1 and
10.1.28.2.2-2.

10.1.28.3 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and
dedicated IMR configured

10.1.28.3.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-SINR in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources as CMR
and dedicated resources configured as IMR of the serving cell configured
for L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.28.3.1-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.28.3.1-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.28.3.1-1 and 10.1.28.3.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- CSI-RS based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and

10.1.28.3.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-SINR is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all CSI-RS based
CMRs and IMRs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in Table 10.1.28.3.2-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in Table 10.1.28.3.2-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in Tables 10.1.28.3.2-1 and 10.1.28.3.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- CSI-RS based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and
ZP-IMR is equal to or better than the accuracy requirements in Tables
10.1.28.3.2-1 and 10.1.28.3.2-2.

##### 10.1.30.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRQ

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRQ in inter-frequency case is defined as
the RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency compared to the RSRP
measured from another cell on a different frequency, with at least one
of the two frequencies being under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.30.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.10 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

##### 10.1.32.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-SINR

The relative accuracy of SS-SINR in inter frequency case is defined as
the SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency, with at
least one of the two frequencies being under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.32.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band.

\- SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

##### 10.1.36.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the SS-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.36.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1.37.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRP

The relative accuracy of SS-RSRP in inter frequency case is defined as
the RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency compared to the RSRP
measured from another cell on a different frequency, with at least one
of the two frequencies being under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.37.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

### 10.1.38 PRS-RSRPP Measurements

#### 10.1.38.1 Introduction

The requirements in Clause 10.1.38.2 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP
\[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more DL PRS-RSRPP measurements
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in Clause 10.1.38 shall
apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

The requirements in Clause 10.1.38.2 apply for the first path PRS-RSRP
measurement.

#### 10.1.38.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

##### 10.1.38.2.1 Absolute PRS RSRPP accuracy

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement for FR1
defined in Table 10.1.38.2.1-1 and Table 10.1.38.2.1-3 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-1 Clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity
are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement for FR2
defined in Table 10.1.38.2.1-2 and Table 10.1.38.2.1-4 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-2 Clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity
are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement defined in
Table 10.1.38.2.1-1 and Table 10.1.38.2.1-2 apply for the UE not
supporting *supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* \[34\] or LMF does not
indicate UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number of
samples.

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement defined in
Table 10.1.38.2.1-3 and Table 10.1.38.2.1-4 apply for the UE supporting
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* \[34\].

Note: The requriements in this clause are derived based on two-tap
channel defined in 38.101-4 Annex B.2.4 (a = 1, τ~d~=0.45 µs and f~D~=5
Hz).

Note: The requirements in this clause are derived based on the
difference between the estimated PRS-RSRPP compared to the ideal
PRS-RSRPP defined as

$$\text{RSRPP}_{p} \propto \left| \sum_{k}^{}{H_{k}\exp\left( j2\pi D_{p}\frac{k}{N_{\text{IFFT}}} \right)} \right|^{2}$$

**Where:**

$H_{k}$ **is the effective channel frequency response (over REs occupied
by PRS) measured without receiver noise.**

$D_{p}$ **is the exact delay of the p-th path in the channel model.**

### *10.1.39* UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements for RTT-based PDC

#### 10.1.39.1 *Void*

#### 10.1.39.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements for PRS

The error in the reported value of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement,
including both the measurement error and the reporting quantization
error, shall be within the accuracy requirements specified in this
clause.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

\- N~TA\_offset~ defined in Table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period or

\- if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within \[-160, 160\] msec of at least one PDC
DL PRS resource from the serving cell (PCell).

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.39.2-1 for FR1 are valid under
the following conditions:

Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

> PRP\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band.

AWGN propagation condition.

#### 10.1.39.3 Measurement Accuracy Requirements for TRS

The error in the reported value of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement,
including both the measurement error and the reporting quantization
error, shall be within the accuracy requirements specified in this
clause.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

\- N~TA\_offset~ defined in Table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period or

\- if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within \[-160, 160\] msec of at least one PDC
TRS resource from the serving cell (PCell).

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.39.3-1 for FR1 are valid under
the following conditions:

Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

> PRP\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.2.13 for a corresponding Band.

AWGN propagation condition.

10.1A NR measurements for RedCap
--------------------------------

### 10.1A.1 Introduction

The requirements in this section are applicable for RedCap UE as
follows:

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for PCell measurements in SA,

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for non-serving cell measurements
on NR carrier frequencies.

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for measurements from one cell on
a frequency compared to the measurement from another cell on a different
frequency.

The accuracy requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio
propagation conditions. The accuracy requirements of RSRP, RSRQ amd SINR
are applicable provided that reference SSB is not changed during
measurement period.

### 10.1A.2 Intra-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR1

#### 10.1A.2.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1A.2.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.2.1.1 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in Table 10.1A.2.1.1-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.15 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1A.2.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.2.1.2 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in Table 10.1A.2.1.2-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.15 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1A.8.1.2 Relative Accuracy of SS-RSRQ in FR1

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.9.1.2 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in Table 10.1A.8.1.2-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to Annex B.2.16 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

#### 10.1A.14.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1A.14.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.19.2.2 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in Table 10.1A.14.2.1-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1A.19.2.1-1.

##### 10.1A.14.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.19.2.2 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in Table 10.1A.14.2.2-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1A.14.2.2-1.

    RRC\_CONNECTED state and the corresponding side conditions shall be
    the same as the inter-frequency RS-SINR accuracy requirements in
    clause 9.1.17.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\].

The reporting range and mapping for E-UTRA RS-SINR measurements shall be
the same as specified for RS-SINR measurements in clause 9.1.17.1 of TS
36.133 \[15\].

10.3 UTRAN FDD Measurements
---------------------------

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a UE:

\- in state RRC\_CONNECTED

\- performing measurements according to clause 9.4.6 with appropriate
measurement gaps

\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.

The reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering shall be an
estimate of the average value of the measured quantity over the
measurement period. The reference point for the measurement result after
layer 1 filtering is referred to as point B in the measurement model
described in TS 25.302 \[30\].

The accuracy requirements in this clause are valid for the reported
measurement result after layer 1 filtering. The accuracy requirements
are verified from the measurement report at point D in the measurement
model having the layer 3 filtering disabled.

### 10.3.1 UTRAN FDD CPICH RSCP

NOTE: This measurement is for handover between E-UTRAN and UTRAN FDD.

The requirements in this clause are valid for terminals supporting this
capability.

The measurement period for RRC\_CONNECTED state is specified in
clause 9.4.6.

In RRC\_CONNECTED state the accuracy requirements shall meet the
absolute accuracy requirements in table 10.3.1-1, under the following
conditions:

\- CPICH Ec/Io condition for a detectable cell is as specified in clause
9.4.6;

\- SCH\_Ec/Io condition for a detectable cell is as specified in clause
9.4.6.

#### 10.4.2.2 PSBCH-RSRP Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of PSBCH-RSRP is defined as the PSBCH-RSRP
measured from one V2X synchronization source compared to the PSBCH-RSRP
measured from another V2X synchronization source on the same frequency
in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.4.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Demodulation reference signals are transmitted from one port.

\- Conditions defined in Clause 7.3E of TS38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for PSBCH-RSRP accuracy measurements are fulfilled
according to Annex B.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant
PSBCH-DMRS.

### 10.4.5 Intra-Frequency Discovery Signal Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a remote sidelink UE:

\- is out of coverage on the frequency used for sidelink, and

\- that is synchronised to the sidelink relay UE that is measured.

#### 10.4.5.1 Absolute Discovery Signal Measurement Accuracy

The requirements for absolute accuracy of discovery signal measurement
in this clause apply to a sidelink UE performing SD-RSRP measurements
for direct to indirect path swich or SL-RSRP measurements for indirect
to direct path switch on the same frequency as used by the sidelink
relay UE transmitting the relay Discovery message.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.4.5.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Demodulation reference signals for PSCCH and/or PSSCH are transmitted
from one port.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3E of TS38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- PSCCH-RSRP\|dBm and/or PSSCH-RSRP\|dBm according to Annex B.4.4 for a
corresponding Band are fulfilled.

Table 10.4.5.1-1: Intra-frequency discovery signal measurement absolute
accuracy for a remote sidelink UE \[2\] capable of sidelink
Communication and sidelink Discovery and configured by upper layers for
relay operation.
