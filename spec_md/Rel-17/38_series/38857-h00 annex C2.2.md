#### C.2.2.2 Results from source \[8\]

##### C.2.2.2.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

For DL positioning enhancement, aperiodic PRS (A-PRS) could be
introduced to reduce positioning latency. In this section, evaluation
scenarios and parameters for positioning latency analysis of A-PRS based
positioning solution are given as below:

\- Case ID: 1.

\- SCS: 15kHz.

\- Frequency Band: FR1.

\- Positioning Technique: DL-TDOA.

\- Periodicity of PRS: Aperiodic PRS \[R1-2007860\]

\- Duration time of PRS: 4ms

##### C.2.2.2.2 Latency analysis of NR positioning enhancements

For DL positioning enhancement, aperiodic PRS could be introduced. From
our point of view, aperiodic measurement gap can be configured for
aperiodic PRS \[R1-2007860\]. Therefore, whenever triggering, UE should
measure those PRS resources. In addition, for measurement reporting, the
SR request and UL grant procedures could be arranged before A-PRS
triggering. Therefore, the reporting time could be reduced further. The
enhanced procedure of DL-TDOA is shown in Figure C.2.2.2.2-1.

height="3.7395833333333335in"}

Figure C.2.2.2.2-1: Enhanced PHY procedure for DL-TDOA

The total delay could be calculated as

$$T_{\text{total}} = T_{\text{trig}} + T_{\text{ariv}} + T_{\text{process}} + T_{\text{report}}$$

where,

\- $T_{\text{trig}}$ denotes the time to receive and decode the A-PRS
triggering signaling.

\- $T_{\text{ariv}}$ denotes the delay when DL PRS is received, which is
related to the PRS offset value configured by the A-PRS triggering
signaling

\- $T_{\text{process}}$ denotes the time from UE begins to measure PRS
until the measurement result is ready, which is related to UE capability
and the number of PRS resources needed to be measured.

\- $T_{\text{report}}$ denotes the time for measurement reporting, which
includes SR request, PDCCH-based UL grant and PUSCH-based measurement
result reporting..

Assume DCI signalling is used to trigger A-PRS, 1ms could be assumed for
$T_{\text{trig}}$. Current UE capability is defined as N ms of DL PRS
symbols being processed in every T ms for a given maximum bandwidth (B)
in MHz supported by UE. N = {0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50}ms and T = {8, 16, 20, 30, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640,
1280}ms. Assume Y ms of PRS resources are configured, the processing
time could be calculated as
$T_{\text{process}} = \frac{Y}{N} \bullet T$.

Summary of latency performance analysis for NR positioning enhancements
is provided in Table C.2.2.2.2-1 with the assumption of SCS 15 kHz, and
a moderate UE capability, i.e. N=4, T=8.

#### C.2.2.4 Results from source \[10\]

##### C.2.2.4.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

In order to perform latency analysis for enhanced NR positioning
solutions, we use the following assumptions:

\- gNB location request: 2 symbols

\- Provides activation of DL PRS, UL SRS transmission, and scheduling
information for UE measurement report (e.g. resources for UE measurement
report transmission can be associated with resources of SRS for
positioning or directly indicated)

\- DL PRS and UL SRS for positioning transmission are performed
sequentially

\- No MG configuration and BWP switching considerations

\- DL PRS resource: 2 symbols, Comb-6, 4 symbols in total per DL PRS
Resource Set

\- SRS for positioning configuration -- same as in reference system
configuration

\- DL PRS processing delay -- 2 ms (in scope of RAN WG4)

\- UE measurement report

\- 7 symbols PUSCH duration (same as in reference system configuration)

Other assumptions are the same as in reference system configuration

Based on analysis in table above, we have following observations

\- DL-TDOA latency of L1 components = Step 1 + Step 2 + Step 4 = 3.8839
ms

\- Estimated higher layer signaling time (L2/L3 components) is up to 4ms

\- Total time is about 8 ms

\- UL-TDOA latency of L1 components = Step 1 + Step 3 = 1.9018 ms

\- Estimated higher layer signaling time (L2/L3 components) is up to 3ms

\- Total time is about 5 ms

\- Multi-RTT latency of L1 components = Step 1 + Step 2 + Step 3 =
4.1875 ms

\- It is assumed that Step 4 is done in parallel with Step 3B,3C,3D

\- Estimated higher layer signaling time (L2/L3 components) is up to 4ms

\- Total time is about 8.2 ms

#### C.2.2.5 Results from source \[16\]

##### C.2.2.5.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

The latency analysis of enhancements for the UE-assisted DL methods are
presented here. All analysis are based on 30kHz SCS. The minimum latency
value is presented here. Specifically, we perform the latency analysis
of three following enhancements:

\- No measurement gap for DL PRS reception

\- Measurement gap activation/deactivation

\- On-demand PRS

#### C.2.2.7 Results from source \[15\]

##### C.2.2.7.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

To evaluate physical layer latency for the enhanced NR positioning
solution(s), we use followings assumption as below:

\- The gNB provides the UE with reporting resource of positioning
measurements when the gNB configures MG.

\- Numerology: 15 kHz (for PDCCH, PDSCH, PUCCH, PUSCH, SRS)

\- For PUSCH transmission:

\- Uplink switching gap is not configured.

\- No BWP switching

\- No overlapping symbols of the PUCCH and the scheduled PUSCH

\- The number of PUSCH symbols = from 4 to 14 for Type A

\- The number of PUSCH symbols = from 1 to 14 for Type B

\- According to the size of data (e.g. LPP message) to be transmitted,
the number of symbols can be changed.

\- For PDSCH transmission:

\- No overlapping symbols of the scheduling PDCCH and the scheduled
PDSCH

\- The number of PDSCH symbols = from 3 to 14 for Type A

\- The number of PDSCH symbols = from 2 to 14 for Type B

\- According to the size of data (e.g. LPP message) to be transmitted,
the number of symbols can be changed.

\- For SRS transmission:

\- One shot transmission (2 OS \~ 12 OS)

\- According to resource type (periodic, Semi-persistent and aperiodic),
the number of symbols can be changed.

Note 1: Some components denoted by (\*) can be excluded since they are
related with higher layer procedure.

Note 2: The maximum latency for PDSCH/PUSCH transmission is assumed as
one slot excluding preparation time. Total values may change when the
information size related with LPP message is changed.
