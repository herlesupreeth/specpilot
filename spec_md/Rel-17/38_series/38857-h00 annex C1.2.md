### C.1.2 Physical layer latency analysis for Rel-16 

#### C.1.2.1 Results from source \[4\]

##### C.1.2.1.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

The physical layer latency for the following positioning methods are
provided

\- UE-A DL-only positioning

\- UL-only positioning

\- DL E-CID

\- UL E-CID

\- UE-B DL-only positioning

##### C.1.2.1.2 Latency analysis of Rel.16 solutions

Latency analysis for the Rel.16 NR positioning is provided in Tables
C.1.2.1.2-1 to C.1.2.1.2-6.

The latency for multi-RTT positioning should be the maximum between
DL-TDOA/DL-AoD and UL-TDOA/UL-AoA, which is the same as DL-TDOA/DL-AoD
considering UL delay is much smaller than DL.

#### C.1.2.3 Results from source \[8\] 

##### C.1.2.3.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

##### C.1.2.3.2 Latency analysis for Rel.16 solutions

In this section, we analyse the physical layer latency for both DL-TDOA
and UL-TDOA. For DL-TDOA, the physical layer procedure is shown in
Figure C.1.2.3.2-1.

Figure C.1.2.3.2-1: PHY procedure for DL-TDOA

According to Figure C.1.2.3.2-1, the total PHY delay could be calculated
as

$$T_{\text{total}} = T_{gap,req} + T_{gap,cfg} + T_{\text{ariv}} + T_{\text{process}} + T_{\text{report}}$$

where,

\- $T_{gap,req}$ denotes the time to require measurement gap, which is
1ms according to the result of URLLC latency in TR 38.824.

\- $T_{g\text{ap},cfg}$ denotes the time for measurement gap
configuration, which could be assumed as 10ms according to RRC
reconfiguration procedure delay in TS 38.331.

\- $T_{\text{ariv}}$ denotes the delay between the time when DL PRS is
received and the time when measurement gap configuration is received,
which is related to the maximum value of the configured periodicity of
PRS and measurement gap.

\- $T_{\text{process}}$ denotes the time from UE begins to measure PRS
until the measurement result is ready to report. $T_{\text{process}}$is
related to UE capability and the number of PRS resources needed to be
measured.

\- $T_{\text{report}}$ denotes the time for measurement reporting, which
includes SR request, PDCCH-based UL grant and PUSCH-based measurement
result reporting.

The value of $T_{\text{report}}$ could be assumed as 0.5ms for URLLC
according to section 5.2.1 of TR 36.881. The value of
$T_{\text{process}}$ may be inferred from the minimum periodicity of PRS
and measurement gap, since the measurement result has to be reported
before the next PRS occasion.

In Rel-16, the periodicity of PRS includes the following values:
$2^{\mu}\left\{ 4,\ 5,\ 8,\ 10,\ 16,\ 20,\ 32,\ 40,\ 64,\ 80,\ 160,\ 320,\ 640,\ 1280,\ 2560,\ 5120,\ 10240 \right\}$
slots. For the periodicity of measurement gap, the following values are
supported:
$\left\{ 20,\ 40,\ 80,\ 160,\ \lbrack 320,\ 640\rbrack \right\}$ms.

For example, assume SCS is 15kHz, the periodicity of PRS is 4 slots and
the periodicity of measurement gap is 20ms, the PHY latency could be
summarized in the following table.

Latency components are recommended to be captured in table and ordered
consequently in time starting from the earliest oneLatency analysis for
the Rel.16 NR positioning (DL-TDOA) is provided in Table C.1.2.3.2-1.

The total delay could be calculated as

$$T_{\text{total}} = T_{SRS,act} + T_{\text{prep}} + T_{\text{process}}$$

where,

\- $T_{SRS,act}$ denotes the time to activate the SRS transmission.

\- $T_{\text{prep}}$ denotes the delay from effective time of SRS
activation until UE begins to transmit SRS, which is related to the
value of the configured periodicity of SRS.

\- $T_{\text{process}}$ denotes the time from gNB begins to measure SRS
until the measurement result is ready, which is related to UE capability
and the number of SRS resources needed to be measured.

If SRS is activated by MAC-CE, 3ms delay could be assumed. Similar to
Case 1, the value of $T_{\text{process}}$ may be inferred from the
minimum periodicity of SRS. In Rel-16, the periodicity of SRS for 15 kHz
SCS includes the following values:

\- {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32, 40, 64, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280,
2560, 5120, 10240} slots. Assume the periodicity of SRS is 1 slot, the
PHY latency could be get.

Latency components are recommended to be captured in table and ordered
consequently in time starting from the earliest oneLatency analysis for
the Rel.16 NR positioning (UL-TDOA) is provided in Table C.1.2.3.2-2.

#### C.1.2.4 Results from source \[13\]

##### C.1.2.4.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

We analyse the case of Network Initiated location request where the
positioning method is DL-TDOA/DL-AoD in Case 1/2 and also for
UL-TDOA/UL-AoA in Case 3. We only consider the RRC state as connected
mode. Note that this analysis assumes that the higher layer components
are taken into account in separate analysis and the definition of start
and stop times for PHY layer latency are used. For Case 3 we assume that
SRS-Pos already being configured (e.g., higher layer latency takes this
into account, see RAN2 analysis).

(MG) configuration, while Table C.1.2.5.2-2 presents the same scenario
without a Measurement Gap (MG) configuration.

Table C.1.2.5.2-3 presents the UE-Based DL-TDOA/DL-AoD physical layer
latency evaluations by taking into account the minimum and cautious
latency estimates (within the value range) of the various delay
components (starting with the earliest component) with a Measurement Gap
(MG) configuration, while Table C.1.2.5.2-4 presents the same scenario
without a Measurement Gap (MG) configuration.

#### C.1.2.8 Results from source \[10\] 

##### C.1.2.8.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

In order to provide NR positioning physical layer latency analysis, we
use the following reference system configuration which is in favor of
low latency positioning and were used in NR URLLC studies \[3GPP 38.824,
v16.0.0\]

\- Spectrum -- FDD / FR1

\- SCS -- 30 kHz

\- PDCCH,

\- Monitoring occasions -- 7 per slot \[1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0\]

\- Duration -- 1 symbol

\- PDSCH

\- One symbol overlap with PDCCH

\- Duration -- 2, 4, 7 symbols (Type B mapping)

\- Slot boundary is respected (i.e. transmission does not cross slot
boundary)

\- PUSCH

\- Any symbol, subject to slot boundary constraint (i.e. transmission
does not cross slot boundary)

\- Duration -- 2, 4, 7 symbols (Type B mapping w/ front loaded DMRS)

\- PUCCH

\- 7 occasions per slot \[1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0\] for SR and HARQ
feedback

\- Duration -- 1 symbol

\- No HARQ -- initial transmission is successful

\- SRS for positioning

\- Single resource, 1 symbol duration

\- Periodicity -- each slot

\- DL PRS

\- 18 resources / 4 symbols per resource / 12 Comb-6 symbols per period

\- Periodicity -- 20 ms

\- UE DL PRS processing capability -- N = 0.5 ms (\~12 symbols \@30kHz),
T = 8 ms

\- UE capability for Tproc,1 Tproc,2

\- Capability \# 2 (for low latency)

\- Measurement gap

\- Type 1: BWP switching = 2 slots @ 30kHz

\- MGL = 5.5 ms, MGRP = 20ms

\- 2 BWP switching times per occasion (from and to active DL BWP) + DL
PRS duration =\> 5 slots

\- Nsample = 4 (RAN4 core measurements requirements)

\- UE is expected to perform measurements on DL PRS resource 4 times
(i.e. across 4 periods)

##### C.1.2.8.2 Latency analysis for Rel.16 solutions

Latency analysis for the Rel.16 NR positioning is provided in Table
C.1.2.8.2-1, C.1.2.8.2-2 and C.1.2.8.2-3.

|                        |                 | so the UE would have   |

##### C.1.2.11.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

We assumed the UEs in the RRC connected mode for the physical layer
latency analysis, and we provide the latency analysis on the physical
layer only as well as physical layer latency with the consideration of
higher layer. The following cases are considered.

\- Case 1: DL-TDOA/DL-AoD positioning method for the NW initiated

\- Case 2: DL-TDOA/DL-AoD positioning method for the UE initiated

\- Case 3: UL-TDOA/UL-AoA positioning method for the NW initiated

\- Case 4: Multi-RTT positioning method for the NW initiated

\- Case 5: E-CID positioning method for the NW initiated

To evaluate physical layer latency for the enhanced NR positioning
solution(s), we use the following assumptions as below:

\- Numerology: 15 kHz (for PDCCH, PDSCH, PUCCH, PUSCH, SRS)

\- For PUSCH transmission:

\- Uplink switching gap is not configured.

\- No BWP switching
