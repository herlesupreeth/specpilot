4 General aspects
=================

4.1 NG Architecture
-------------------

The NG-RAN is layered into a Radio Network Layer (RNL) and a Transport
Network Layer (TNL). The NG-RAN architecture, i.e. the NG-RAN logical
nodes and interfaces between them, are defined as part of the RNL.

The NG-RAN architecture consists of a set of gNBs and ng-eNBs which are
connected to the 5GC through the NG interface and is specified in TS
38.300 \[7\].

The NG-RAN may have several NG access points towards the 5GC. As a
minimum, each NG access point\
(in NG-RAN or 5GC) shall independently fulfil the requirements of the
relevant NG specifications (3GPP 38.41x series - see clause 7).

NG is a logical interface.

There may be multiple NG-C logical interfaces towards the 5GC from any
one NG-RAN node. The selection of the NG-C interface is then determined
by the NAS Node Selection function as described in clause 5.

There may be multiple NG-U logical interfaces towards the 5GC from any
one NG-RAN node. The selection of the NG-U interface is done within the
5GC and signalled to the NG-RAN node by the AMF.

4.2 NG interface general principles
-----------------------------------

The general principles for the specification of the NG interface are as
follows:

\- the NG interface is open;

\- the NG interface supports the exchange of signalling information
between the NG-RAN and 5GC;

\- from a logical standpoint, the NG is a point-to-point interface
between an NG-RAN node and a 5GC node. A point-to-point logical
interface is feasible even in the absence of a physical direct
connection between the NG-RAN and 5GC;

\- the NG interface supports control plane and user plane separation;

\- the NG interface separates Radio Network Layer and Transport Network
Layer;

\- the NG interface is future proof to fulfil different new requirements
and support of new services and new functions;

\- the NG interface is decoupled with the possible NG-RAN deployment
variants;

\- the NG Application Protocol supports modular procedures design and
uses a syntax allowing optimized encoding /decoding efficiency.

4.3 NG interface specification objectives
-----------------------------------------

The NG interface specification facilitates the following:

\- inter-connection of NG-RAN nodes with AMFs supplied by different
manufacturers;

\- separation of NG interface Radio Network functionality and Transport
Network functionality to facilitate introduction of future technology.

4.4 NG interface capabilities
-----------------------------

The NG interface supports:

\- procedures to establish, maintain and release NG-RAN part of PDU
sessions;

\- procedures to perform intra-RAT handover and inter-RAT handover;

\- the separation of each UE on the protocol level for user specific
signalling management;

\- the transfer of NAS signalling messages between UE and AMF;

\- mechanisms for resource reservation for packet data streams;

\- procedures to establish, maintain and release NG-RAN part of MBS
sessions.

5 Functions of the NG interface
===============================

5.1 General
-----------

The following clauses describe the functions supported over the NG
interface.

5.2 Paging function 
-------------------

The paging function supports the sending of paging requests to the
NG-RAN nodes involved in the paging area e.g. the NG-RAN nodes of the
TA(s) the UE is registered.

The function also supports CN controlled subgrouping paging for UE Power
Saving.

5.3 UE Context Management function 
----------------------------------

The UE Context management function allows the AMF to establish, modify
or release a UE Context in the AMF and the NG-RAN node e.g. to support
user individual signalling on NG.

The function also enables the AMF to manage RRC state notifications of a
CM-CONNECTED UE.

5.4 Mobility Management function 
--------------------------------

The mobility function for UEs in CM-CONNECTED includes the intra-system
handover function to support mobility within NG-RAN and inter-system
handover function to support mobility from/to EPS system. It comprises
the preparation, execution and completion of handover via the NG
interface.

5.5 PDU Session Management function 
-----------------------------------

The PDU Session function is responsible for establishing, modifying and
releasing the involved PDU sessions NG-RAN resources for user data
transport once a UE context is available in the NG-RAN node.

NGAP supports transparent relaying of PDU Session related information by
the AMF as described in TS 23.502 \[6\].

5.6 NAS Transport function 
--------------------------

The NAS Signalling Transport function provides means to transport or
reroute a NAS message (e.g. for NAS mobility management), or report the
non-delivery of a NAS message for a specific UE over the NG interface.

5.7 NAS Node Selection function
-------------------------------

The interconnection of NG-RAN nodes to multiple AMFs is supported in the
5GS architecture.

Therefore, a NAS node selection function is located in the NG-RAN node
to determine the AMF association of the UE, based on the UE\'s temporary
identifier, which was assigned to the UE by the AMF. When the UE\'s
temporary identifier has not been yet assigned or is no longer valid the
NG-RAN node may instead take into account other information (e.g.
slicing information, onboarding indication) to determine the AMF. When
the NG-RAN node is configured to ensure that the selected AMF serves the
country where the UE is located, as described in TS 23.501 \[8\], the
NG-RAN node takes into account UE location information, if available,
when determining the AMF.

This functionality is located in the NG-RAN node and enables proper
routing via the NG interface. On NG, no specific procedure corresponds
to the NAS Node Selection Function.

5.8 NG Interface Management function 
------------------------------------

The NG-interface management functions provide

\- means to ensure a defined start of NG-interface operation (reset);

\- means to handle different versions of application part
implementations and protocol errors (error indication).

5.9 Warning Message Transmission function 
-----------------------------------------

The warning message transmission function provides means to transfer
warning messages via NG interface or cancel ongoing broadcast of warning
messages. It also provides the capability for the NG-RAN to inform the
AMF that ongoing PWS operation has failed for one or more areas, or that
one or more areas may be reloaded by the CBC.

5.10 Configuration Transfer function 
------------------------------------

The Configuration Transfer function is a generic mechanism that allows
the request and transfer of RAN configuration information (e.g. SON
information) between two RAN nodes via the core network.

5.11 Trace function
-------------------

The Trace function provides means to control trace sessions in the
NG-RAN node.

5.12 AMF Management function
----------------------------

The AMF management function supports AMF planned removal and AMF
auto-recovery as specified in TS 23.501 \[8\].

5.13 Multiple TNL Associations Support Function
-----------------------------------------------

When there are multiple TNL associations between a NG-RAN node and an
AMF, the NG-RAN node selects the TNL association for NGAP signalling
based on the usage and the weight factor of each TNL association
received from the AMF, and uses the TNL association as specified in TS
23.501 \[8\] and TS 23.502 \[6\]. If an AMF releases a TNL association
or a TNL association has failed, the NG-RAN node selects a new one as
specified in TS 23.501 \[8\] and TS 23.502 \[6\].

5.14 AMF Load Balancing function 
--------------------------------

The NG interface supports the indication by the AMF of its relative
capacity to the NG-RAN node in order to achieve load-balanced AMFs
within the pool area.

5.15 Location Reporting function
--------------------------------

This function enables the AMF to request the NG-RAN node to report the
UE\'s current location, or the UE\'s last known location with timestamp,
or the UE\'s presence in a configured area of interest.

5.16 AMF Re-allocation function
-------------------------------

This function allows to redirect an initial connection request issued by
an NG-RAN node from an initial AMF towards a target AMF selected by 5GC.
In this case the NG-RAN node initiates an Initial UE Message procedure
over one NG interface instance and receives the first downlink message
to close the UE-associated logical connection over a different NG
interface instance.

5.17 UE Radio Capability Management function 
--------------------------------------------

The UE Radio Capability Management function is related to the UE radio
capability handling.

5.18 NRPPa Signaling Transport function
---------------------------------------

The NRPPa (NR Positioning Protocol A) Signalling Transport function
provides means to transport an NRPPa (3GPP TS 38.455 \[10\]) message
transparently over the NG interface.

5.19 Overload Control function
------------------------------

The overload function provides means to enable AMF controls the load
that the NG-RAN node(s) are generating.

5.20 Report of Secondary RAT data volumes Function
--------------------------------------------------

The Report of Secondary RAT data volumes Function enables the NG-RAN
node to report Secondary RAT usage data information in case of MR-DC,
either with a dedicated procedure or by including Secondary RAT usage
data information in other messages.

5.21 RIM Information Transfer function 
--------------------------------------

The RIM Information Transfer function is a generic mechanism that allows
the transfer of Remote Interference Management (RIM) information between
two RAN nodes via the core network.

5.22 Retrieve UE Information function
-------------------------------------

The Retrieve UE Information function enables the NG-RAN node to request
UE information (e.g. QoS differentiation information) from the AMF
before the setup of the NG connection for NB-IoT UE(s) using Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimization.

5.23 RAN CP Relocation Indication function
------------------------------------------

The RAN CP Relocation Indication function enables the initiation of the
UE-associated logical NG-connection for a NB-IoT UE using Control Plane
CIoT 5GS Optimisation following a re-establishment request. It allows to
have the re-estabblishment request authenticated by the AMF.

5.24 Suspend-Resume function
----------------------------

This function enables to suspend the UE-associated logical NG-connection
and release the NG-U tunnel while storing the UE context in the NG-RAN
for a faster subsequent resume as specified for User Plane CIoT 5GS
optimizations in TS 23.501 \[8\]. In this version of the specification,
this function only applies for long eDRX cycles.

5.25 Connection Establishment Indication Function
-------------------------------------------------

The connection establishment indication function enables the AMF to
complete the establishment of the UE-associated logical NG-connection.

5.26 AMF CP Relocation Indication Function
------------------------------------------

The AMF CP relocation indication function enables the AMF to inform the
previously serving NG-RAN node that the UE\'s connection is to be
relocated to a new NG-RAN node.

modifying and releasing the involved NR MBS sessions NG-RAN resources
for user data transport once an MBS context is available in the NG-RAN
node.

NGAP supports transparent relaying of MBS Session related information by
the AMF as described in TS 23.247 \[12\].
