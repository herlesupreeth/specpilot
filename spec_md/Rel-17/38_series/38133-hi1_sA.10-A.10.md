A.10 EN-DC Tests with NR PSCell under CCA and Other NR Cells in FR1
===================================================================

*Editor's note: Test cases for EN-DC with NR PSCell under CCA and SCell
under CCA are also included here.*

A.10.1 RRC\_CONNECTED state mobility
------------------------------------

### A.10.1.1 RRC connection mobility control

#### A.10.1.1.1 Random Access

##### A.10.1.1.1.1 4-step RA type contention-based random access for NR PSCell with CCA

###### A.10.1.1.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the behavior of the random
access procedure is according to the requirements and that the PRACH
power settings and timing are within specified limits when subject to
CCA. This test will verify the requirements in clause 6.2.2A.2 and
clause 7.1.2 in an AWGN model.

For this test two cells are used, with the configuration of Cell 1
(E-UTRA PCell) specified in clause A.3.7A.2.1 and Cell 2 configured as
PSCell in FR1. Cell 1 is on a licensed band and cell 2 is subjected to
CCA. Supported test parameters are shown in Table A.10.1.1.1.1.1-1. UE
capable of EN-DC with PSCell in FR1 needs to be tested by using the
parameters in Table A.10.1.1.1.1.1-2.

###### A.10.1.1.1.1.2 Test Requirements

Contention based random access is triggered by *not* explicitly
assigning a random access preamble via dedicated signalling in the
downlink.

####### A.10.1.1.1.1.2.1 Random Access Preamble Transmission

To test the UE behavior specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2.1.1 the System
Simulator shall receive the Random Access Preamble which belongs to one
of the Random Access Preambles associated with the SSB with index 0,
which has SS-RSRP above the configured *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*, if the UL
CCA is successful.

The three requirements below are relevant for all cases of PRACH
transmissions described within the whole clause A.10.1.1.1.1.2:

-   The System Simulator shall implement the UL CCA model of A.3.26.2
    for the RACH occasions where PRACH transmissions are expected. The
    System Simulator shall monitor the RACH occasions to detect if the
    UE is transmitting PRACH preambles. If a PRACH transmission is
    detected on a RACH occasion that is expected to have UL CCA failure,
    the test is considered as failed.

-   In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should verify that the
    UE does not transmit PRACH for semi-static channel access mode; for
    dynamic channel access mode it is assumed that RACH occasions are
    always scheduled within a UE-initiated COT.

-   In case of UL CCA failure, The UE shall again perform the Random
    Access Resource selection procedure specified in clause 5.1.2 in
    TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit with the calculated PRACH transmission
    power.

In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance
with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the first
preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2
of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The relative power applied to additional
preambles shall have an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.3 of TS
38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.1.2.2 Random Access Response Reception

To test the UE behavior specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2.1.2 the System
Simulator shall transmit a Random Access Response containing a Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random
Access Preamble after 5 preambles have been received by the System
Simulator. In response to the first 4 preambles, the System Simulator
shall transmit a Random Access Response *not* corresponding to the
transmitted Random Access Preamble. In case of CCA DL failure, the test
equipment should delay the transmission of Random Access Response.

The UE may stop monitoring for Random Access Response(s) and shall
transmit the msg3 if the Random Access Response contains a Random Access
Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random Access
Preamble if UL CCA is successful. The System Simulator shall monitor if
the UE is transmitting msg3 when CCA UL failure. If a msg3 transmission
is detected on a grant expected to have UL CCA failure, the test is
considered as failed.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2 in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit with
the calculated PRACH transmission power when the backoff time expires if
all received Random Access Responses contain Random Access Preamble
identifiers that do not match the transmitted Random Access Preamble.

In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance
with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the first
preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2
of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The relative power applied to additional
preambles shall have an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.3 of TS
38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.1.2.3 No Random Access Response Reception

To test the UE behavior specified in clause 6.2.2A.2.1.3 the System
Simulator shall transmit a Random Access Response containing a Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random
Access Preamble after 5 preambles have been received by the System
Simulator. The System Simulator shall *not* respond to the first 4
preambles. In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should delay
the transmission of Random Access Response.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2 in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit with
the calculated PRACH transmission power when the backoff time expires if
no Random Access Response is received within the RA Response window.

In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance
with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the first
preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2
of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The relative power applied to additional
preambles shall have an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.3 of TS
38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.1.2.4 Receiving an UL grant for msg3 retransmission

To test the UE behavior specified in clause 6.2.2A.2.1.4, the System
Simulator shall provide an UL grant for msg3 retransmission following a
successful Random Access Response if UL CCA is successful. The System
Simulator shall monitor if the UE is transmitting msg3 when CCA UL
failure. If a msg3 is detected on a grant expected to have UL CCA
failure, the test is considered as failed.

The UE shall re-transmit the msg3 upon the reception of an UL grant for
msg3 retransmission.

####### A.10.1.1.1.1.2.5 Contention Resolution Timer expiry

To test the UE behavior specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2.1.6 the System
Simulator shall *not* send a response to a msg3.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2 in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit with
the calculated PRACH transmission power when the backoff time expires if
the Contention Resolution Timer expires.

##### A.10.1.1.1.2 4-step RA type non-contention based random access for NR PSCell with CCA

###### A.10.1.1.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the behavior of the random
access procedure is according to the requirements and that the PRACH
power settings and timing are within specified limits when subject to
CCA. This test will verify the requirements in clause 6.2.2A.2 and
clause 7.1.2 in an AWGN model.

For this test two cells are used, with the configuration of Cell 1
(E-UTRA PCell) specified in clause A.3.7A.2.1 and Cell 2 configured as
PSCell in FR1. Cell 1 is on a licensed band and cell 2 is subjected to
CCA. Supported test parameters are shown in Table A.10.1.1.1.2.1-1. UE
capable of EN-DC with PSCell in FR1 needs to be tested by using the
parameters in Table A.10.1.1.1.2.1-2.

###### A.10.1.1.1.2.2 Test Requirements

Non-Contention based random access is triggered by explicitly assigning
a random access preamble via dedicated signalling in the downlink. In
the test, the non-contention based random access procedure is not
initialized for Other SI requested from UE or beam failure recovery.

####### A.10.1.1.1.2.2.1 SSB-based Random Access Preamble Transmission

In Test-1, to test the UE behavior specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2.2.1 for
SSB-based Random Access Preamble transmission, with the contention-free
Random Access Resources and the contention-free PRACH occasions
associated with SSBs configured, the System Simulator shall receive the
Random Access Preamble which has the Preamble Index associated with the
SSB with index 0.

The three requirements below are relevant for all cases of PRACH
transmissions described within the whole clause A.10.1.1.1.2.2:

-   The System Simulator shall implement the UL CCA model of A.3.26.2
    for the RACH occasions where PRACH transmissions are expected. The
    System Simulator shall monitor the RACH occasions to detect if the
    UE is transmitting PRACH preambles. If a PRACH transmission is
    detected on a RACH occasion that is expected to have UL CCA failure,
    the test is considered as failed.

-   In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should verify that the
    UE does not transmit PRACH for semi-static channel access mode; for
    dynamic channel access mode it is assumed that RACH occasions are
    always scheduled within a UE-initiated COT.

-   In case of UL CCA failure, The UE shall again perform the Random
    Access Resource selection procedure specified in clause 5.1.2 in
    TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit with the calculated PRACH transmission
    power.

In addition, the System Simulator shall receive the Random Access
Preamble on the PRACH occasion which belongs to the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the SSB with index 0, and the selected PRACH occasion
shall belong to the PRACH occasions permitted by the restrictions given
by the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex*.

In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance
with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the first
preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2
of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The relative power applied to additional
preambles shall have an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.3 of
TS 38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.2.2.2 Random Access Response Reception

To test the UE behavior specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2.2.2 the System
Simulator shall transmit a Random Access Response containing a Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random
Access Preamble after 5 preambles have been received by the System
Simulator. In response to the first 4 preambles, the System Simulator
shall transmit a Random Access Response *not* corresponding to the
transmitted Random Access Preamble. In case of CCA DL failure, the test
equipment should delay the transmission of Random Access Response.

The UE may stop monitoring for Random Access Response(s) if the Random
Access Response contains a Random Access Preamble identifier
corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble if UL CCA is
successful. The System Simulator shall monitor if the UE is transmitting
msg3 when CCA UL failure. If a msg3 is detected on a grant expected to
have UL CCA failure, the test is considered as failed.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2 in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit with
the calculated PRACH transmission power if all received Random Access
Responses contain Random Access Preamble identifiers that do not match
the transmitted Random Access Preamble.

In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance
with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the first
preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2
of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The relative power applied to additional
preambles shall have an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.3 of TS
38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.2.2.3 No Random Access Response Reception

To test the UE behavior specified in clause 6.2.2A.2.2.3 the System
Simulator shall transmit a Random Access Response containing a Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random
Access Preamble after 5 preambles have been received by the System
Simulator. The System Simulator shall *not* respond to the first 4
preambles. In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should delay
the transmission of Random Access Response.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2 in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit with
the calculated PRACH transmission power when the backoff time expires if
no Random Access Response is received within the RA Response window
configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon*.

In addition, the power applied to all preambles shall be in accordance
with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the first
preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2
of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The relative power applied to additional
preambles shall have an accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.3 of TS
38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all PRACH transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

##### A.10.1.1.1.3 2-step RA type contention-based random access for NR PSCell with CCA

###### A.10.1.1.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the behaviour of the random
access procedure is according to the requirements and that the MsgA
PRACH, MsgA PUSCH power settings and timing are within specified limits
when subject to CCA. This test will verify the requirements in
clause 6.2.2A.3 and clause 7.1.2 in an AWGN model.

For this test two cells are used, with the configuration of Cell 1
(E-UTRA PCell) specified in clause A.3.7A.2.1 and Cell 2 configured as
PSCell in FR1. Cell 1 is on a licensed band and cell 2 is subjected to
CCA. Supported test parameters are shown in Table A.10.1.1.1.3.1-1. UE
capable of EN-DC with PSCell in FR1 needs to be tested by using the
parameters in Table A.10.1.1.1.3.1-2.

###### A.10.1.1.1.3.2 Test Requirements

Contention based random access is triggered by *not* explicitly
assigning a random access preamble via dedicated signalling in the
downlink.

####### A.10.1.1.1.3.2.1 MsgA Transmission

To test the UE behaviour specified in Clause 6.2.2A.3.1.1 the System
Simulator shall receive the MsgA with a preamble which belongs to one of
the Random Access Preambles associated with the SSB with index 0, which
has SS-RSRP above the configured *msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB*, if the UL CCA
is successful.

below are relevant for all cases of MsgA transmissions described within
the clause A.10.1.1.1.3.2:

-   The System Simulator shall implement the UL CCA model for the MsgA
    occasions (i.e. both MsgA PRACH and MsgA PUSCH occasions) where MsgA
    transmissions are expected. The System Simulator shall monitor the
    MsgA occasions to detect if the UE is transmitting MsgA. If a MsgA
    transmission is detected on MsgA occasions that are expected to have
    UL CCA failure, the test is considered as failed.

-   In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should verify that the
    UE does not transmit MsgA for semi-static channel access mode; for
    dynamic channel access mode it is assumed that MsgA occasions are
    always scheduled within a UE-initiated COT.

-   The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
    procedure specified in clause 5.1.2a in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit
    with the calculated PRACH transmission power in case of UL CCA
    failure.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2a in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit
with the calculated PRACH transmission power in case of UL CCA failure.
In addition, the power applied to all MsgA transmission shall be in
accordance with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the
first MsgA preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The power of the first MsgA PUSCH
transmission shall be $0.6 + 3\left( \mu + 2 \right)$ dBm with an
accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\], where $\mu$
indicates the MsgA PUSCH numerology. The relative power applied to
additional MsgA transmissions shall have an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all MsgA transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.3.2.2 MsgB Reception

To test the UE behaviour specified in Clause 6.2.2A.3.1.2 the System
Simulator shall transmit a MsgB with fallbackRAR containing a Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted Random
Access Preamble after 5 preambles have been received by the System
Simulator. In response to the first 4 preambles, the System Simulator
shall transmit a MsgB *not* corresponding to the transmitted Random
Access Preamble. In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should
delay the transmission of MsgB.

The UE may stop monitoring for MsgB(s) and shall transmit the msg3 if
the MsgB with a fallbackRAR contains a Random Access Preamble identifier
corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble if UL CCA is
successful. The System Simulator shall monitor if the UE is transmitting
msg3 when CCA UL failure. If a msg3 is detected on a grant expected to
have UL CCA failure, the test is considered as failed.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2a in TS 38.321 \[7\], and transmit
with the calculated MsgA PRACH and MsgA PUSCH transmission power when
the backoff time expires if all received MsgB's contain Random Access
Preamble identifiers that do not match the transmitted Random Access
Preamble .

In addition, the power applied to all MsgA transmission shall be in
accordance with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the
first MsgA preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The power of the first MsgA PUSCH
transmission shall be $0.6 + 3\left( \mu + 2 \right)$ dBm with an
accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\], where $\mu$
indicates the MsgA PUSCH numerology. The relative power applied to
additional MsgA transmissions shall have an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all MsgA transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.3.2.3 No MsgB Reception

To test the UE behavior specified in clause 6.2.2A.3.1.3 the System
Simulator shall transmit a MsgB with fallbackRAR containing a successRAR
message and a Random Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the
transmitted Random Access Preamble after 5 preambles have been received
by the System Simulator. The System Simulator shall *not* respond to the
first 4 preambles. In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should
delay the transmission of MsgB.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2a in TS 38.321 \[7\], and transmit
with the calculated MsgA PRACH and MsgA PUSCH transmission power when
the backoff time expires if no MsgB is received within the MsgB Response
window.

In addition, the power applied to all MsgA transmission shall be in
accordance with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the
first MsgA preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The power of the first MsgA PUSCH
transmission shall be $0.6 + 3\left( \mu + 2 \right)$ dBm with an
accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\], where $\mu$
indicates the MsgA PUSCH numerology. The relative power applied to
additional MsgA transmissions shall have an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all MsgA transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

##### A.10.1.1.1.4 2-step RA type non-contention based random access for NR PSCell with CCA

###### A.10.1.1.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the behavior of the random
access procedure is according to the requirements and that the MsgA
PRACH, MsgA PUSCH power settings and timing are within specified limits
when subject to CCA. This test will verify the requirements in
clause 6.2.2A.3 and clause 7.1.2 in an AWGN model.

For this test two cells are used, with the configuration of Cell 1
(E-UTRA PCell) specified in clause A.3.7.2.1 and Cell 2 configured as
PSCell in FR1. Cell 1 is on a licensed band and cell 2 is subjected to
CCA. Supported test parameters are shown in Table A.10.1.1.1.4.1-1. UE
capable of EN-DC with PSCell in FR1 needs to be tested by using the
parameters in Table A.10.1.1.1.4.1-2.

###### A.10.1.1.1.4.2 Test Requirements

Non-Contention based random access is triggered by explicitly assigning
a random access preamble via dedicated signalling in the downlink. In
the test, the non-contention based random access procedure is not
initialized for Other SI requested from UE or beam failure recovery.

####### A.10.1.1.1.4.2.1 MsgA Transmission

In Test-1, to test the UE behavior specified in Clause 6.2.2A.3.2.1 for
MsgA transmission, with the contention-free Random Access Resources and
the contention-free PRACH occasions associated with SSBs configured, the
System Simulator shall receive the MsgA which has the Preamble Index
associated with the SSB with index 0.

In addition, the System Simulator shall receive the MsgA on the PRACH
occasion which belongs to the PRACH occasions corresponding to the SSB
with index 0, and the selected PRACH occasion shall belong to the PRACH
occasions permitted by the restrictions given first by the
*msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex* if configured, or next by the
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured.

The three requirements below are relevant for all cases of MsgA
transmissions described within the clause A.10.1.1.1.4.2:

-   The System Simulator shall implement the UL CCA model for the MsgA
    occasions (i.e. both MsgA PRACH and MsgA PUSCH occasions) where MsgA
    transmissions are expected. The System Simulator shall monitor the
    MsgA occasions to detect if the UE is transmitting MsgA. If a MsgA
    transmission is detected on MsgA occasions that are expected to have
    UL CCA failure, the test is considered as failed.

-   In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should verify that the
    UE does not transmit MsgA for semi-static channel access mode; for
    dynamic channel access mode it is assumed that MsgA occasions are
    always scheduled within a UE-initiated COT.

-   The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
    procedure specified in clause 5.1.2a in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit
    with the calculated PRACH transmission power in case of UL CCA
    failure.

In addition, the power applied to all MsgA transmission shall be in
accordance with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.2. The power of the
first MsgA preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The power of the first MsgA PUSCH
transmission shall be $0.6 + 3\left( \mu + 2 \right)$ dBm with an
accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\], where $\mu$
indicates the MsgA PUSCH numerology. The relative power applied to
additional MsgA transmissions shall have an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all MsgA transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.4.2.2 MsgB Reception

To test the UE behavior specified in Clause 6.2.2A.3.2.2 the System
Simulator shall transmit a MsgB containing a successRAR MAC subPDU
corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble after 5 MsgA
transmissions have been received by the System Simulator. In response to
the first 4 preambles, the System Simulator shall transmit a MsgB *not*
corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble. In case of CCA
DL failure, the test equipment should delay the transmission of MsgB.

The UE may stop monitoring for MsgB if the MsgB contains a successRAR
MAC subPDU corresponding to the transmitted Random Access Preamble.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2a in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit
with the calculated MsgA transmission power if Random Access Responses
Reception has not been considered as successful.

In addition, the power applied to all MsgA transmissions shall be in
accordance with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.3. The power of the
first MsgA preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The power of the first MsgA PUSCH
transmission shall be $0.6 + 3\left( \mu + 2 \right)$ dBm with an
accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\], where $\mu$
indicates the MsgA PUSCH numerology. The relative power applied to
additional MsgA transmissions shall have an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all MsgA transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

####### A.10.1.1.1.4.2.3 No MsgB Reception

To test the UE behavior specified in clause 6.2.2A.3.2.3 the System
Simulator shall transmit a MsgB corresponding to the transmitted Random
Access Preamble after 5 preambles have been received by the System
Simulator. The System Simulator shall *not* respond to the first 4
preambles. In case of CCA DL failure, the test equipment should delay
the transmission of MsgB.

The UE shall again perform the Random Access Resource selection
procedure specified in clause 5.1.2a in TS38.321 \[7\], and transmit
with the calculated MsgA transmission power when the backoff time
expires if no MsgB is received within the MsgB Response window
configured in *RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA*.

In addition, the power applied to all MsgA transmissions shall be in
accordance with what is specified in Clause 6.2.2A.3. The power of the
first MsgA preamble shall be -16 dBm with an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\]. The power of the first MsgA PUSCH
transmission shall be $0.6 + 3\left( \mu + 2 \right)$ dBm with an
accuracy specified in clause 6.3.4.2 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\], where $\mu$
indicates the MsgA PUSCH numerology. The relative power applied to
additional MsgA transmissions shall have an accuracy specified in
clause 6.3.4.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\].

The transmit timing of all MsgA transmissions shall be within the
accuracy specified in Clause 7.1.2.

#### **A.10.1.2 Handover with PSCell from EN-DC to EN-DC with known target PSCell using CCA**

##### A.10.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#a.10.1.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .list-paragraph}

This test is to verify the requirement for E-UTRA handover with NR
PSCell change, where NR PSCell is on carrier with CCA. The requirements
for EN-DC HO with PSCell change on CCA are specified in clause 5.9 in
E-UTRA RRM specification \[15\] for the case when the target PSCell is
on carrier with CCA. Supported test configurations are shown in table
A.**10.1**.2.1-1.

Table A.10.1.2.1-1 gives general test configurations for Handover with
PSCell from EN-DC to EN-DC, Table A.10.1.2.1-2 provides general test
parameters for Handover from E-UTRA to E-UTRA cell in EN-DC to EN-DC,
Table A.**10.1**.2.1-3 provides E-UTRAN cell specific test parameters
for Handover with PSCell from EN-DC to EN-DC, Table A.**10.1**.2.1-4
provides general test parameters for PSCell change from FR1 carrier
under CCA to FR1 carrier under CCA, Table A.**10.1**.2.1-5 provides cell
specific test parameters for PSCell change from FR1 carrier under CCA to
FR1 carrier under CCA.

In the test there are four cells: Cell1 and Cell2 are PCell and target
PCell on E-UTRA carrier, Cell3 and Cell4 are PSCell and target PSCell on
NR CCA carrier. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
time durations of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Before the test starts the
UE is connected to Cell1 (E-UTRA PCell) and Cell3 (NR PSCell) with EN-DC
mode.

At the start of time duration T1, the UE do not have any information of
cell 2 and cell 4. AT the end of T1, UE is configured with neighbour
cell measurements on the Cell 3 and Cell 4 for Event A3 conditional
measurement report.

During T2, UE acquires the timing information of Cell3 and Cell 4 and
performs L3-RSRP measurements on the configured neighbour cells. UE
sends measurement report to the Cell1 to indicate the event triggering
condition A3 is satisfied for the configured for neighbour cells. By end
of T2, E-UTRA PCell (Cell1) shall send a RRC message implying handover
with PSCell change.

The start of T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
message implying handover with PSCell. UE shall complete PRACH
transmission to PCell and PSCell by end of T3.

##### A.**10.1**.2.2 Test Requirements {#a.10.1.2.2-test-requirements .list-paragraph}

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 60 ms from
the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The handover requirements for handover with PSCell for EN-DC is
defined in clause 5.9 in \[15\] as:

D~HOwithPSCel\_PCell~ = T~RRC\_delay~ + T~search~ + T~IU~ +
T~processing~

Where:

T~RRC\_delay~ = 20 ms for 'RRC connection reconfiguration (NR SCG
establishment/ /modification/release)'.

T~search~ = 0 ms for known cell.

T~IU~ = 15 ms in the test configuration.

T~processing~ = 25ms for source Cell and target Cell are in the same FR.

This gives a total of 60ms for handover delay.

The UE shall transmit the PRACH preamble to Cell 4 less than
D~HOwithPSCell\_PSCell~ from the beginning of time period T3.

NOTE: The PSCell change delay for handover with PSCell for EN-DC is
defined in clause 5.8 in \[15\] as:

D~HOwithPSCell\_PSCell~ = T~RRC\_delay~ + T~processing~ + T~search~ +
T~∆~ + T~IU\_PSCell~ + 2 ms

Where:

T~RRC\_delay~ = 20 ms for 'RRC connection reconfiguration (NR SCG
establishment/ /modification/release)'.

T~processing~ = 25ms for source Cell and target Cell are in the same FR.

T~search~ = 0 ms for known cell.

T~∆~ = (1+ L~2~) \*20 ms.

T~IU~ = (1+ **L~3~**) \*10 + 10 ms

L~2~ is the number of SMTC occasions not available at the UE during the
time tracking period where L~2~ ≤ L~CCA\_DL~, and L~3~ is the number of
consecutive SSB to PRACH occasion association periods during which no
PRACH occasion is available for PRACH transmission due to UL CCA
failure, where L~3~ ≤ L~CCA\_UL~. L~3~ = 0 for Type 2C UL channel access
procedure as defined in TS 37.213 \[33\]. The interruption time
considering the potential extensions caused by L~1~, L~2,~ L~3~ and *by
the UL CCA failure detection/recovery mechanism* is limited by the T304
timer. The UE behaviour at the T304 timer expiry is detailed in TS
38.331 \[2\]. Test equipment should make sure that L~CCA\_DL~ and
L~CCA\_UL~ are not exceeded during a test by monitoring the number of
CCA failures and preventing additional CCA failures from happening after
L~CCA\_DL~ or L~CCA\_UL~ is reached.

The rate of correct PSCell addition observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.

A.10.2 Timing
-------------

### A.10.2.1 UE transmit timing

#### A.10.2.1.1 UE Transmit Timing Test with PSCell under DL CCA

##### A.10.2.1.1.1 Test Purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE can follow frame
timing change of the connected gNodeb when PSCell is subject to DL CCA
and that the UE initial transmit timing accuracy, maximum amount of
timing change in one adjustment, minimum and maximum adjustment rate are
within the specified limits. This test will verify the requirements in

The test consists of E-UTRA PCell and NR PSCell, which is subject to DL
CCA. The configuration for E-UTRA is given in A.3.7.2.1. Table
A.10.2.1.1.1-2 defines the parameters to be configured and strength of
the transmitted signals. The transmit timing is verified by the UE
transmitting SRS using the configuration defined in Table
A.10.2.1.1.1-3.

##### A.10.2.1.1.2 Test requirements

The test sequence shall be carried out in RRC\_CONNECTED for every test
case.

Following will be the test sequence for this test

1\) Set up E-UTRA PCell according to parameters given in Table
A.3.7.2.1-1 and setup NR PSCell according to parameters given in Table
A.10.2.1.1.1-1.

2\) After connection set up with the cell, the test equipment will
verify that the timing of the NR cell is within (N~TA~ +
N~TA\_offset~)×T~c~ ± T~e~ of the first detected path of DL SSB.

a\. The N~TA~ offset value (in T~c~ units) is 25600

b\. The T~e~ values depend on the DL and UL SCS for which the test is
being run and are given in Table 7.1.2-1

3\) The test system shall adjust the timing of the DL path by values
given in Table A.10.2.1.1.2-1

Table A.10.2.1.1.2-1: Adjustment Value for DL Timing

  SCS of SSB signals (kHz)   Adjustment Value   
  -------------------------- ------------------ -------------
                             Test1              Test2
  30                         +32\*64T~c~        +16\*64T~c~

4\) The test system shall verify that the adjustment step size and the
adjustment rate shall be according to requirements specified in Clause
7.1.2 Table 7.1.2.1-1 until the UE transmit timing offset is within
(N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~) ×T~c~ ± T~e~ respective to the first detected
path (in time) of DL SSB. Skip this step for test 2 with DRX configured.

5\) The test system shall verify that the UE transmit timing offset
stays within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~) ×T~c~ ± T~e~ of the first detected
path of DL SSB. For Test 2 the UE transmit timing offset shall be
verified for the first transmission in the DRX cycle immediately after
DL timing adjustment.

### A.10.2.2 UE timing advance

#### A.10.2.2.1 UE Timing Advance Adjustment Accuracy with PSCell under DL CCA

##### A.10.2.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of the test is to verify UE Timing Advance adjustment delay
and accuracy requirement defined in clause 7.3.

##### A.10.2.2.1.2 Test Parameters

Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.2.2.1.2-1. Both
timing advance adjustment delay and accuracy are tested by using the
parameters in table A.10.2.2.1.2-2, A.10.2.2.1.2-3 and A.10.2.2.1.2-4.
The configuration of Cell 1 (LTE PCell) is specified in clause
A.3.7.2.1.

In all test cases, two cells are used. Cell 1 is the PCell in the
primary Timing Advance Group (pTAG) and cell 2 is the PSCell which is
subject to DL CCA is in the secondary Timing Advance Group (sTAG). Each
test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1
and T2 respectively. In each time period, timing advance commands for
sTAG are sent to the UE and Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), as
specified in table A.10.2.2.1.2-3, are sent from the UE and received by
the test equipment. By measuring the reception of the SRS, the transmit
timing, and hence the timing advance adjustment accuracy, can be
measured for PSCell in sTAG.

During time period T1, the test equipment shall send one message with a
Timing Advance Command MAC Control Element for sTAG, as specified in
clause 6.1.3.4 in TS 38.321 \[7\]. The Timing Advance Command value
shall be set to 31, which according to clause 4.2 in TS 38.213 \[3\]
results in zero adjustment of the Timing Advance. In this way, a
reference value for the timing advance for sTAG used by the UE is
established.

During time period T2, the test equipment shall send a sequence of
messages with Timing Advance Command MAC Control Elements for sTAG, with
Timing Advance Command value specified in table A.10.2.2.1.2-2. This
value shall result in changes of the timing advance for sTAG used by the
UE, and the accuracy of the change shall then be measured, using the SRS
sent from the UE.

As specified in clause 7.3.2.1, the UE adjusts its uplink timing at slot
n+k for a timing advance command received in slot n. This delay must be
taken into account when measuring the timing advance adjustment
accuracy, via the SRS sent from the UE.

The UE Time Alignment Timer, described in clause 5.2 in TS 38.321, shall
be configured so that it does not expire in the duration of the test.

##### A.10.2.2.1.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall apply the signalled Timing Advance value for PSCell in sTAG
to the transmission timing at the designated activation time i.e. *k+1*
slots after the reception of the timing advance command, where k=5.

The Timing Advance adjustment accuracy for PSCell in sTAG shall be
within the limits specified in clause 7.3.2.2.

The rate of correct Timing Advance adjustments observed during repeated
tests shall be at least 90%.

A.10.3 Signalling characteristics
---------------------------------

### A.10.3.1 Radio link monitoring

#### A.10.3.1.1 Introduction

In the test cases specified in clause A.10.3.1, any uplink signal
transmitted by the UE is used for detecting the in-/out-of-sync state of
the UE. In terms of measurement, the uplink signal is verified based on
the UE output power:

\- UE output power higher than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as defined in
TS 38.101-3 \[20\]) means uplink signal

\- UE output power equal to or less than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as
defined in TS 38.101-3 \[20\]) means no uplink signal.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, transmit OFF power is
measured as the mean power per component carrier.

For UE with multiple transmit antennas, transmit OFF power is measured
as the mean power at each transmit connector.

#### A.10.3.1.2 Radio link monitoring out-of-sync test for PSCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### A.10.3.1.2.1 Test purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the
out-of-sync and in-sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PSCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 PSCell
radio link monitoring requirements in clause 8.1A.

In the test, UE is configured to perform RLM based on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table A.10.3.1.2.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables A.10.3.1.2.1-2, A.10.3.1.2.1-3, and A.10.3.1.2.1-4 below. There
are two cells in the test: Cell 1 is the E-UTRAN PCell, and Cell 2 is
the FR1 PSCell which operates on a carrier frequency with CCA and
transmits SSBs in DBT windows according to DL CCA model. The E-UTRAN
PCell setting refers to Table A.3.7.2.1-1.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Figure A.10.3.1.2.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the active Cell 2 to emulate
out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration
T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1 and Cell 2. The UE
shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting
periodicity of 5 ms. The UE transmits according to UL CCA model. The UE
is configured to perform inter-frequency measurements using Gap Pattern
ID \#0 (40 ms) in the test.

Figure A.10.3.1.2.1-1: SNR variation for out-of-sync testing.

##### A.10.3.1.2.2 Test requirements

The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3 shall
be as follows:

\- During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall
transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting.

\- The UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time point
C (D1 second after the start of the time duration T3).

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.10.3.1.3 Radio link monitoring in-sync test for PSCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### A.10.3.1.3.1 Test purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the
out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PSCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 PSCell
radio link monitoring requirements in clause 8.1A.

In the test, UE is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table A.10.3.1.3.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables A.10.3.1.3.1-2, and A.10.3.1.3.1-3 below. There are two cells in
the test: Cell 1 is the E-UTRAN PCell, and Cell 2 is the FR1 PSCell
which operates on a carrier frequency with CCA and transmits SSBs in DBT
windows according to DL CCA model. The E-UTRAN PCell setting refers to
Table A.3.7.2.1-1.

The test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.10.3.1.3.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync
and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE
shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The UE shall be configured for
periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5 ms. The UE
transmits according to UL CCA model.

##### A.10.3.1.3.2 Test requirements

The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and
T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least
in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to the
configured periodic CSI reporting.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.10.3.3.1 SCell Activation and Deactivation of known NR SCell with NR PSCell and NR SCell under CCA, 160 ms SCell measurement cycle

##### A.10.3.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that SCell activation and
deactivation delays for NR SCell, with NR PSCell and NR SCell both under
CCA, are within the requirements stated in clause 8.3A, when the SCell
is known by the UE at the time of activation and the configured SCell
measurement cycle is 160 ms.

The supported test configurations are shown in Table A.10.3.3.1.1-1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.10.3.3.1.1-2 and cell-specific
parameters for NR cells are provided in Table A.10.3.3.1.1-3 below.
Cell-specific parameters for EUTRA PCell are provided in clause
A.3.7.2.1.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with duration of T1,
T2 and T3, respectively. There are three carriers, each with one cell:
Cell 1 (PCell) on radio channel 1 (PCC) in E-UTRA, Cell 2 (PSCell) on
radio channel 2 (PSCC) in NR, and Cell3 (SCell) on radio channel 3 (SCC)
in NR. Before the test starts the UE is connected to Cell 1 and Cell 2,
but is not aware of Cell 3, as the UE is only monitoring PCC and PSCC.
The UE shall be continuously scheduled in the PCell and PSCell
throughout the whole test.

At the beginning of T1 the UE receives an RRC message by which the SCell
(Cell 3) becomes configured on radio channel 2. The UE now starts
monitoring the SCC. At the end of T1, the test equipment sends a MAC
message for activation of the SCell.

The point in time at which the MAC message is received at the UE antenna
connector, in a slot \# denoted *m*, defines the start of time period
T2. The UE shall be able to report a valid CSI in PSCell for the
activated SCell at latest in slot *m* + (T~HARQ~+
T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ +
T~CSI\_Reporting\_withCCA~)/NR\_slot\_length, as defined in clause
8.3A.2. The UE shall start reporting CSI in PSCell in first available
uplink resource for CSI reporting after at least one CSI-RS transmission
occasion for channel measurement and reporting following slot *m+*
$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3\text{ms}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$ and shall
report CQI index 0 (out-of-range) until the SCell activation has been
completed. Any PSCell interruption shall fall within the time window
specified in clause 8.3A.2.

The point in time at which the MAC message is received by at the UE
antenna connector, in a slot \# denoted *n*, defines the start of time
period T3. The UE shall complete the activation at latest in slot
$n + \frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3\text{ms}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$. Any
PSCell interruption shall fall within the time window specified in
clause 8.3A.3.

The test equipment verifies that potential interruption is carried out
in the correct time span by monitoring ACK/NACK sent in PSCell during
activation and deactivation of SCell, respectively.

The test equipment verifies the activation time by counting the slots
from the time when the SCell activation command is sent until a CSI
report with other than CQI index 0 is received, while taking into
account CCA failures on SCC.

The test equipment verifies the deactivation time by counting the slots
from the time when the SCell deactivation command is sent until CQI
reporting for SCell is discontinued.

### A.10.3.4 Beam failure detection and link recovery procedures

#### A.10.3.4.1 EN-DC Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PSCell configured with SSB-based BFD and LR in non-DRX mode

##### A.10.3.4.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects
SSB-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving PSCell
and that the UE performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam
candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for
beam failure detection within the UEs active DL BWP of the PSCell,
during the evaluation period, and link recovery, when no DRX is used.
This test will partly verify the SSB based beam failure detection and
link recovery for an FR1 serving cell requirements in clause 8.5A.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.10.3.4.1.1-1, A.10.3.4.1.1-2,
and A.10.3.4.1.1-3 below. There are two cells, cell 1 is the E-UTRAN
PCell, and cell 2 is the PSCell which operates on a carrier frequency
with CCA and transmits SSBs in DBT windows according to DL CCA model.
The test consists of five successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.10.3.4.1.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR of the PCell and the SNR of the SSB in set
q~0~ in the active PSCell to emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure
A.10.3.4.1.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1 and cell 2. The UE shall be configured for
periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. The UE

Figure A.10.3.4.1.1-1: SNR and L1-RSRP variation SSB for SSB-based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing in non-DRX mode

##### A.10.3.4.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall be as
follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the UE shall transmit uplink signal
at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell 1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the UE shall detect beam failure and initiate link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the UE measures and evaluate beam candidate from beam
candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 410 ms after the
start of T5, the UE shall transmit preamble on a beam associated with
the candidate beam set q~1~. The UE shall not transmit preamble on a
beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time point
B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the UE. The rate of correct events observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

#### A.10.3.4.2 EN-DC Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PSCell configured with SSB-based BFD and LR in DRX mode

##### A.10.3.4.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects
SSB-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving PSCell
and that the UE performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam
candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for
beam failure detection within the UEs active DL BWP of the PSCell,
during the evaluation period, and link recovery, when DRX is used. This
test will partly verify the SSB based beam failure detection and link
recovery for an FR1 serving cell requirements in clause 8.5A.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.10.3.4.2.1-1, A.10.3.4.2.1-2,
and A.4.5.5.2.1-3 below. There are two cells, cell 1 is the E-UTRAN
PCell, and cell 2 is the PSCell which operates on a carrier frequency
with CCA and transmits SSBs in DBT windows according to DL CCA model, in
the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.10.3.4.2.1-1
shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the PCell and the SNR of the
SSB in set q~0~ in the active PSCell to emulate SSB based beam failure.
Figure A.10.3.4.2.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink
L1-RSRP of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link
recovery. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be
fully synchronized to cell 1 and cell 2. The UE shall be configured for
periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. The UE
transmits the reporting according to UL CCA model. In the test, DRX
configuration is enabled in PSCell and DRX inactivity timer has already
been expired, i.e. UE tries to decode PDCCH and to send periodic CQI
during the period when On-duration timer is running. Time alignment
timers shall be set to "infinity" so that UL timing alignment is
maintained during the test.

failure detection and link recovery testing in DRX mode

##### A.10.3.4.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall be as
follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the UE shall transmit uplink signal
at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell 1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the UE shall detect beam failure and initiate link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the UE measures and evaluate beam candidate from beam
candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 3850 ms after
the start of T5, the UE shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The UE shall not transmit preamble on
a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the UE. The rate of correct events observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

### A.10.3.5 Active BWP switching

#### A.10.3.5.1 UL active BWP switch delay with consistent UL LBT failure on PSCell subject to UL CCA in EN-DC

A.10.3.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the UL BWP switch delay
requirement defined in clause 8.6.4.

The supported test configurations are shown in Table A.**10.3.5.1**.1-1.

The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA PCell (Cell 1), and one NR
PSCell (Cell 2) as given in A.**10.3.5.1**.1-2. Cell-specific parameters
of E-UTRA PCell are specified in Table A.3.7.2.1-1 and Cell-specific
parameters of NR PSCell is specified in Table A.**10.3.5.1**.1-2. SRS
configuration used in the test is specified in Table A.10.3.5.1.1-4.

The UE shall be configured with PRACH configuration on UL BWP on which
the UE shall switch after the consistent UL LBT failure detection.

Before the test starts,

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 on radio channel 1 and Cell 2 on radio
channel 2.

\- UE is configured with 2 different UE-specific downlink and uplink
bandwidth parts on Cell 2: DL BWP-1, DL BWP-2, UL BWP-1 and UL BWP-2
before starting the test. DL BWP-1 and DL BWP-2 always include bandwidth
of the initial DL BWP and SSB. UL BWP-1 and UL BWP-2 always include
bandwidth of the SRS.

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is DL BWP-1.

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* that the active UL BWP
is UL BWP-1.

\- UE is configured with *LBT-FailureRecoveryConfig* parameters for Cell
2.

The cell has constant signal levels throughout the test. The test
consists of 2 successive time periods, with durations of T1 and T2,
respectively.

During T1,

\- Time period T1 starts when the UE has received the SRS configuration
for periodic SRS transmission on active UL BWP-1.

\- The UE shall perform UL CCA before SRS transmission.

\- The parameter UL CCA probability P~CCA~ is set to 0 during T1. This
requires the test system to set energy level above the detection level
during portion of the UL slot where the UE performs UL CCA. This in turn
forces the UE to fail the UL CCA. The UE consistently fails UL CCA
during T1 and is therefore unable to transmit SRS.

During T2,

\- T2 starts when the UE detects consistent UL LBT failures i.e. when
total number of UL LBT failures in Cell 2 on active UL BWP-1 exceeds
*lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount* during *lbt-FailureDetectionTimer.*

\- The UE upon detected consistent UL LBT failure starts the LBT
recovery mechanism, which requires the UE to switch to active UL BWP-2
in Cell 2 and to send PRACH in the active UL BWP-2.

\- Staring from T2, the UE shall be able to send PRACH in the active UL
BWP-2 within the delay specified in clause 8.6.4.

##### A.10.3.5.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE capable of *bwp-SwitchingDelay* *type1* \[2\] shall start to
transmit the PRACH on active UL BWP-2 of Cell 2 (PSCell) less than 21.5
ms from the beginning of time period T1.

The UE capable of *bwp-SwitchingDelay* *type2* \[2\] shall start to
transmit the PRACH on active UL BWP-2 of Cell 2 (PSCell) less than 23 ms
from the beginning of time period T1.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The above delay is calculated as follows:'

The active UL BWP switch delay from UL BWP-1 to UL BWP-2 can be
expressed as:

T~BWPswitchDelay~\*T~slot~ +1\*T~slot~ + (1+ **L~3~**)\*T~SSB,RO~ + 10
ms

Where:

\- T~BWPswitchDelay~ = 1 ms (2 slots) and 2.5 ms (5 slots) for
*bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\] *type1* and *type2* UE capabilities according
to clause 8.6.4.

\- T~slot~ = It is the slot length. It is 0.5 ms for 30 kHz.

\- L3 = It is the number of consecutive SSB to PRACH occasion
association periods during which no PRACH occasion is available for
PRACH transmission due to UL CCA failure. L3= 0 during T2 since P~CCA~ =
1.

\- T~SSB,RO~ = 10 ms according to FR1 PRACH configuration 1.

This gives a total of 21.5 ms and 23 ms for *type1* and *type2* UE
respectively.

#### A.10.3.5.2 DCI-based and Timer-based Active BWP Switch

##### A.10.3.5.2.1 E-UTRAN -- NR PSCell FR1 DL active BWP switch in non-DRX in synchronous EN-DC

##### A.10.3.5.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#a.10.3.5.2.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify the DL BWP switch delay
requirement defined in TS38.133 clause 8.6, and interruption requirement
for E-UTRA victim cell defined in TS36.133 clause 7.32.2.7. Supported
test configurations are shown in Table A.10.3.5.2**.1**.1-1.

The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA PCell (Cell 1), and one NR
PSCell (Cell 2) as given in Table A.10.3.5.2**.1**.1-2. Cell-specific
parameters of E-UTRA PCell are specified in Table A.3.7.2.1-1 and
Cell-specific parameters of NR PSCell is specified in Table
A.10.3.5.2**.1**.1-3 below.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on PCell
(Cell 1) to ensure that the UE will have ACK/NACK sending.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on PSCell
(Cell 2) to ensure that the UE would have ACK/NACK sending except for
the time duration when BWP is switching on Cell 2 and the time duration
of T2.

Before the test starts,

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 (PCell) on radio channel 1 (PCC), and Cell
2 (PSCell) on radio channel 2 (PSCC).

\- UE is configured with 2 different UE-specific downlink bandwidth
parts for PSCell, BWP-1 and BWP-2, in Cell 2 before starting the test.
BWP-1 and BWP-2 always include bandwidth of the initial DL BWP and SSB.

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is BWP-1 in PSCell.

\- UE is configured with a *bwp-InactivityTimer* timer value for PSCell.

All cells have constant signal levels throughout the test.

The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with durations of T1,
T2, and T3, respectively.

During T1,

Time period T1 starts when a DCI format 1\_1 command for PSCell DL BWP
switch, sent from the test equipment to the UE, is received at the UE
side in PSCell's slot \# denoted *i*. The UE shall switch its bandwidth
part from BWP-1 to BWP-2.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH at the beginning of the DL slot
right after PSCell's DL slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*) as defined in
clause 8.6 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for the PSCell no later
than at the beginning of the DL slot right after DL slot
(*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*). The UE shall be continuously scheduled on
PSCell's BWP-2 starting from the beginning of the DL slot right after DL
slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*).

The starting time of PCell(Cell 1) interruption due to BWP switch on
PSCell shall occur within the BWP switch delay.

During T2, the test equipment won't transmit DCI format for PDSCH
reception on PSCell(Cell 2).

During T3,

The time period T3 starts from the slot \#*j*, where j is the beginning
slot of the DL subframe immediately after the *bwp-InactivityTimer*
timer expires. The UE shall switch its bandwidth part from BWP-2 back to
the default bandwidth part -- BWP-1.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH at the beginning of the DL slot
right after PSCell's DL slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*) as defined in
clause 8.6 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for the PSCell at latest
at the beginning of the DL slot right after DL slot
(*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*). The UE shall be continuously scheduled on
PSCell's BWP-1 starting from the beginning of the DL slot right after DL
slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*).

The starting time of PCell(Cell 1) interruption due to BWP switch of
PSCell shall occur within the BWP switch delay.

The test equipment verifies the DL BWP switch time in PSCell by counting
the slots from the time when the BWP switch command is received or
*bwp-InactivityTimer* timer expires till an ACK is received.

The test equipment verifies that potential interruption to E-UTRA PCell
is carried out in the correct time span by monitoring ACK/NACK sent in
PCell during BWP switch of PSCell, respectively.

##### A.10.3.5.2**.1.**2 Test Requirements {#a.10.3.5.2.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

During T1, the UE shall start to send the ACK for PSCell in the DL slot
right after DL slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*).

During T3, the UE shall start to send the ACK for PSCell in the DL slot
right after DL slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*).

Where, *k1* is the timing between DL data receiving and acknowledgement
as specified in \[7\].

Depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\], UE shall finish
BWP switch within the time duration *T~BWPswitchDelay~* defined in Table
8.6.2-1.

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed PSCell active BWP switch delay to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

During T1, the start time of PCell interruption during PSCell active BWP
switch shall not happen outside the BWP switch delay.

During T3, the start time of PCell interruption of during PSCell active
BWP switch shall not happen outside the BWP switch delay.

The interruption of PCell shall not be longer than the interruption
duration specified for active BWP switch in TS36.133 Clause 7.32.2.7.

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed PCell active BWP switch interruption to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: During T1, T3 if there are no uplink resources for reporting the
ACK in the DL slot right after DL slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*),
(*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*), then the UE shall use the next available
uplink resource for reporting the corresponding ACK.

##### A.10.3.5.2.2 E-UTRAN -- NR PSCell FR1 DL active BWP switch with FR1 SCell in non-DRX in synchronous EN-DC

##### A.10.3.5.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#a.10.3.5.2.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify the DL BWP switch delay
requirement defined in clause 8.6, and interruption requirements for NR
victim cell defined in clause 8.2.1.2.7 and interruption requirement for
E-UTRA victim cell defined in clause 7.32.2.7 of TS 36.133 \[15\].
Supported test configurations are shown in Table A.10.3.5.2.2.1-1.

The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA PCell (Cell 1), one NR PSCell
(Cell 2) and one NR SCell (Cell 3) as given in Table A.10.3.5.2.2.1-2.
Cell-specific parameters of E-UTRA PCell are specified in Table
A.3.7.2.1-1 and Cell-specific parameters of NR PSCell and SCell are
specified in Table A.10.3.5.2.2.1-3 below.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on PCell
(Cell 1) and SCell (Cell 3) to ensure that the UE will have ACK/NACK
sending.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on PSCell
(Cell 2) to ensure that the UE would have ACK/NACK sending except for
the time duration when BWP is switching on Cell 2 and the time duration
of T2.

Before the test starts,

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 (PCell) on radio channel 1 (PCC), Cell 2
(PSCell) on radio channel 2 (PSCC) and Cell 3 (SCell) on radio channel 3
(SCC).

\- UE is configured with 2 different UE-specific downlink bandwidth
parts for PSCell, BWP-1 and BWP-2, in Cell 2 before starting the test.
BWP-1 and BWP-2 always include bandwidth of the initial DL BWP and SSB.

\- UE is configured with 1 UE-specific downlink bandwidth parts the same
as initial BWP for SCell, BWP-0 in Cell 3 before starting the test.

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is BWP-1 in PSCell.

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is BWP-0 in SCell.

\- UE is configured with a *bwp-InactivityTimer* timer value for PSCell.

All cells have constant signal levels throughout the test.

The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with durations of T1,
T2, and T3, respectively.

During T1,

Time period T1 starts when a DCI format 1\_1 command for PSCell DL BWP
switch, sent from the test equipment to the UE, is received at the UE
side in PSCell's slot \# denoted *i*. The UE shall switch its bandwidth
part from BWP-1 to BWP-2.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH at the beginning of the DL slot
right after PSCell's DL slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*) as defined in
clause 8.6 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for the PSCell no later
than at the beginning of the DL slot right after slot
(*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*). The UE shall be continuously scheduled on
PSCell's BWP-2 starting from the beginning of the DL slot right after
slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*).

PCell(Cell 1) interruption due to BWP switch on PSCell shall occur
within the BWP switch delay.

SCell(Cell 3) interruption due to BWP switch on PSCell shall occur
within the BWP switch delay.

During T2, the test equipment won't transmit DCI format for PDSCH
reception on PSCell(Cell 2).

During T3,

The time period T3 starts from the slot \#*j*, where j is the beginning
slot of the DL subframe immediately after the slot wherein
*bwp-InactivityTimer* timer expires. The UE shall switch its bandwidth
part from BWP-2 back to the default bandwidth part -- BWP-1.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH at the beginning of the DL slot
right after PSCell's DL slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*) as defined in
clause 8.6 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for the PSCell at latest
at the beginning of the DL slot right after slot
(*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*). The UE shall be continuously scheduled on
PSCell's BWP-1 starting from the beginning of the DL slot right after
slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*).

PCell(Cell 1) interruption due to BWP switch of PSCell shall occur
within the BWP switch delay.

SCell(Cell 3) interruption due to BWP switch of PSCell shall occur
within the BWP switch delay.

The test equipment verifies the DL BWP switch time in PSCell by counting
the slots from the time when the BWP switch command is received or
*bwp-InactivityTimer* timer expires till an ACK is received.

The test equipment verifies that potential interruption to E-UTRA PCell
and NR SCell is carried out in the correct time span by monitoring
ACK/NACK sent in PCell and SCell during BWP switch of PSCell,
respectively.

##### A.10.3.5.2.2.2 Test Requirements {#a.10.3.5.2.2.2-test-requirements .H6}

During T1, the UE shall start to send the ACK for PSCell in the DL slot
right after slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*).

During T3, the UE shall start to send the ACK for PSCell in the DL slot
right after slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k11*).

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed PSCell active BWP switch delay to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

During T1, the start of the interruption of PCell during PSCell active
BWP switch shall not happen outside the BWP switch delay.

During T3, the start of the interruption of PCell during PSCell active
BWP switch shall not happen outside the BWP switch delay.

The interruption of PCell shall not be longer than the interruption
duration specified for active BWP switch in clause 7.32.2.7 of
TS 36.133 \[15\].

During T1, the start of the interruption of SCell during PSCell active
BWP switch shall not happen outside the BWP switch delay.

During T3, the start of the interruption of SCell during PSCell active
BWP switch shall not happen outside the BWP switch delay.

The interruption of SCell shall not be longer than the interruption
duration specified for active BWP switch in clause 8.6.2.

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed PCell active BWP switch interruption to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: During T1, T3 if there are no uplink resources for reporting the
ACK in the DL slot right after slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*),
(*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*), then the UE shall use the next available
uplink resource for reporting the corresponding ACK.

*Editor's note: FFS value of k1 for type 1 and type 2 UE.*

#### A.10.3.5.3 RRC-based Active BWP Switch

##### A.10.3.5.3.1 E-UTRAN -- NR PSCell FR1 DL active BWP switch in non-DRX in synchronous EN-DC

##### A.10.3.5.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#a.10.3.5.3.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify the DL BWP switch delay
requirement for RRC-based BWP switch defined in clause 8.6.3. Supported
test configurations are shown in Table A.10.3.5.3.1.1-1.

The test scenario comprises of one E-UTRA PCell (Cell 1) and one NR
PSCell (Cell 2) as given in Table A.10.3.5.3.1.1-2. Cell-specific
parameters of E-UTRA PCell are specified in Table A.3.7.2.1-1 and
Cell-specific parameters of NR PSCell are specified in Table
A.10.3.5.3.1.1-3 below.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on PCell
(Cell 1) to ensure that the UE will have ACK/NACK sending.

Before the test starts,

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 (PCell) on radio channel 1 (PCC) and to
Cell 2 (PSCell) on radio channel 2 (PSCC).

\- UE has bandwidth part BWP-1 in its RRC-configuration for Cell 1
(PSCell).

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is BWP-1 of initial condition in PSCell.

All cells have constant signal levels throughout the test.

The test consists of 1 time period, with duration of T1.

During T1,

Time period T1 starts when a *RRCReconfiguration* with updated bandwidth
part configuration, sent from the test equipment to the UE, is
completely received at the UE side in PSCell's slot \# denoted *i*. The
UE shall reconfigure its bandwidth part with the updated bandwidth part
BWP-1 of final condition.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH at the beginning of the DL slot
right after PSCell's DL slot
(*i+T~RRCprocessingDelay~+T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~*) as defined in clause
8.6.3 and be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the PSCell no
later than at the beginning of the DL slot right after slot
(*i+T~RRCprocessingDelay~+T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~*). The UE shall be
continuously scheduled on PSCell's BWP-1 starting from the beginning of
the DL slot right after slot
(*i+T~RRCprocessingDelay~+T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~*).

*T~RRCprocessingDelay\ ~*and *T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~* are defined in
clause 8.6.3.

The test equipment verifies the DL BWP switch time in PSCell by counting
the time from the time when the RRC Reconfiguration message including
updated BWP configurationis sent till the time when RRC Reconfiguration
Complete message is received.

##### A.10.3.5.3.1.2 Test Requirements {#a.10.3.5.3.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

During T1, the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for
PSCell in the beginning of the DL slot right after slot (*i+
T~RRCprocessingDelay~+T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~* ).

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed PSCell active BWP switch delay to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.10.3.6 PSCell addition and release delay

#### A.10.3.6.1 Addition and Release Delay of known NR PSCell on the carrier under CCA

##### A.10.3.6.1.1 Test purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NR PSCell addition and
release delays on the carrier under CCA under EN-DC are within the
requirements stated in clause 7.31A.2 \[15\] for the case when the
PSCell is known by the UE at the time of addition.

Supported test configurations are shown in A.10.3.6.1.1-1. The test
parameters for the E-UTRA cell are given in Table A.3.7.2.1-1. The
E-UTRA cell once set up is not changed across time.

The test parameters for NR cell are given in Tables A.10.3.6.1.1-2 and
cell-specific parameters in A.10.3.6.1.1-3 below. The test consists of
five successive time periods with duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
respectively. There are two carriers each with one cell. Before the test
starts the UE is connected to Cell 1 (E-UTRA PCell) on radio channel 1
(PCC) but is not aware of Cell 2 (NR PSCell) on radio channel 2. The UE
is only monitoring the PCC. During T1 only Cell1 is known to the UE.

Before the start of T2, the UE in the measurement control information
that event-triggered reporting with Event B1 is configured for neighbour
cell (Cell2). Before the start of T2 the UE is configured with the
measurement gaps (gap pattern Id \# 0). The Cell2 becomes known to the
UE during T2. Therefore, during T2 the UE shall report Event B1. The
point in time at which the RRC message to release measurement gap is
transmitted from the test system defines the start of period T3. During
T3, after measurement gap is released, the test system transmits the RRC
message to the UE to add PSCell on radio channel 2.

The RRC message (to add PSCell) also includes a request for the UE to
start periodic CSI reporting for the PSCell after the PSCell has been
successfully added. The point in time at which the RRC message to add
PSCell (Cell2) is received at the UE antenna connector defines the start
of period T4.

The test system shall observe the periodic reporting of CSI for PSCell
during T5. The point in time at which the UE has sent PRACH to the
PSCell (Cell 2) defines the start of period T5.

The test system shall send a RRC message to the UE to release PSCell
(Cell 2) on radio channel 2. The RRC message to release PSCell (Cell2)
shall be sent to the UE during period T5, after the UE has sent at least
one CQI report with non-zero CQI index for PSCell (Cell 2). The point in
time at which the RRC message to release PSCell (Cell2) is received at
the UE antenna connector defines the start of period T6.

##### A.10.3.6.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall transmit the PRACH to PSCell at latest
T~config\_PSCell\_withCCA~ ^Note1^ into T4.

The UE shall send at least one CSI report for PSCell with non-zero CQI
index during T5.

The UE shall periodically send CSI reports for PSCell after the UE has
sent first CQI report with non-zero CQI index during T5

The UE shall stop sending CSI reports for PSCell in at latest 20 ms into
T6.

All the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed PSCell addition delay and PSCell release delay to be counted as
correct. The rate of correct observed PSCell addition delay and PSCell
release delay during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

Note1: The PSCell addition delay can be expressed as **follows as
specified in clause 7.31A.2 \[15\]**:

T~config\_PSCell\_withCCA~ = T~RRC\_delay~ + T~processing~ +
T~search\_withCCA~ + T~∆\_withCCA~ + T~PSCell\_\ DU\_withCCA~ + 2 ms

Where:

T~RRC\_delay~ = 20 ms

T~processing~ = 20 ms

T~search\_withCCA~ = 0

T~∆\_withCCA~ = (1+ L~2~)\*20 ms

T~PSCell\_\ DU\_withCCA~ = 20 ms.

> L~2~ is the number of SMTC occasions not available at the UE for fine
> time tracking and acquiring full timing information, where L~2~ ≤
> L~CCA\_DL~.

A.10.4 Measurement procedure
----------------------------

### A.10.4.1 Intra-frequency measurements

#### A.10.4.1.1 Event-triggered reporting tests on PSCC without gaps under non-DRX

##### A.10.4.1.1.1 Test purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the intra-frequency
cell search requirements in clauses 9.2A.5.1 and 9.2A.5.2.

##### A.10.4.1.1.2 Test parameters

Three cells are deployed in the test, which are E-UTRAN PCell (Cell 1)
and two cells on the same carrier frequency with CCA transmitting SSBs
in DBT windows according to DL CCA model: PSCell (Cell 2) and a
neighbour cell (Cell 3). The test parameters for the three cells are
given in Table A.10.4.1.1.2-1 and A.10.4.1.1.2-2 below. In the
measurement control information, a measurement object is configured for
the frequency of the PSCell, and it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2,
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of Cell 3.

##### A.10.4.1.1.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE is not required to read the neighbour cell SSB index
in this test. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports,
as long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

T~identify\_intra\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_cca~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2A.5.1-1.

> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2A.5.2-1.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.1.2 Void

#### A.10.4.1.3 Void

#### A.10.4.1.4 Event-triggered reporting tests on PSCC with per-UE gaps under DRX

##### A.10.4.1.4.1 Test purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the intra-frequency
cell search requirements in clauses 9.2A.6.1 and 9.2A.6.2.

##### A.10.4.1.4.2 Test parameters

Three cells are deployed in the test, which are E-UTRAN PCell (Cell 1)
and two cells on the same carrier frequency with CCA transmitting SSBs
in DBT windows according to DL CCA model: PSCell (Cell 2) and a
neighbour cell (Cell 3). The test parameters for the three cells are
given in Table A.10.4.1.4.2-1, A.10.4.1.4.2-2 and A.10.4.1.4.2-3 below.
In the measurement control information, a measurement object is
configured for the frequency of the PSCell, and it is indicated to the
UE that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1 and
T2, respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any
timing information of Cell 3.

There are two BWPs configured in Cell 2, BWP1 which contains the cell
defining SSB, and BWP2 which does not contain any SSB of Cell 2. During
the whole test, BWP2 is always scheduled as the active BWP for the UE.

UE needs to be provided with new Timing Advance Command MAC control
element at least once during each time alignment timer period to
maintain uplink time alignment. Furhtermore UE is allocated with PUSCH
resource at every DRX cycle.

##### 

##### A.10.4.1.4.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE is not required to read the neighbour cell SSB index
in this test. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports,
as long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

T~identify\_intra\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_cca~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2A.6.1-1.

> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2A.6.2-1.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.3 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 with CCA cell without SSB time index detection when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters and configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.3.1-1,
A.10.4.2.3.1-2, and A.10.4.2.3.1-3.

In this test measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in
Table A.10.4.2.3.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.3.1-1.

##### A.10.4.2.3.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE is not required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.
>
> MGRP = 40 ms.

SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.4 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 cell with CCA without SSB time index detection when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.2.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters and configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.4.1-1,
A.10.4.2.4.1-2, and A.10.4.2.4.1-3.

In test 1&2 measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in
Table A.10.4.2.4.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.4.1-1.

UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer
to keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore, UE is allocated with
PUSCH resource at every DRX cycle.

##### A.10.4.2.4.2 Test Requirements

In test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 1 and 2, the UE is not required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.
>
> MGRP = 40 ms.
>
> For test 1, DRX cycle = 40 ms and for test 2, DRX cycle = 640 ms.
>
> SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.5 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 cell with CCA with SSB time index detection when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.2.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters and configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.5.1-1,
A.10.4.2.5.1-2, and A.10.4.2.5.1-3.

In this test, measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in
Table A.10.4.2.5.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.5.1-1.

##### A.10.4.2.5.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ from the beginning of time period
T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 1, the UE is required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

> T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used to acquire
> the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3A.4-2.
>
> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.
>
> MGRP = 40 ms.

SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.6 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 cell with CCA with SSB time index detection when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.2.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters and configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.6.1-1,
A.10.4.2.6.1-2, and A.10.4.2.6.1-3.

In test 1&2 measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in
Table A.10.4.2.6.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.6.1-1.

UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer
to keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore, UE is allocated with
PUSCH resource at every DRX cycle.

##### A.10.4.2.6.2 Test Requirements

In test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_~from the beginning of time period T2. The
UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_~from the beginning of time period T2. The
UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 1 and 2, the UE is required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3A.4-2.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement period
of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.

MGRP = 40 ms.

For test 1, DRX cycle = 40 ms and for test 2, DRX cycle = 640 ms.

SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.7 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 cell without SSB time index detection when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.2.7.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 on NR RF channel 2. The test parameters
and configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.7.1-1, A.10.4.2.7.1-2,
and A.10.4.2.7.1-3.

In test 1 measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in Table
A.10.4.2.7.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.7.1-1.

##### A.10.4.2.7.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE is not required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.
>
> MGRP = 40 ms.

SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.8 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 cell without SSB time index detection when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.2.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 on NR RF channel 1 and NR cell 3
as neighbour cell in FR1 on NR RF channel 2. The test parameters and
configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.8.1-1, A.10.4.2.8.1-2, and
A.10.4.2.8.1-3.

In test 1&2 measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in
Table A.10.4.2.8.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.8.1-1.

UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer
to keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore, UE is allocated with
PUSCH resource at every DRX cycle.

##### A.10.4.2.8.2 Test Requirements

In test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 1 and 2, the UE is not required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.
>
> MGRP = 40 ms.
>
> For test 1, DRX cycle = 40 ms and for test 2, DRX cycle = 640 ms.
>
> SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.9 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 cell with SSB time index detection when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.2.9.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 on NR RF channel 1 and NR cell 3
as neighbour cell in FR1 on NR RF channel 2. The test parameters and
configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.9.1-1, A.10.4.2.9.1-2, and
A.10.4.2.9.1-3.

In test 1 measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in Table
A.10.4.2.9.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.9.1-1.

##### A.10.4.2.9.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ from the beginning of time period
T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE is required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

> T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used to acquire
> the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3A.4-2.
>
> T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.
>
> MGRP = 40 ms.

SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.2.10 EN-DC event triggered reporting tests for FR1 cell with SSB time index detection when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.2.10.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the EN-DC
inter-frequency NR cell search requirements in clause 9.3A.4 and 9.3A.5.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 on NR RF channel 1 and NR cell 3
as neighbour cell in FR1 on NR RF channel 2. The test parameters and
configurations are given in Tables A.10.4.2.10.1-1, A.10.4.2.10.1-2, and
A.10.4.2.10.1-3.

In test 1&2 measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in
Table A.10.4.2.10.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists of
two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of NR cell 3.

The configuration of LTE cell 1 is defined in table A.3.7.2.1-1.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.4.2.10.1-1.

UE needs to be provided at least once every 500ms with new Timing
Advance Command MAC control element to restart the Time alignment timer
to keep UE uplink time alignment. Furthermore, UE is allocated with
PUSCH resource at every DRX cycle.

##### A.10.4.2.10.2 Test Requirements

In test 1, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_~from the beginning of time period T2. The
UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 2, the UE shall send one Event A3 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_~from the beginning of time period T2. The
UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 1 and 2, the UE is required to report SSB time index.

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~) ms, where

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3A.4-2.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement period
of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.

MGRP = 40 ms.

For test 1, DRX cycle = 40 ms and for test 2, DRX cycle = 640 ms.

SMTC period = 20 ms.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

### A.10.4.3 L1-RSRP measurements for beam reporting

#### A.10.4.3.1 SSB based L1-RSRP measurement on PSCC when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of L1-RSRP measurement. This test will partly verify the
L1-RSRP measurement requirements in clause 9.5A.4.1, with the testing
configurations for NR cells in Table A.10.4.3.1.1-1.

##### A.10.4.3.1.2 Test parameters

There are two cells in the test, E-UTRAN Pcell (Cell 1) and FR1 PSCell
(Cell 2) which operates on a carrier frequency with CCA and transmits
SSBs in DBT window according to DL CCA model. The test parameters and
applicability for Cell 1 are defined in A.3.7A.2. The test parameters
for the Cell 2 are given in Table A.10.4.3.1.2-1 and Table
A.10.4.3.1.2-2 below.

In CSI measurement configuration, UE is indicated to perform L1-RSRP
measurement on the SSBs and report periodically. The UE transmits the
reporting according to UL CCA model. The test consists of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2 respectively. The test has
higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements*
configured*.*

The same test is applicable for UE supporting any one or both
semi-static channel access or dynamic channel access and for network
configuring any of semi-static channel occupancy or dynamic channel
occupancy.

There is no measurement gap configured in the test. Before the test, UE
is configured to perform RLM, BFD and L1-RSRP measurement based on the
SSBs.

##### A.10.4.3.1.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report every 80 slots. No later than 640 ms
plus 80 slots from the beginning of time period T2, UE shall send
L1-RSRP report including results of both SSB0 and SSB1 while meeting the
absolute accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.1 and relative
accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.2. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report of both SSB0 and SSB1 in Cell 2.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.3.2 SSB based L1-RSRP measurement on PSCC when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of L1-RSRP measurement. This test will partly verify the
L1-RSRP measurement requirements in clause 9.5A.4.1, with the testing
configurations for NR cells in Table A.10.4.3.1.1-1.

##### A.10.4.3.2.2 Test parameters

There are two cells in the test, E-UTRAN Pcell (Cell 1) and FR1 PSCell
(Cell 2) which operates on a carrier frequency with CCA and transmits
SSBs in DBT window according to DL CCA model. The test parameters and
applicability for Cell 1 are defined in A.3.7A.2. The test parameters
for the Cell 2 are given in Table A.10.4.3.2.2-1 and Table
A.10.4.3.2.2-2 below.

In CSI measurement configuration, UE is indicated to perform L1-RSRP
measurement on the SSBs and report periodically. The UE transmits the
reporting according to UL CCA model. The test consists of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2 respectively. The test has
higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements*
configured*.*

The same test is applicable for UE supporting any one or both
semi-static channel access or dynamic channel access and for network
configuring any of semi-static channel occupancy or dynamic channel
occupancy.

There is no measurement gap configured in the test. Before the test, UE
is configured to perform RLM, BFD and L1-RSRP measurement based on the
SSBs.

##### A.10.4.3.2.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report every 80 slots. No later than 640 ms
plus 80 slots from the beginning of time period T2, UE shall send
L1-RSRP report including results of both SSB0 and SSB1 while meeting the
absolute accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.1 and relative
accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.2. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report of both SSB0 and SSB1 in Cell 2.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.3.3 SSB based L1-RSRP measurement on SCC when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of L1-RSRP measurement. This test will partly verify the
L1-RSRP measurement requirements in clause 9.5A.4.1, with the testing
configurations for NR cells in Table A.10.4.3.1.1-1.

##### A.10.4.3.3.2 Test parameters

There are three cells in the test, E-UTRAN PCell (Cell 1), FR1 PSCell
(Cell 2), and FR1 SCell (Cell 3). Cell 2 and Cell 3 operate on a carrier
frequency with CCA and transmits SSBs in DBT window according to DL CCA
model. The test parameters and applicability for Cell 1 are defined in
A.3.7A.2. The test parameters for the Cell 2 and Cell 3 are given in
Table A.10.4.3.3.2-1 and Table A.10.4.3.3.2-2 below.

In CSI measurement configuration, UE is indicated to perform L1-RSRP
measurement on the SSBs and report periodically. The UE transmits the
reporting according to UL CCA model. The test consists of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2 respectively. The test has
higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements*
configured*.*

The same test is applicable for UE supporting any one or both
semi-static channel access or dynamic channel access and for network
configuring any of semi-static channel occupancy or dynamic channel
occupancy.

There is no measurement gap configured in the test. Before the test, UE
is configured to perform RLM, BFD and L1-RSRP measurement based on the
SSBs.

##### A.10.4.3.3.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report every 80 slots. No later than 640 ms
plus 80 slots from the beginning of time period T2, UE shall send
L1-RSRP report including results of both SSB0 and SSB1 while meeting the
absolute accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.1 and relative
accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.2. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report of both SSB0 and SSB1 in Cell 3.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.3.4 SSB based L1-RSRP measurement on SCC when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.3.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of L1-RSRP measurement. This test will partly verify the
L1-RSRP measurement requirements in clause 9.5A.4.1, with the testing
configurations for NR cells in Table A.10.4.3.4.1-1.

##### A.10.4.3.4.2 Test parameters

There are three cells in the test, E-UTRAN PCell (Cell 1), FR1 PSCell
(Cell 2), and FR1 SCell (Cell 3). Cell 2 and Cell 3 operate on a carrier
frequency with CCA and transmits SSBs in DBT window according to DL CCA
model. The test parameters and applicability for Cell 1 are defined in
A.3.7A.2. The test parameters for the Cell 2 and Cell 3 are given in
Table A.10.4.3.4.2-1 and Table A.10.4.3.4.2-2 below.

In CSI measurement configuration, UE is indicated to perform L1-RSRP
measurement on the SSBs and report periodically. The UE transmits the
reporting according to UL CCA model. The test consists of two successive
time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2 respectively. The test has
higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements*
configured*.*

The same test is applicable for UE supporting any one or both
semi-static channel access or dynamic channel access and for network
configuring any of semi-static channel occupancy or dynamic channel
occupancy.

There is no measurement gap configured in the test. Before the test, UE
is configured to perform RLM, BFD and L1-RSRP measurement based on the
SSBs.

##### A.10.4.3.4.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report every 80 slots. No later than 640 ms
plus 80 slots from the beginning of time period T2, UE shall send
L1-RSRP report including results of both SSB0 and SSB1 while meeting the
absolute accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.1 and relative
accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.19.1.2. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE shall send L1-RSRP report of both SSB0 and SSB1 in Cell 3.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

### A.10.4.4 E-UTRAN−NR inter-RAT measurements on NR carrier frequency under CCA

#### A.10.4.4.1 E-UTRA-NR inter-RAT event triggered reporting tests for FR1 without SSB time index detection when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.4.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the NR inter-RAT
cell search requirements in clause 8.1.2.4.21A of TS 36.133 \[15\] for
E-UTRAN FDD-NR measurements under CCA and clause 8.1.2.4.22A of
TS 36.133 \[15\] for E-UTRAN TDD-NR measurements under CCA.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters are given in Tables A.10.4.4.1.1-1, A.10.4.4.1.1-2,
A.10.4.4.1.1-3 and A.10.4.4.1.1-4. Cell transmits SSBs in DBT windows
according to DL CCA model.

In this test, measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in
Table A.10.4.4.1.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event B2 (PCell becomes worse than
threshold1 and inter RAT neighbour becomes better than threshold2)
\[16\] is used. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the
UE shall not have any timing information of NR cell 3.

##### A.10.4.4.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_irat\_cca\_without\_index~ ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE is not required to report SSB time index.
T~identify\_irat\_cca\_without\_index~ is defined in defined in clause
8.1.2.4.21A.1 and 8.1.2.4.22A.1 in TS 36.133.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.4.2 E-UTRA-NR inter-RAT event triggered reporting tests for FR1 without SSB time index detection when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.4.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the NR inter-RAT
cell search requirements in clause 8.1.2.4.21 of TS 36.133 \[15\] for
E-UTRAN FDD-NR measurements and clause 8.1.2.4.22 of TS 36.133 \[15\]
for E-UTRAN TDD-NR measurements.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters are given in Tables A.10.4.4.2.1-1, A.10.4.4.2.1-2,
A.10.4.4.2.1-3 and A.10.4.4.2.1-4. Cell transmits SSBs in DBT windows
according to DL CCA model.

In tests 1 and 2, measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined
in Table A.10.4.4.2.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event B2 (PCell becomes worse than
threshold1 and inter RAT neighbour becomes better than threshold2)
\[16\] is used. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the
UE shall not have any timing information of NR cell 3.

##### A.10.4.4.2.2 Test Requirements

In test, the UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_irat\_cca\_without\_index~ ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 2, the UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_irat\_cca\_without\_index~ ms from the beginning of time
period T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct
events observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In tests 1 and 2, the UE is not required to report SSB time index.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.4.3 NR Inter-RAT event triggered reporting tests for FR1 with SSB time index detection when DRX is not used

##### A.10.4.4.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the NR inter-RAT
cell search requirements in clause 8.1.2.4.21of TS 36.133 \[15\] for
E-UTRAN FDD-NR measurements and clause 8.1.2.4.22 of TS 36.133 \[15\]
for E-UTRAN TDD-NR measurements.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters are given in Tables A.10.4.4.3.1-1, A.10.4.4.3.1-2,
A.10.4.4.3.1-3 and A.10.4.4.3.1-4. Cell transmits SSBs in DBT windows
according to DL CCA model.

In test 1 measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined in Table
A.10.4.4.3.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event B2 (PCell becomes worse than
threshold1 and inter RAT neighbour becomes better than threshold2)
\[16\] is used. In the measurement configuration the UE shall be
indicated to report the SSB index of the identified NR cell. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and
T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any
timing information of NR cell 3.

##### A.10.4.4.3.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_irat\_cca\_with\_index~ ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

The UE is required to report SSB time index.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.10.4.4.4 NR Inter-RAT event triggered reporting tests for FR1 with SSB time index detection when DRX is used

##### A.10.4.4.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the NR inter-RAT
cell search requirements in clause 8.1.2.4.21of TS 36.133 \[15\] for
E-UTRAN FDD-NR measurements and clause 8.1.2.4.22 of TS 36.133 \[15\]
for E-UTRAN TDD-NR measurements.

In this test, there are three cells: LTE cell 1 as PCell on E-UTRA RF
channel 1, NR cell 2 as PSCell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 1 and NR
cell 3 as neighbour cell in FR1 with CCA on NR RF channel 2. The test
parameters are given in Tables A.10.4.4.4.1-1, A.10.4.4.4.1-2,
A.10.4.4.4.1-3 and A.10.4.4.4.1-4. Cell transmits SSBs in DBT windows
according to DL CCA model.

In tests 1 and 2, measurement gap pattern configuration \# 0 as defined
in Table A.10.4.4.4.1-2 is provided.

In the measurement control information, it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event B2 (PCell becomes worse than
threshold1 and inter RAT neighbour becomes better than threshold2)
\[16\] is used. In the measurement configuration the UE shall be
indicated to report the SSB index of the identified NR cell. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and
T2 respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any
timing information of NR cell 3.

##### A.10.4.4.4.2 Test Requirements

In test 1, the UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_irat\_cca\_with\_index~ ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In test 2, the UE shall send one Event B2 triggered measurement report,
with a measurement reporting delay less than
T~identify\_irat\_cca\_with\_index~ ms from the beginning of time period
T2. The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

In tests 1 and 2, the UE is required to report SSB time index.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

### A.10.5.1 SS-RSRP

#### A.10.5.1.1 Intra-frequency measurement accuracy on a CCA serving cell

##### A.10.5.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SS-RSRP measurement
accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in clause 10.1.36.1.1 and 10.1.36.1.2 when the serving cell
is subject to CCA.

##### A.10.5.1.1.2 Test parameters

In this set of test cases there are two cells in the test, E-UTRAN PCell
(Cell 1), FR1 PSCell under CCA (Cell 2). Cell 2 operates on a carrier
frequency with CCA and transmits SSBs in DBT window according to DL CCA
model. Supported test configurations are shown in Table A.10.5.1.1.1-1.
Both absolute and relative accuracy of SS-RSRP intra-frequency
measurements are tested by using the parameters in Table A.10.5.1.1.1-2.
The configuration of cell 1 (E-UTRA PCell) is specified in clause
A.3.7A.2.1. In all test cases, Cell 2 is the PSCell, and Cell 3 is the
target cell.

##### A.10.5.1.1.3 Test Requirements

The SS-RSRP measurement accuracy for cell 2 and cell 3 shall fulfil
absolute requirement in clause 10.1.2.1.1 and relative requirement in
clause 10.1.36.1.1 and 10.1.36.1.2.

#### A.10.5.1.2 Inter-frequency measurement accuracy with FR1 CCA serving cell and FR1 CCA target cell

##### A.10.5.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SS-RSRP measurement
accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in clauses 10.1.37.1.1 and 10.1.37.1.2 for inter-frequency
measurements with the testing configurations in Table A.10.5.1.2.1-1.

  Note: The UE is only required to be tested in one of the supported test configurations on each supported band   

##### A.10.5.1.2.2 Test parameters

In this set of test cases there are three cells in the test, E-UTRAN
PCell (Cell 1), FR1 PSCell (Cell 2) and a FR1 neighbour cell (Cell 3) on
a different frequency than the PSCell. The test parameters and
applicability for Cell 1 are defined in A.3.7A.2.1. The test parameters
for the Cell 2 and Cell 3 are given in Table A.10.5.1.2.2-1 below. Both
absolute and relative accuracy of RSRP inter-frequency measurements are
tested by using the parameters in Table A.10.5.1.2.2-1. The
inter-frequency measurements are supported by a measurement gap.

##### A.10.5.2.1.3 Test Requirements

The SS-RSRQ measurement accuracy shall fulfil the requirements in clause
10.1.29.1.1.

#### **A.10.5.2.2 Inter-frequency measurement accuracy with FR1 CCA serving cell and FR1 CCA target cell**

##### A.10.5.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SS-RSRQ measurement
accuracy is within the specified limitsThis test will verify the
requirements in clause 10.1.30.1.1 and 10.1.30.1.2 for inter-frequency
measurements with the testing configurations in Table A.10.5.2.2.2-1.

##### A.10.5.2.2.2 Test Parameters

In this set of test cases there are three cells in the test, E-UTRAN
PCell (Cell 1), FR1 PSCell (Cell 2) and a FR1 neighbour cell (Cell 3) on
a different frequency than the PSCell. The test parameters and
applicability for Cell 1 are defined in A.3.7.2. The test parameters for
the Cell 2 and Cell 3 are given in Table A.4.7.1.2.2-1 below. Both
absolute and relative accuracy of RSRP inter-frequency measurements are
tested by using the parameters in Table A.10.5.2.2.2-2. The
inter-frequency measurements are supported by a measurement gap.

##### A.10.5.2.2.3 Test Requirements

The SS-RSRQ measurement accuracy shall fulfil the requirements in clause
10.1.30.1.1 and 10.1.30.1.2.

### A.10.5.3 SS-SINR

#### A.10.5.3.1 Intra-frequency measurement accuracy on PSCC

##### A.10.5.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SS-SINR measurement
accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in clause 10.1.31.1.

##### A.10.5.3.1.2 Test Parameters

In this test case all cells are on the same carrier frequency. Supported
test configuration are shown in Table A.10.5.3.1.2-1. The absolute
accuracy of SS-SINR intra-frequency measurement is tested by using the
parameters in Table A.10.5.3.1.2-2. The configuration of cell 1 (E-UTRA
PCell) is specified in clause A.3.7A.2.1. In all test cases, Cell 2 is
the PSCell with CCA and Cell 3 is the target cell with CCA. Two
sub-tests (Test 1 and Test 2) are provided different N~oc~ on Cells 2
and 3.

##### A.10.5.3.1.3 Test Requirements

The SS-SINR measurement accuracy shall fulfil the requirements in clause
10.1.31.1.1.

#### A.10.5.3.2 Inter-frequency measurement accuracy on PSCC

##### A.10.5.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SS-SINR measurement
accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in clause 10.1.32.1.1 and 10.1.32.1.2 for inter-frequency
measurement.

##### A.10.5.3.2.2 Test Parameters

In this test case the two NR cells (i.e., Cell 2 and Cell 3) are on
different carrier frequencies and measurement gaps are provided.
Supported test configurations are shown in Table A.10.5.3.2.2-1. Both
absolute accuracy and relative accuracy requirements of SS-SINR
inter-frequency measurement are tested by using test parameters in Table
A.10.5.3.2.2-2. In all test cases, Cell 2 is the PSCell with CCA and
Cell 3 is target cell with CCA. Cell 1 is the E-UTRA cell of which
specific test parameters for this test case are specified in Table
A.3.7A.2.1-1. Three sub-tests (Test 1, Test 2 and Test 3) are provided
different N~oc~ on Cells 2 and 3.

##### A.10.5.4.1.2 Test parameters

In this set of test cases there are two cells in the test, E-UTRAN PCell
(Cell 1), FR1 PSCell under CCA (Cell 2). Cell 2 operates on a carrier
frequency with CCA and transmits SSBs in DBT window according to DL CCA
model.

Two sub-tests (Test 1 and Test 2) are provided with different
*N~oc\ ~*on Cell 2. The test parameters and applicability for Cell 1 are
defined in A.3.7A.2. The test parameters for the Cell 2 are given in
Table A.10.5.4.1.2-1 below. The absolute and relative accuracy of
L1-RSRP measurements are tested by using the parameters in Table
A.10.5.4.1.2-1.

The same test is applicable for UE supporting any one or both
semi-static channel access or dynamic channel access and for network
configuring any of semi-static channel occupancy or dynamic channel
occupancy.

There is no measurement gap configured in the test. Before the test, UE
is configured one SSB resource set with two SSB resources. UE is
configured to perform RLM, BFD and L1-RSRP measurement based on the SSB
resources 0 and 1.

In both Test 1 and Test 2, the L1-RSRP measurement accuracy for SSB\#0
and SSB\#1 of Cell 2 shall fulfil the requirements in clauses 10.1.33.1.

### A.10.5.5 RSSI

#### A.10.5.5.1 RSSI measurement accuracy on PSCC with CCA

##### A.10.5.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the RSSI measurement accuracy
is within the specified limits. This test will partially verify the RSSI
measurement accuracy requirements in Section 10.1.34.1.

##### A.10.5.5.1.2 Test parameters

In all test cases, Cell 1 is E-UTRAN PCell on a licensed band, and Cell
2 is PSCell operating on a carrier frequency under CCA. RSSI is measured
on channel number 1. Supported test configurations are shown in table
A.10.5.5.1.2-1. The accuracy of RSSI intra-frequency measurements is
tested by using the parameters in A.10.5.5.1.2-2 and A.10.5.5.1.2-3. The
E-UTRAN PCell setting refers to Table A.3.7.2.1-1.

##### A.10.5.5.1.3 Test Requirements

The average RSSI measurement accuracy shall fulfil the requirements in
sections 10.1.34.1. The nominal RSSI used to evaluate the requirement
shall be based on Io in slots corresponding to RSSI measurement time
configuration (RMTC).

#### A.10.5.5.2 RSSI measurement accuracy on SCC with CCA

##### A.10.5.5.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the RSSI measurement accuracy
is within the specified limits. This test will partially verify the RSSI
measurement accuracy requirements in Section 10.1.34.1.

##### A.10.5.5.2.2 Test parameters

In all test cases, Cell 1 is E-UTRAN PCell on a licensed band, Cell 2 is
PSCell operating on a carrier frequency under CCA, Cell 3 is SCell on a
carrier frequency under CCA. RSSI is measured on channel number 2.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.5.5.2.2-1. The
accuracy of RSSI intra-frequency measurements is tested by using the
parameters in A.10.5.5.2.2-2 and A.10.5.5.2.2-3. The E-UTRAN PCell
setting refers to Table A.3.7.2.1-1.

##### A.10.5.5.2.3 Test Requirements

The average RSSI measurement accuracy shall fulfil the requirements in
sections 10.1.34.1. The nominal RSSI used to evaluate the requirement
shall be based on Io in slots corresponding to RSSI measurement time
configuration (RMTC).

#### A.10.5.5.3 Inter-frequency RSSI measurement accuracy on a carrier with CCA 

##### A.10.5.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the RSSI measurement accuracy
is within the specified limits. This test will partially verify the RSSI
measurement accuracy requirements in Section 10.1.34.2.

##### A.10.5.5.3.2 Test parameters

In all test cases, Cell 1 is E-UTRAN PCell on a licensed band, Cell 2 is
PSCell operating on a carrier frequency under CCA, and Cell 3 is the
neighbour with CCA. RSSI is measured on channel number 2. Supported test
configurations are shown in table A.10.5.5.3.2-1. The accuracy of RSSI
inter-frequency measurements is tested by using the parameters in
A.10.5.5.3.2-2 and A.10.5.5.3.2-3. The E-UTRAN PCell setting refers to
Table A.3.7.2.1-1.

##### A.10.5.5.3.3 Test Requirements

The average RSSI measurement accuracy shall fulfil the requirements in
sections 10.1.34.2. The nominal RSSI used to evaluate the requirement
shall be based on Io in slots corresponding to RSSI measurement time
configuration (RMTC).

### A.10.5.6 Channel occupancy

#### A.10.5.6.1 Channel occupancy measurement accuracy on PSCC with CCA

##### A.10.5.6.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the channel occupancy
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will
partially verify the channel occupancy measurement accuracy requirements
in Section 10.1.35.1.

##### A.10.5.6.1.2 Test parameters

In all test cases, Cell 1 is E-UTRAN PCell on a licensed band, and Cell
2 is PSCell operating on a carrier frequency under CCA. Channel
occupancy is measured on channel number 1. Supported test configurations
are shown in table A.10.5.6.1.2-1. The accuracy of channel occupancy
intra-frequency measurements is tested by using the parameters in
A.10.5.6.1.2-2 and A.10.5.6.1.2-3. The E-UTRAN PCell setting refers to
Table A.3.7.2.1-1.

##### A.10.5.6.1.3 Test Requirements

The nominal reported *channelOccupancy s*hall be 100%. At least 90% of
channel occupancy reports made by the UE shall indicate this value.

#### A.10.5.6.2 Channel occupancy measurement accuracy on SCC with CCA

##### A.10.5.6.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the channel occupancy
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will
partially verify the channel occupancy measurement accuracy requirements
in Section 10.1.35.1.

##### A.10.5.6.2.2 Test parameters

In all test cases, Cell 1 is E-UTRAN PCell on a licensed band, Cell 2 is
PSCell operating on a carrier frequency under CCA, Cell 3 is SCell on a
carrier frequency under CCA. Channel occupancy is measured on channel
number 2. Supported test configurations are shown in table
A.10.5.6.2.2-1. The accuracy of channel occupancy intra-frequency
measurements is tested by using the parameters in A.10.5.6.2.2-2 and
A.10.5.6.2.2-3. The E-UTRAN PCell setting refers to Table A.3.7.2.1-1.

##### A.10.5.6.2.3 Test Requirements

The nominal reported *channelOccupancy s*hall be 100%. At least 90% of
channel occupancy reports made by the UE shall indicate this value.

#### A.10.5.6.3 Inter-frequency channel occupancy measurement accuracy on a carrier with CCA 

##### A.10.5.6.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the channel occupancy
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will
partially verify the channel occupancy measurement accuracy requirements
in Section 10.1.35.2.

##### A.10.5.6.3.2 Test parameters

In all test cases, Cell 1 is E-UTRAN PCell on a licensed band, Cell 2 is
PSCell operating on a carrier frequency under CCA, and Cell 3 is the
neighbour with CCA. Channel occupancy is measured on channel number 2.
Supported test configurations are shown in table A.10.5.6.3.2-1. The
accuracy of channel occupancy inter-frequency measurements is tested by
using the parameters in A.10.5.6.3.2-2 and A.10.5.6.3.2-3. The E-UTRAN
PCell setting refers to Table A.3.7.2.1-1.
