Foreword
========

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

This document captures the findings from the study item \"Study on
support of reduced capability NR devices\" \[2\].

The study includes identification and study of potential UE complexity
reduction techniques and UE power saving and battery lifetime
enhancements for reduced capability UEs in applicable use cases,
functionality that will enable the performance degradation of such
complexity reduction to be mitigated or limited, principles for how to
define and constrain such reduced capabilities, and functionality that
will allow devices with reduced capabilities to be explicitly
identifiable to networks and networks operators and allow operators to
restrict their access if desired.

The scope of the study includes support for all FR1/FR2 bands for FDD
and TDD and coexistence with Rel-15/16 UEs. This study focuses on SA
mode and single connectivity. The scope of the study does not include
LPWA use cases.

identified area is *time sensitive communication* (TSC). In particular,
mMTC, URLLC and TSC are associated with novel IoT use cases that are
targeted in vertical industries. It is envisaged that eMBB, mMTC, URLLC
and TSC use cases may all need to be supported in the same network.

In the 3GPP study on \"*self-evaluation towards IMT-2020 submission*\"
it was confirmed that NB-IoT and LTE-MTC (a.k.a. eMTC) fulfil the
IMT-2020 requirements for mMTC and can be certified as 5G technologies.
For URLLC support, URLLC features were introduced in Release 15 for both
LTE and NR, and NR URLLC is further enhanced in Release 16 within the
enhanced URLLC (eURLLC) and Industrial IoT work items. Rel-16 also
introduced support for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and 5G
integration for TSC use cases.

1\. One important objective of 5G is to enable connected industries. 5G
connectivity can serve as catalyst for next wave of industrial
transformation and digitalization, which improve flexibility, enhance
productivity and efficiency, reduce maintenance cost, and improve
operational safety. Devices in such environment include e.g. pressure
sensors, humidity sensors, thermometers, motion sensors, accelerometers,
actuators, etc. It is desirable to connect these sensors and actuators
to 5G radio access and core networks. The massive industrial wireless
sensor network (IWSN) use cases and requirements described in TR 22.804,
TS 22.104, TR 22.832 and TS 22.261 include not only URLLC services with
very high requirements, but also relatively low-end services with the
requirement of small device form factors, and/or being completely
wireless with a battery life of several years. The requirements for
these services are higher than LPWA (i.e. LTE-MTC/NB-IoT) but lower than
URLLC and eMBB.

2\. Similar to connected industries, 5G connectivity can serve as
catalyst for the next wave smart city innovations. As an example, TR
22.804 describes smart city use case and requirements for that. The
smart city vertical covers data collection and processing to more
efficiently monitor and control city resources, and to provide services
to city residents. Especially, the deployment of surveillance cameras is
an essential part of the smart city but also of factories and
industries.

3\. Finally, wearables use case includes smart watches, rings, eHealth
related devices, and medical monitoring devices etc. One characteristic
for the use case is that the device is small in size.

As a baseline, the requirements for these three use cases are:

Generic requirements:

\- Device complexity: Main motivation for the new device type is to
lower the device cost and complexity as compared to high-end eMBB and
URLLC devices of Rel-15/Rel-16. This is especially the case for
industrial sensors.

\- Device size: Requirement for most use cases is that the standard
enables a device design with compact form factor.

\- Deployment scenarios: System should support all FR1/FR2 bands for FDD
and TDD.

Use case specific requirements:

1\. Industrial wireless sensors: Reference use cases and requirements
are described in TR 22.832 and TS 22.104: Communication service
availability is 99.99% and end-to-end latency less than 100 ms. The
reference bit rate is less than 2 Mbps (potentially asymmetric e.g. UL
heavy traffic) for all use cases and the device is stationary. The
battery should last at least few years. For safety related sensors,
latency requirement is lower, 5-10 ms (TR 22.804)

2\. Video Surveillance: As described in TR 22.804, reference economic
video bitrate would be 2-4 Mbps, latency \< 500 ms, reliability
99%-99.9%. High-end video e.g. for farming would require 7.5-25 Mbps. It
is noted that traffic pattern is dominated by UL transmissions.

3\. Wearables: Reference bitrate for smart wearable application can be
5-50 Mbps in DL and 2-5 Mbps in UL and peak bit rate of the device
higher, up to 150 Mbps for downlink and up to 50 Mbps for uplink.
Battery of the device should last multiple days (up to 1-2 weeks).

The intention is to study a UE feature and parameter list with lower end
capabilities, relative to Release 16 eMBB and URLLC NR to serve the
three use cases mentioned above.

5 Study objectives
==================

The study includes the following objectives:

1\) Identify and study potential UE complexity reduction features,
including \[RAN1, RAN2\]:

\- Potential features:

\- Reduced number of UE RX/TX antennas

\- UE bandwidth reduction

\- Half-duplex FDD

\- Relaxed UE processing time

\- Relaxed UE processing capability

\- Notes:

\- Rel-15 SSB bandwidth should be reused and L1 changes minimized.

\- The work defined above should not overlap with LPWA use cases.

\- The lowest data rate and bandwidth capability considered should be no
less than an LTE Category 1bis modem.

\- The study includes evaluations of the impact to coverage, network
capacity and spectral efficiency.

2\) Study UE power saving and battery lifetime enhancement for reduced
capability UEs in applicable use cases (e.g. delay tolerant) \[RAN2,
RAN1\]:

\- Reduced PDCCH monitoring by smaller numbers of blind decodes and CCE
limits \[RAN1\].

\- Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle \[RAN2\]

\- RRM relaxation for stationary devices \[RAN2\]

3\) Study functionality that will enable the performance degradation of
such complexity reduction to be mitigated or limited, including
\[RAN1\]:

\- Coverage recovery to compensate for potential coverage reduction due
to the device complexity reduction.

\- For FR1, coverage analysis for wearables can include consideration of
potential reduced antenna efficiency due to device size limitations as
part of the antenna gains. The extent of additional recovery of coverage
loss due to reduced antenna efficiency is to be limited to 3 dB.

\- The study includes evaluations of the impact to network capacity and
spectral efficiency.

\- Note: Potential overlap with the Coverage Enhancement SI \[5\] is
discussed and resolved in RAN plenary.

4\) Study standardization framework and principles for how to define and
constrain such reduced capabilities -- considering definition of a
limited set of one or more device types and considering how to ensure
those device types are only used for the intended use cases \[RAN2,
RAN1\].

5\) Study functionality that will allow devices with reduced
capabilities to be explicitly identifiable to networks and network
operators, and allow operators to restrict their access, if desired
\[RAN2, RAN1\].

Additional notes:

\- Coexistence with Rel-15 and Rel-16 UE should be ensured.

\- This SI should focus on SA mode and single connectivity.

6 Evaluation methodology
========================

6.1 Evaluation methodology for UE complexity reduction
------------------------------------------------------

For cost/complexity evaluation of UE complexity reduction techniques,
the methodology used in TR 36.888 \[4\] was used as a starting point.

Reference NR devices were defined as follows for FR1 FDD, FR1 TDD and
FR2, respectively.

\- All mandatory Rel-15 features (with or without capability signaling)

\- Single RAT

\- Operation in a single band at a time

\- Maximum bandwidth:

\- For FR1: 100 MHz for DL and UL

\- For FR2: 200 MHz for DL and UL

\- Antennas:

\- For FR1 FDD: 2Rx/1Tx

\- For FR1 TDD: 4Rx/1Tx

\- For FR2: 2Rx/1Tx

\- Power class: PC3

\- Processing time: Capability 1

\- Modulation:

\- For FR1: support 256QAM for DL and 64QAM for UL

\- For FR2: support 64QAM for DL and 64QAM for UL

\- Access: Direct DL/UL access between UE and gNB

Detailed cost breakdown for the reference NR devices according to Table
6.1-1 was assumed in the study. The RF-to-baseband cost ratio was
assumed to be 40:60 for an FR1 UE and 50:50 for an FR2 UE.

The study considered impacts on cost/complexity reduction from the
studied UE complexity reduction techniques for a UE that supports
multiple RF bands through operation in a single band at a time, where it
was assumed that support of multiple RF bands may affect the RF cost but
not the baseband cost significantly.

NOTE: This study assesses, from a 3GPP standpoint, the technical
feasibility of reduced-capability NR devices for industrial wireless
sensors, video surveillance and wearables use cases. Given that factors
outside 3GPP responsibility influence the cost of a modem/device, this
study item (and this study report) cannot guarantee, or be used as a
guarantee, that such modem/device will be low-cost in the market.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

In addition to the assumptions in Table 6.2-1, the following additional
assumptions are considered for UE power saving evaluations:

\- The scaling factor \'0.7\' is used for 2 Rx to 1Rx power scaling.

\- The power scaling for PDCCH candidate reduction defined in TR 38.840
\[6\] is reused for RedCap UEs.

\- For FR2, the power consumption model in TR 38.840 \[6\] is reused.

The following rules for power determination are adopted as working
assumption for power saving evaluations:

\- Rule 1: \'Micro sleep\' power of 1 Rx is \[0.8\]x2 Rx \'Micro sleep\'
power

\- Rule 2: For both 1 Rx and 2 Rx configuration, P(α) = max
(Micro-sleep, α ∙ Pt + (1 -- α) ∙ 0.7Pt)), where Pt is the PDCCH-only
power for same slot and cross-slot scheduling cases

**Traffic model used for UE power saving evaluation:**

For instant messaging, Heartbeat and VoIP application, the following
traffic models and DRX configuration in Table 6.2-2 and Table 6.2-3 are
used as baseline for evaluations.

For capturing the observations on power saving results in clause 8.2.2,
the following methodology is used:

\- Determine the Xx (smallest power saving gain)-Yy (largest power
saving gain) value based on the smallest and largest values reported by
each company at least considering:

\- Separate observations with corresponding Xx-Yy values are captured at
least for cross-slot and same slot scheduling cases.

\- Separate observations for FR1 & FR2

\- Additional cases for separate observations

\- Capture average/mean value of Xx-Yy excluding the smallest and the
largest values among companies.

\- Explicitly mention the result/observations if it was provided by a
few source companies e.g. 1 or 2 with special setup or assumptions.

\- Highlighting the gain is compared to the UE with configuring the
maximum blind decoding for PDCCH monitoring defined in Rel-15/Rel-16

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For capturing the observations on PDCCH blocking rate in clause 8.2.3,
the following methodology is used:

\- For each of the simultaneously scheduled UE numbers denoting as
\'*N*\' (1\<*N*\<=10)

\- Step 1: Determine a single average/mean value *Average\_a\_N(i)*
based on values reported by each company \'*i*\' with existing Rel-15/16
schemes for DCI transmission

![](./media/image3.emf){width="6.270833333333333in"
height="0.46875in"}for company \'*j*\'. \'*M*\' represents the number of
configurations that are simulated by company \'*j*\' for \'*N*\'
simultaneously scheduled UEs in a slot.

\- Step 2: Determine a single average/mean value *Average\_a\_N* by
averaging the values from different companies for a sperate observation,
excluding the smallest and the largest values of *Average\_a(i)\_N*
among companies if number of source companies \> 3

![](./media/image4.emf){width="5.885416666666667in"
height="0.4479166666666667in"}

where \'*K*\' denotes the number of source companies that simulated a
same observation configuration (e.g. \'*N*=2\' in Table B.1-1) after
excluding the smallest and largest value.

\- Step-3: Reuse the same approach to derive the *Average\_b\_N* for
Case 2 and Case 3 with approximately 25% and 50% BD reduction (see Annex
B).

\- Step-4: Determine the absolute increase and relative increase as
follows:

*- X\_N*% = \[*Average\_b\_N* - *Average\_a\_N*\].

*- Y\_N*% = \[(*Average\_b\_N* - *Average\_a\_N)/ Average\_a\_N* \]

\- Step-5: Capture the PDCCH blocking rate impact based on the following
template:

\- For FR1 with AL distribution configuration A1 in Table 6.2-5 with
\'*N*\' simultaneously scheduled UE in a slot, it was observed that the
PDCCH blocking rate is increased *X\_N*% from \[*Average\_a\_N*\] which
corresponds to *Y\_N*% increase relative to \[*Average\_a\_N\].*

6.3 Evaluation methodology for coverage recovery
------------------------------------------------

Coverage recovery evaluation is based on link budget evaluations.

The channels and messages used in link budget evaluations include PDCCH,
PDSCH, PUCCH, and PUSCH. The initial access related channels, such as
PBCH, PRACH, Msg2, Msg3, Msg4 and PDCCH scheduling Msg2/4 are also
included.

The impact of small form factor is considered for all the uplink and
downlink channels. To reflect such an impact, a 3dB loss of antenna gain
is included in link budget calculation for the FR1 bands.

The assumptions in the Rel-17 Coverage Enhancement SI regarding link
budget template and antenna array gain are reused \[5\]. Furthermore,
the Rel-17 Coverage Enhancement SI assumptions on gNB antenna
configuration, \# gNB Tx and Rx chains, channel model and delay spread
are reused, with the revision or addition shown in Table 6.3-1.

For coverage evaluation, the assumptions for the reference NR UEs and
RedCap UEs are shown in Table 6.3-2 and 6.3-3, respectively.

+-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+

The assumptions for channel specific parameters are also based on
reusing the Rel-17 Coverage Enhancement SI agreements \[5\], with the
revision or addition described below.

The target data rates for RedCap UEs are:

\- FR1 Rural: 1 Mbps on DL and 100kbps in UL

\- FR1 Urban: 2 Mbps on DL and 1Mbps in UL (Note: The 2Mbps target data
rate in downlink is the scaled value of the 10Mbps in the Rel-17
Coverage Enhancement SI by a factor of 0.2)

\- FR2: 25Mbps on DL and 5 Mbps in UL (for bandwidth options 50MHz and
100MHz)

The TBS, PRB, and MCS of PDSCH (except for Msg2) and PUSCH for the
RedCap UE are based on the agreed target data rates or message sizes and
reported by sourcing companies. For Msg2, the assumptions listed in
Table 6.3-4 were adopted.

Table 6.3-4: Assumptions for Msg2

  **Parameters**       **Values**

  PRBs/TBS/MCS         MCS is fixed to zero. Companies to report the used number of PRBs and corresponding TBS value

  DMRS configuration   Type 1, 3 DMRS symbol, no multiplexing with data
  Waveform             CP-OFDM
  HARQ configuration   No retransmission

> Note: the TBS scaling is not precluded in the table entry
> \"PRBs/TBS/MCS\"

For the channel(s) affected by complexity reduction, the following
methodology is used to determine the target performance for coverage
recovery

\- Step 1: Obtain the link budget performance of the channel based on
link budget evaluation

\- Step 2: Obtain the target performance requirement for RedCap UEs
within a deployment scenario

\- Step 3: Find the coverage recovery value for the channel if the link
budget performance is worse than the target performance requirement

For step 2, the study considered two options for determining the target
performance for coverage recovery.

\- Option 1: The target performance requirement for each channel is
identified by a target MPL within a reasonable deployment.

\- Option 3: The target performance requirement for each channel is
identified by the link budget of the bottleneck channel(s) for the
reference NR UE within the same deployment scenario. The \"bottleneck
channel(s)\" are the physical channel(s) that have the lowest MIL.

Eventually, the adopted methodology is based on Option 3 and a single
coverage recovery target based on the same bottleneck channel is used
for initial access channels and non-initial access channels of RedCap
UE. The coverage recovery target for each channel of RedCap UE
corresponds to the link budget of the bottleneck channel(s) for the
reference NR UE within the same deployment scenario, where the reference
UE is a Rel-15/16 NR UE with mandatory features only. Each sourcing
company reports sourcing-company-specific observations of the amount of
compensation for each channel by comparing the link budget with that of
the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE, where the amount of
compensation for each channel is the difference between the link budget
of the channel for RedCap UE and the link budget of the bottleneck
channel for the reference UE. A representative value of the amount of
compensation is derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from the
compensation values from all sourcing companies, including both negative
and non-negative values based on the following adjustments.

\- Excluding the highest & the lowest values when the number of samples
is more than 3.

\- If the number of samples used to compute a representative value is
less than 4 for each scenario, this representative value is not used for
bottleneck identification.

The representative value of a channel is used for identifying whether
the channel needs coverage recovery, and coverage recovery is not needed
if the representative value of a channel is larger than or equal to
zero.

6.4 Evaluation methodology for network capacity and spectral efficiency
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For the evaluations of the impact to network capacity and spectral
efficiency, system-level simulation (SLS) have been used and the
assumptions in TR 38.802, Table A.2.1-1 are used as the baseline.
Additionally, the scenarios and assumptions described in the table below
were agreed for alignment purpose. The same assumptions were adopted by
some sourcing companies for SLS.

simulation

For UE complexity reduction features for evaluation, at least 1Rx and
2Rx are considered for RedCap UEs. In addition, 20MHz, max 64QAM in DL
and max 16QAM in UL are used for FR1, whereas 100MHz, max 16QAM in DL
and max 16QAM in UL are used for FR2. Other UE complexity reduction
feature combinations may also be considered. For the reference eMBB UE,
4Rx for FR1 TDD and 2Rx for FR2 were assumed.

The total system bandwidth in the SLS can be 100 MHz for both FR1 and
FR2 (aligned with the LLS assumption). In FR1, the scheduled bandwidths
for eMBB and RedCap UEs can be up to 100 MHz and 20 MHz, respectively.
In FR2, the scheduled bandwidths for eMBB UEs can be up to 100 MHz, and
up to 100 MHz or 50 MHz for RedCap UEs.

The spectral efficiency (SE) definition for the non-full buffer traffic
is given by:

SE (bps/Hz) = cell average throughput (Mbps) / (cell bandwidth (MHz) \*
RU)

7 UE complexity reduction features
==================================

7.1 Introduction to UE complexity reduction features
----------------------------------------------------

The following UE complexity reduction techniques have been studied:

\- Reduced number of UE Rx branches

\- UE bandwidth reduction

\- Half-duplex FDD operation

\- Relaxed UE processing time

\- Relaxed maximum number of MIMO layers

\- Relaxed maximum modulation order

The evaluation results for each one of the studied individual UE
complexity reduction techniques are captured in clauses 7.2 through 7.7,
respectively. The properties of combinations of different individual UE
complexity reduction techniques are described in clause 7.8.
Recommendations based on the evaluations are captured in clause 13.

The following UE complexity reduction techniques for higher layers have
been discussed in RAN2:

\- Reduction of the maximum number of DRBs which UE needs to mandatorily
support.

\- Reduction of L2 buffer size. According to the calculation in TS
38.306, with peak data rate reductions, L2 buffer requirements for
RedCap UEs are implicitly reduced accordingly. Benefits and feasibility
of further reduction requires evaluation in normative phase if it is to
be considered.

\- SN in PDCP and RLC is 18-bits, and the size could be reduced
depending on which features RedCap UEs support, if a clear benefit in
such reduction is identified.

\- The gain of relaxing RRC processing delay requirements was not
studied and requires further evaluation in normative phase if it is to
be considered.

These UE complexity reduction techniques for higher layers have not been
explicit objectives during the study and would require further
evaluation during the normative phase if they are to be considered.

7.2 Reduced number of UE Rx/Tx antennas
---------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Description of feature

The antenna configurations for RedCap UEs that were considered in the
study are:

\- For FR1: 1Rx/1Tx and 2Rx/1Tx

\- For FR2: 1Rx/1Tx and 2 Rx/1Tx

The evaluation of cost/complexity reduction has been performed with
respect to a reference NR UE. The reference NR UE has the following
antenna configuration:

\- For FR1 FDD: 2Rx/1Tx

\- For FR1 TDD: 4Rx/1Tx

\- For FR2: 2Rx/1Tx

### 7.2.2 Analysis of UE complexity reduction

When the number of UE Rx branches is reduced, the maximum number of DL
MIMO layers is reduced correspondingly. For study purposes, two sets of
evaluation results are presented below. The first set concerns the
estimated cost reduction from reducing the number of Rx branches without
taking the reduced maximum number of downlink MIMO layers into account,
whereas the second set considers both the reduced number of Rx branches
and the corresponding reduction of the maximum number of DL MIMO layers.

The estimated cost for a device with reduced number of UE Rx branches
without taking reduced number of downlink MIMO layers into
consideration, relative to the reference NR device (see evaluation
methodology described in clause 6.1) and averaged over the results
provided by the sourcing companies \[3\], is summarized in Table
7.2.2-1. As can be seen in the last row for the total cost, the average
estimated cost reduction achieved by reducing the number of UE Rx
branches are as follows:

\- FR1 FDD (2Rx 1Rx): \~26%

\- FR1 TDD (4Rx 2Rx): \~31%

\- FR1 TDD (4Rx 1Rx): \~46%

\- FR2 TDD (2Rx 1Rx): \~31%

By comparing Table 7.2.2-1 with the reference NR device cost breakdown
in clause 6.1, it can be observed that the main contributors of the cost
reduction are the following functional blocks:

\- RF: Antenna array (only FR2)

\- RF: Filters

\- RF: Transceiver (including LNAs, mixer, and local oscillator)

\- Baseband: ADC/DAC

\- Baseband: FFT/IFFT

\- Baseband: Post-FFT data buffering

\- Baseband: Receiver processing block

\- Baseband: Synchronization/cell search block

Furthermore, all sourcing companies indicated that the RF cost savings
(but not the baseband cost savings) from reducing the number of UE Rx
branches accumulate across supported bands in both FR1 and FR2.

The reduction of number of UE Rx branches, relative to that of the
reference NR device, may be beneficial in terms of reducing the device
size in FR1. It is unclear whether the reduction of number of UE Rx
branches, relative to that of the reference NR device, may be beneficial
in terms of reducing the device size in FR2. This does not imply that a
non-RedCap NR UE cannot be used in a compact or small form factor in FR1
or FR2.

The estimated cost for a device with reduced number of UE Rx branches
and a corresponding reduction of the number of downlink MIMO layers,
relative to the reference NR device (see evaluation methodology
described in clause 6.1) and averaged over the results provided by the
sourcing companies \[3\], is summarized in Table 7.2.2-2. As can be seen
in the last row for the total cost, the average estimated cost reduction
achieved by reducing the number of UE Rx branches and MIMO layers are as
follows:

\- FR1 FDD (2Rx 1Rx): \~37%

\- FR1 TDD (4Rx 2Rx): \~40%

\- FR1 TDD (4Rx 1Rx): \~60%

\- FR2 TDD (2Rx 1Rx): \~40%

By comparing Table 7.2.2-2 with the reference NR device cost breakdown
in clause 6.1, it can be observed that the main contributors of the cost
reduction are the following functional blocks:

\- RF: Antenna array (only FR2)

\- RF: Filters

\- RF: Transceiver (including LNAs, mixer, and local oscillator)

\- Baseband: ADC/DAC

\- Baseband: FFT/IFFT

\- Baseband: Post-FFT data buffering

\- Baseband: Receiver processing block

\- Baseband: LDPC decoding

\- Baseband: HARQ buffer

\- Baseband: Synchronization/cell search block

\- Baseband: MIMO specific processing blocks

Furthermore, all sourcing companies indicated that the RF cost savings
(but not the baseband cost savings) from reducing the number of UE Rx
branches accumulate across supported bands in both FR1 and FR2, whereas
the cost savings from reducing the number of downlink MIMO layers do
not.

### 7.2.3 Analysis of performance impacts

**Coverage:**

In general, degradation of downlink performance is expected when
reducing the number of Rx branches, which may affect the coverage. The
amount of degradation depends on the number of Rx branches. Quantitative
evaluation results are provided in clause 9.

**Network capacity and spectral efficiency:**

A loss in network capacity and spectral efficiency is expected when
reducing the number of UE Rx branches. The magnitude of the loss depends
on the proportion of RedCap UEs, the traffic characteristics, as well as
on the number of Rx branches. Quantitative evaluation results are
provided in clause 12.

**Data rate:**

Reducing the number of Rx branches at the UE will lower the downlink
peak data rate. This is due to the reduction in number of downlink MIMO
layers that can be supported when the number of Rx branches is reduced.

\- Reduction from 2 Rx branches to 1 Rx branch decreases the downlink
peak rate by \~50%.

\- Reduction from 4 Rx branches to 2 Rx branches decreases the downlink
peak rate by \~50%.

\- Reduction from 4 Rx branches to 1 Rx branch decreases the downlink
peak rate by \~75%.

Despite this reduction in peak data rate, a UE with reduced number of Rx
branches and downlink MIMO layers will be able to sufficiently fulfil
the peak data rate requirements for the RedCap use cases. For peak rate
impacts from other combinations of UE complexity reduction techniques,
see clause 7.8.3.

**Latency and reliability:**

Reducing the number of UE Rx branches has limited impact on the latency
in most cases. However, if the UE is near the cell edge, the latency can
increase. Nevertheless, the latency requirements of RedCap use cases can
be sufficiently fulfilled, in both FR1 and FR2.

The reliability requirements for the RedCap use cases can still be
fulfilled with reduced number of UE Rx branches. However, in some cases,
the reliability can only be maintained at the cost of downlink spectral
efficiency loss.

**Power consumption:**

The instantaneous power consumption in the RF and the baseband modules
of the UE is expected to be reduced due to the use of fewer RF chains
and the reduction in the complexity of multi-antenna processing.
However, downlink reception time may be longer for large payloads due to
reduced spectral efficiency.

**PDCCH blocking rate:**

In order to compensate for the performance degradation resulting from a
reduced number of UE Rx branches, higher aggregation levels may need to
be used. This can lead to increase in PDCCH blocking rate if the amount
of PDCCH resources is not increased.

### 7.2.4 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

In general, RedCap UEs with reduced number of Rx branches can coexist
with legacy UEs. However, the presence of RedCap UEs with reduced number
of Rx branches may impact the performance for legacy UEs if some
broadcast channels are used for both legacy UEs and RedCap UEs. This is
because, if there is no early indication of RedCap UE, both legacy UEs
and RedCap UEs will be treated the same by the network, which may lead
to conservative treatment of all UEs.

If higher PDCCH aggregation levels are used for RedCap UEs, the PDCCH
blocking rate for legacy UEs may be increased if they share the same
CORESET.

### 7.2.5 Analysis of specification impacts

For reduced number of Rx branches, work in RAN4 may be required to
define new receiver characteristics, demodulation performance
requirements, and requirements relating to CSI reporting, RF, RRM, and
other procedures, such as cell handover or (re)selection, radio link
management and beam management. RAN4 may also need to evaluate and
specify new minimum numbers of Rx branches for RedCap UEs in different
bands. Impacts on RAN4 specifications may also extend beyond the
mentioned aspects.

Additionally, to address the performance and coexistence impacts
identified in clauses 7.2.3 and 7.2.4, specification work in other
working groups than RAN4 may be needed.

7.3 UE bandwidth reduction
--------------------------

### 7.3.1 Description of feature

In the study, the main UE bandwidth reduction options considered are:

\- For FR1: 20 MHz

\- For FR2: 50 MHz or 100 MHz

The study uses a legacy NR UE as a reference. The evaluation of
cost/complexity reduction is with respect to a reference UE with maximum
bandwidth capability shown below.

\- For FR1: 100 MHz for DL and UL

\- For FR2: 200 MHz for DL and UL

For the baseline UE bandwidth capability of RedCap UEs, the same maximum
UE bandwidth in a band applies to both RF and baseband. It is also
primarily assumed that this maximum UE bandwidth applies to both data
and control channels and that this maximum UE bandwidth is assumed for
both DL and UL. A few contributions analysed other mixes of bandwidths.

### 7.3.2 Analysis of UE complexity reduction

The estimated cost for a device with reduced maximum UE bandwidth,
relative to the reference NR device (see evaluation methodology
described in clause 6.1) and averaged over the results provided by the
sourcing companies \[3\], is summarized in Table 7.3.2-1. As can be seen
in the last row for the total cost, the average estimated cost reduction
achieved by reducing the UE bandwidth from 100 MHz to 20 MHz is \~32%
for FR1 FDD and \~33% for FR1 TDD. For FR2, the average estimated cost
reduction achieved by reducing the UE bandwidth from 200 MHz to 100 MHz
and 50 MHz is \~16% and \~23%, respectively.

By comparing Table 7.3.2-1 with the reference NR device cost breakdown
in clause 6.1, it can be observed that the main contributors of the cost
reduction are the following functional blocks:

\- Baseband: ADC/DAC

\- Baseband: FFT/IFFT

\- Baseband: Post-FFT data buffering

\- Baseband: Receiver processing block

\- Baseband: LDPC decoding

\- Baseband: HARQ buffer

Although the results from most sourcing companies do not show PA cost
reduction from bandwidth reduction, some sourcing companies indicate
that PA cost can be reduced due to Tx bandwidth reduction from 100 MHz
to 20 MHz in FR1.

Furthermore, \~75% of sourcing companies indicated that the cost savings
do not accumulate across supported bands.

bandwidth

### 7.3.3 Analysis of performance impacts

**Coverage:**

The impact of reduced bandwidth on the coverage of downlink and uplink
channels would not be large, although a small loss may be observed due
to reduced frequency diversity.

For PDCCH coverage, one important aspect is whether the larger
aggregation levels (AL), e.g. 8 and 16, can be supported after bandwidth
reduction. In FR1, UE bandwidth 20 MHz is enough for supporting AL 16
for any CORESET\#0 configuration. In FR2, UE bandwidth 100 MHz is also
enough for supporting AL 16 for any CORESET\#0 configuration. However,
reducing the UE bandwidth to 50 MHz in FR2 will have impact on PDCCH
coverage when CORESET\#0 is configured to have 69.12 MHz bandwidth. The
loss is assessed to be \~1.5-3.0 dB. Reducing the UE bandwidth to 50 MHz
will have impact on PBCH coverage if the SSB is configured with 240 kHz
SCS. The loss is assessed to be within 1 dB. Furthermore, reducing the
UE bandwidth to 50 MHz may also impact the coverage of initial access
messages if CORESET\#0 is configured to have 69.12 MHz bandwidth.

**Network capacity and spectral efficiency:**

Bandwidth reduction in FR1 will not have a significant impact on
capacity and spectral efficiency, although there may be some minor
degradation due to the loss in frequency selective scheduling gain.

Bandwidth reduction in FR2 may be associated with more noticeable loss
in capacity and spectral efficiency if analog beamforming is being used.
In this case, the loss will be larger for 50 MHz UE bandwidth than for
100 MHz UE bandwidth.

**Data rate:**

Bandwidth reduction results in a reduction in the achievable peak data
rate. However, all the bandwidth options (20 MHz in FR1, and 50 MHz or
100 MHz in FR2) considered in the RedCap study are enough for meeting
the peak data rate requirements for the RedCap use cases, at least when
the bandwidth reduction is not combined with other UE complexity
reduction techniques, except in some TDD configurations. For peak rate
impacts from combinations of UE complexity reduction techniques, see
clause 7.8.3.

**Latency and reliability:**

All the latency and reliability requirements for the RedCap use cases
can be satisfied by all the bandwidth options (20 MHz in FR1, and 50 MHz
or 100 MHz in FR2)

In FR2, UE bandwidth reduction may result in a longer SSB/SIB1
acquisition time for certain configurations for SSB/CORESET multiplexing
patterns 2 and 3. To minimize the SSB/SIB1 acquisition time, it may be
beneficial to support an FR2 RedCap UE bandwidth of 100 MHz.

**PDCCH blocking rate:**

If CORESET is configured according to the RedCap UE capability and
shared by both RedCap and non-RedCap UEs, this may result in increased
PDCCH blocking rate. In that case, the impact of an FR2 RedCap UE
bandwidth of 50 MHz would be greater than for 100 MHz.

### 7.3.4 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

In general, UE bandwidth options such as 20 MHz for FR1 UEs and 100 MHz
for FR2 UEs achieve good coexistence performance with legacy UEs.

\- The 20 MHz bandwidth option for FR1 UEs allows a RedCap UE to reuse
existing procedures for acquiring SSB, SIB1, other SIBs, RAR and Msg4.

\- The 100 MHz bandwidth option for FR2 UEs achieves the same
coexistence benefits, except that for certain configurations for
SSB/CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, the UE needs to acquire SSB
and SIB1 in a sequential manner. However, the sequential SSB/SIB1
acquisition for a RedCap UE does not cause any performance degradation
to legacy UEs.

\- The 50 MHz bandwidth option for FR2 UEs would result in coverage loss
for PDCCH reception in CORESET\#0 if CORESET\#0 is configured to 69.12
MHz. In such cases, if coverage recovery is needed for PDCCH, PDCCH
capacity of CORESET\#0 may be affected, and this will have impact on
legacy UEs. Furthermore, if early RedCap UE identification is not
provided, supporting 50-MHz RedCap UEs requires the gNB to schedule the
PDSCH of SIBs, RAR, and Msg4 within 50 MHz bandwidth. Such scheduling
restrictions will have an impact on legacy UEs.

If RedCap and eMBB UEs share the same initial BWP in downlink and uplink
for initial access procedure, and the number of RedCap UEs in the
network is large, gNB may need to use some means (e.g. access control)
to avoid congestion due to high load or configuration restriction (e.g.
for RACH occasions).

### 7.3.5 Analysis of specification impacts

At least the UE bandwidth reduction options 20 MHz in FR1 and 100 MHz in
FR2 are expected to have small specification impacts. With proper
configurations of RRC parameters and support of early indication of
RedCap UE, the network may be able to support RedCap UE bandwidth
reduction with minor or no additional specification changes.

However, to address the performance and coexistence impacts identified
in clauses 7.3.3 and 7.3.4, specification work would be needed.

7.4 Half-duplex FDD operation
-----------------------------

### 7.4.1 Description of feature

Half-duplex operation allows the UE to receive and transmit on different
frequencies, but not at the same time. Half-duplex mode allows for
removing a duplexer and instead use a switch and an additional filter.

The RedCap study includes both HD-FDD operation Type A and Type B, as
defined in LTE, where study of Type A is prioritized.

### 7.4.2 Analysis of UE complexity reduction

The estimated cost for an HD-FDD only device, relative to the reference
NR device (see evaluation methodology described in clause 6.1) and
averaged over the results provided by the sourcing companies \[3\], is
summarized in Table 7.4.2-1.

\- For Type A HD-FDD, a high proportion of the cost saving occurs
because the duplexer can be replaced with a switch and a lowpass filter.

\- For Type B HD-FDD, uplink and downlink can share one local
oscillator, therefore, some additional saving on RF transceiver can be
obtained.

By comparing Table 7.4.2-1 with the reference NR device cost breakdown
in clause 6.1, it can be observed that the main contributor of the cost
reduction is the duplexer/switch block. Depending on the implementation,
as indicated by some sourcing companies, removing the duplexer may also
reduce the insertion loss in both the Rx and Tx chains and as a result,
the PA power can be reduced, and the LNA sensitivity requirement can be
relaxed which allows for potential UE complexity reduction.

As can be seen in the last row for the total cost, the average estimated
cost reduction achieved by Type A and Type B HD-FDD is approximately
\~7% and \~10%, respectively.

Furthermore, all sourcing companies indicated that the RF cost savings
(but not the baseband cost savings) accumulate across supported bands.

It is unclear whether the HD-FDD operation may be beneficial in terms of
reducing the device size in FR1 FDD.

### 7.4.3 Analysis of performance impacts

**Coverage:**

If there are no stringent requirements on latency and data rate, then
HD-FDD will not result in coverage loss, otherwise a coverage loss can
be expected.

**Network capacity and spectral efficiency:**

HD-FDD operation has minor impact on spectral efficiency and capacity.

**Data rate:**

There is minor impact from HD-FDD operation on instantaneous data rates
for uplink or downlink, but similarly to TDD, HD-FDD reduces user
throughput compared to FD-FDD, especially in case of simultaneous
downlink and uplink traffic, and it may be challenging to meet the peak
data rate requirements in downlink and uplink simultaneously. For peak
rate impacts from other combinations of UE complexity reduction
techniques, see clause 7.8.3.

**Latency and reliability:**

HD-FDD introduces longer latency than FD-HDD, especially in case of
simultaneous downlink and uplink traffic, but the latency and
reliability requirements of RedCap use cases can still be fulfilled at
least for one direction (downlink or uplink).

**Power consumption:**

The lower insertion loss of an HD-FDD UE may enable a higher power
efficiency in the transmit chain and reduce power consumption.
Furthermore, compared to the reference NR modem, half-duplex operation
means some components can work in a reduced power state until required.
However, on the other hand, HD-FDD may have a negative impact on UE
average power consumption because the UE will be active for a longer
time before being able to return to a lower power light sleep or deep
sleep state. The impact on power consumption of HD-FDD depends on
implementation and traffic characteristics.

**PDCCH blocking rate:**

HD-FDD operation may potentially reduce the available PDCCH monitoring
occasions when the UE is transmitting rather than receiving.

### 7.4.4 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

Introducing HD-FDD operation might make gNB scheduling more complicated.
The impact due to the support for HD-FDD Type B operation is greater
than for Type A.

For initial access, supporting HD-FDD Type B operation might have a
potential impact on the RACH procedure in that longer time gaps between
messages might be needed. One example is the switching time from PRACH
to Msg2. Supporting HD-FDD Type B operation may cause a longer switching
time from PRACH to Msg2 to be used for all UEs, if the RedCap UEs are
not identified in Msg1. This is not an issue for Type A due to its
faster UL-to-DL switching capability.

### 7.4.5 Analysis of specification impacts

Introducing support for HD-FDD operation may have the following impacts
on RAN1 specifications.

\- Specifying DL-to-UL and UL-to-DL switching time

\- Specifying how the UE handles DL/UL collision

Depending on the detailed solution, it may or may not be possible to
reuse existing RAN1 specification for non-full-duplex operation for
support of HD-FDD operation type A (but not for type B).

Additionally, HD-FDD support also has the following impacts on RAN4
specifications.

\- Specifying applicable bands

\- Specifying performance requirements such as reference sensitivity and
RRM

7.5 Relaxed UE processing time
------------------------------

### 7.5.1 Description of feature

In the RedCap study item, relaxed UE processing time is considered in
terms of more relaxed N~1~ and N~2~ values (as defined in TS 38.214)
compared to those of UE processing time capability 1. In the study, for
the purpose of evaluation, the relaxed UE processing time in terms of
N~1~ and N~2~ are assumed to be doubled compared to those of capability
1, i.e.,

\- N~1~ = 16, 20, 34, and 40 symbols for 15, 30, 60, and 120 kHz SCS
(assuming only front-loaded DMRS)

\- N~2~ = 20, 24, 46, and 72 symbols for 15, 30, 60, and 120 kHz SCS

In the study, for the purpose of evaluation, relaxed CSI computation
time was also considered, assuming doubled Z and Z\' compared to the
values defined in TS 38.214 clause 5.4.

### 7.5.2 Analysis of UE complexity reduction

**Relaxed UE processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~:**

The estimated cost for a device with relaxed UE processing time in terms
of N~1~ and N~2~ (see evaluation methodology described in clause 6.1)
and averaged over the results provided by the sourcing companies \[3\],
is summarized in Table 7.5.2-1. As can be seen in the last row for the
total cost, the average estimated cost reduction is \~6% for FR1 FDD,
\~6% for FR1 TDD, and \~6% for FR2 TDD.

Relaxed UE processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ potentially reduces
UE complexity by allowing a longer time for the processing of PDCCH and
PDSCH and preparing PUSCH and PUCCH. By comparing Table 7.5.2-1 with the
reference NR device cost breakdown in clause 6.1, it can be observed
that the cost of the following functional blocks can be reduced:

\- Baseband: Receiver processing block

\- Baseband: LDPC decoding

\- Baseband: DL control processing & decoder

\- Baseband: UL processing block

Whether the relaxed UE processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ may
reduce the cost/complexity in the \'DL control processing & decoder\'
block depends on the UE implementation.

Furthermore, all sourcing companies indicated that these cost savings do
not accumulate across supported bands.

time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~

**Relaxed UE processing time in terms of CSI computation time:**

One source provided estimates of the cost for a device with relaxed UE
processing time in terms of CSI computation time (see evaluation
methodology described in clause 6.1) as summarized in Table 7.5.2-2. As
can be seen in the last row for the total cost, the estimated cost
reduction is \~5% for FR1 FDD, \~4.5% for FR1 TDD, and \~6% for FR2 TDD.
The cost reduction gain is estimated without combination with relaxation
in terms of N~1~ and N~2~.

### 7.5.3 Analysis of performance impacts

**Coverage:**

No coverage impact is expected from a more relaxed UE processing time in
terms of N~1~ and N~2~.

**Network capacity and spectral efficiency:**

Depending on the gNB scheduler implementation, there may be no or minor
impact on network capacity or spectral efficiency from a more relaxed UE
processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~.

**Data rate:**

No impact on instantaneous peak data rate is expected from a more
relaxed UE processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~, but the UE
throughput may be reduced if the HARQ round trip time is extended. The
throughput requirements identified for the RedCap use cases are still
expected to be fulfilled.

**Latency and reliability:**

Relaxed UE processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ has impact on
latency. For downlink transmission, relaxed N~1~ value impacts how fast
HARQ-ACK feedback can be sent after the reception of PDSCH. For uplink
transmission, relaxed N2 value impacts how fast PUSCH can be scheduled
with respect to the UL grant. How significant the impact on latency is
depends on use cases and scheduled number of retransmissions.

**Power consumption:**

Relaxed UE processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ may allow for
processing with lower clock frequency and lower voltage which may help
reducing the UE power consumption. The impact on power consumption of
relaxed UE processing time depends on implementation and traffic
characteristics.

### 7.5.4 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

In scenarios where RedCap UEs coexist with legacy UEs, relaxed UE
processing time capability in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ may for RedCap UEs
increase the complexity for the scheduling.

The relaxed UE processing time capability in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ may
cause potential coexistence issues with legacy UEs during initial access
if early identification of RedCap UEs prior to Msg2 scheduling is not
supported or conservative scheduling is not possible. If gNB schedules
all UEs according to relaxed timing relationships for RedCap UEs, legacy
UEs may experience an increase in control plane latency.

### 7.5.5 Analysis of specification impacts

A new UE processing time capability needs to be defined if relaxed UE
processing time in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ is introduced. New values of
N~1~ and N~2~, as well as how the PDSCH processing time and PUSCH
preparation time are determined by N~1~ and N~2~, need to be defined.

Depending on the degree of relaxation of the N~1~ and N~2~ values,
specification details on scheduling timing related to the default TDRA
tables and HARQ-ACK timing range may also need to be updated.

7.6 Relaxed maximum number of MIMO layers
-----------------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Description of feature

In the study, the following relaxation options for maximum number of DL
MIMO layers were studied and evaluated:

\- For FR1 FDD: 1 MIMO layer

\- For FR1 TDD: 1 and 2 MIMO layers

\- For FR2: 1 MIMO layer

The study uses a legacy NR UE as a reference. The evaluation of
cost/complexity reduction is with respect to a reference UE with the
maximum number of DL MIMO layers support shown below.

\- For FR1 FDD: 2 MIMO layers

\- For FR1 TDD: 4 MIMO layers

\- For FR2: 2 MIMO layers

It is primarily assumed that this maximum number of MIMO layers applies
to DL data channel only.

### 7.6.2 Analysis of UE complexity reduction

The estimated cost for a device with relaxed maximum number of MIMO
layers (see evaluation methodology described in clause 6.1) and averaged
over the results provided by the sourcing companies \[3\], is summarized
in Table 7.6.2-1. As can be seen in the last row for the total cost, the
average estimated cost reduction achieved by relaxing the maximum number
of MIMO layers from 2 to 1 layer is \~12% for FR1 FDD, from 4 to 2 layer
is \~11% for FR1 TDD, from 4 to 1 layer is \~17% for FR1 TDD, and from 2
to 1 layer is \~11% for FR2.

By comparing Table 7.6.2-1 with the reference NR device cost breakdown
in clause 6.1, it can be observed that the main contributors of the cost
reduction are the following functional blocks:

\- Baseband: Receiver processing block

\- Baseband: LDPC decoding

\- Baseband: HARQ buffer

\- Baseband: MIMO specific processing block

Furthermore, all sourcing companies indicated that these cost savings do
not accumulate across supported bands. Finally, it can be noted that for
an FR1 UE supporting multiple bands, the baseband cost/complexity
reduction may be limited by the case with the highest maximum number of
MIMO layers among the supported bands.

### 7.6.3 Analysis of performance impacts

**Coverage:**

Reducing the maximum number of MIMO layers does not impact the coverage.

**Network capacity and spectral efficiency:**

Since reducing the maximum number of MIMO layers reduces the peak data
rate, it degrades the network capacity and spectral efficiency.
Especially, the reduction of maximum number of MIMO layers mainly
**degrades** the spectral efficiency for UEs in good channel
conditions**.**

**Data rate:**

Reducing the maximum number of downlink MIMO layers will lower the
downlink peak data rate.

\- Reduction from 2 layers to 1 layer decreases the downlink peak rate
by \~50%.

\- Reduction from 4 layers to 2 layers decreases the downlink peak rate
by \~50%.

\- Reduction from 4 layers to 1 layer decreases the downlink peak rate
by \~75%.

Despite this reduction in peak data rate, the UE with reduced number of
downlink MIMO layers will be able to sufficiently fulfil the peak data
rate requirements for the RedCap uses cases. For peak rate impacts from
combinations of UE complexity reduction techniques, see clause 7.8.3.

**Latency and reliability:**

Reducing the number of MIMO layers does not impact the latency and
reliability significantly. The reduction of the maximum number of MIMO
layers is only expected to affect the achievable latency for UEs in good
channel conditions. The latency requirements of most RedCap use cases
can still be sufficiently fulfilled.

### 7.6.4 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

There is no significant coexistence impact from reduction of the maximum
number of MIMO layers for RedCap UEs.

### 7.6.5 Analysis of specification impacts

The specification impact from reduction of the maximum number of MIMO
layers for RedCap UEs is small.

7.7 Relaxed maximum modulation order
------------------------------------

### 7.7.1 Description of feature

Relaxation of maximum mandatory modulation orders reduces complexity
through reducing the amount of RF and baseband processing required.

In the study, the main options for relaxation of maximum mandatory
modulation orders considered are:

\- UL:

\- FR1: 16QAM instead of 64QAM

\- FR2: 16QAM instead of 64QAM

\- DL

\- FR1: 64QAM instead of 256QAM

\- FR2: 16QAM instead of 64QAM

The study uses a legacy NR UE as a reference. The evaluation of
cost/complexity reduction is with respect to a reference UE with the
maximum modulation orders shown below.

\- UL:

\- FR1: 64QAM

\- FR2: 64QAM

\- DL

\- FR1: 256QAM

\- FR2: 64QAM

**It is primarily assumed that these maximum modulation orders apply to
data channels only.**

### 7.7.2 Analysis of UE complexity reduction

The estimated cost for a device with relaxed maximum modulation order
(see evaluation methodology described in clause 6.1) and averaged over
the results provided by the sourcing companies \[3\], is summarized in
Table 7.7.2-1 and Table 7.7.2-2.

**Relaxed maximum uplink modulation order:**

As can be seen in the last row for the total cost in Table 7.7.2-1, the
average estimated cost reduction achieved by relaxing the maximum uplink
modulation order from 64QAM to 16QAM is \~2% for FR1 FDD, FR1 TDD, and
FR2.

By comparing Table 7.7.2-1 with the reference NR device cost breakdown
in clause 6.1, it can be observed that the main contributors of the cost
reduction are the following functional blocks:

\- RF: Power amplifier

\- RF: Transceiver

\- Baseband: ADC/DAC

\- Baseband: UL processing block

Furthermore, \~50% of sourcing companies indicated that the RF cost
savings (but not the baseband cost savings) accumulate across supported
bands.

modulation order

**Relaxed maximum downlink modulation order:**

From Table 7.7.2-2, the average estimated cost reduction achieved by
relaxing the maximum downlink modulation order from 256QAM to 64QAM is
\~6% for both FR1 FDD and TDD bands. For FR2, the average estimated cost
reduction achieved by relaxing the maximum DL modulation order from
64QAM to 16QAM is \~6%.

By comparing Table 7.7.2-2 with the reference NR device cost breakdown
in clause 6.1, it can be observed that the main contributors of the cost
reduction are the following functional blocks:

\- RF: Transceiver

\- Baseband: ADC/DAC

\- Baseband: Receiver processing block

\- Baseband: LDPC decoding

\- Baseband: HARQ buffer

Furthermore, more than 70% of sourcing companies indicated that these
cost savings do not accumulate across supported bands.

### 7.7.3 Analysis of performance impacts

**Coverage:**

Relaxation of maximum mandatory modulation orders does not impact the
coverage.

**Network capacity and spectral efficiency:**

Relaxation of maximum mandatory modulation orders will reduce spectral
efficiency due to reduced peak data rate. Quantitative evaluation
results are provided in clause 12.

**Data rate:**

Reducing the maximum modulation orders will lower the downlink peak data
rate.

\- Reduction from 256QAM to 64QAM decreases the downlink peak rate by
\~25%.

\- Reduction from 64QAM to 16QAM decreases the downlink peak rate by
\~33%.

Despite this reduction in peak data rate, the UE will be able to
sufficiently fulfil the peak data rate requirements for the RedCap uses
cases. For peak rate impacts from combinations of UE complexity
reduction techniques, see clause 7.8.3.

**Latency and reliability:**

Relaxing the maximum modulation orders may increase the latency
slightly. Nevertheless, all the latency and reliability requirements for
the RedCap use cases can be satisfied by all the studied options for
relaxed maximum modulation orders.

**Power consumption:**

Relaxation of maximum modulation orders can reduce power consumption of
the RF and baseband modules marginally during transmission and
reception.

### 7.7.4 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

Relaxing the maximum modulation orders for RedCap UEs will have no
significant impacts on coexistence with legacy UEs.

### 7.7.5 Analysis of specification impacts

The specification impact from relaxed maximum modulation orders for
RedCap UEs is small, assuming that no performance optimizations are
introduced.

7.8 Combinations of UE complexity reduction features
----------------------------------------------------

### 7.8.1 Description of feature combinations

The evaluation results for the studied individual UE complexity
reduction techniques are captured in clauses 7.2 through 7.7. In this
clause, the properties of combinations of different individual UE
complexity reduction techniques are described.

### 7.8.2 Analysis of UE complexity reduction

The estimated costs and estimated cost reductions for devices employing
one or more of the UE complexity reduction techniques (see descriptions
in clauses 7.2 through 7.7), relative to the reference NR device (see
evaluation methodology described in clause 6.1) and averaged over the
results provided by the sourcing companies \[3\], are summarized in
Table 7.8.2-1 for FR1 FDD, Table 7.8.2-2 for FR1 TDD, and Table 7.8.2-3
for FR2.

8 UE power saving features
==========================

8.1 Introduction to UE power saving features
--------------------------------------------

The following UE power saving techniques have been studied:

\- Reduced PDCCH monitoring by smaller numbers of blind decodes and CCE
limits

\- Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle

\- RRM relaxation for stationary devices

The outcomes of the studies of these techniques are captured in clauses
8.2 through 8.4, respectively, and summarized in clause 13.

In addition, RAN2 has studied the impact of introducing RedCap UEs on UE
power consumption in general and has observed that power consumption of
RedCap UEs may be impacted because of paging false alarm and unnecessary
SIB1 reading. Paging false alarm and unnecessary SIB1 reading are not
specific to RedCap UEs and are discussed in Rel-17 Power Saving WI.
Enhancements introduced by Rel-17 Power Saving WI should also be
applicable to RedCap UEs.

8.2 Reduced PDCCH monitoring
----------------------------

### 8.2.1 Description of feature

**Scheme \#1: Reduced maximum number of Blind Decoding (BD) per slot in
connected mode:**

In Rel-15 and Rel-16 NR, the number of BDs per slot is configurable up
to the limits defined for different SCS configurations, as summarized in
8.2.1-1. Scheme \#1 reduces the maximum number of BDs in a slot. In
Rel-15 and Rel-16 specifications, the total number of different DCI
sizes configured to monitor is up to 4 with up to 3 different DCI sizes
with C-RNTI. Two alternatives were studied under Scheme \#1, which
includes reduced maximum number of BDs per slot with additionally
reduced DCI size budget (Alt.1a) and reduced maximum number of BDs per
slot without reduced DCI size budget (Alt.1b).

Table 8.2.1-1: Blind decoding limits in NR.

  **SCS \[kHz\]**                  **15**   **30**   **60**   **120**
  -------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- ---------
  **Max \# BD per slot (in NR)**   44       36       22       20

**Scheme \#2: Extending the PDCCH monitoring gap to X slots (X\>1) in
connected mode:**

 In Rel-15/16 NR, the range of PDCCH monitoring periodicity is
configurable, which is in a range of a few symbol (s) to 2560 slots
subject to UE capability. Scheme\#2 is to extend the minimum separation
between two consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions, spans or slots with
configured PDCCH candidates to be X slots, where X\>1. 

**Scheme \#3: Dynamic adaptation of PDCCH BD parameters in connected
mode:**

In Rel-15/16, the parameters of PDCCH monitoring is configured by RRC
signalling on a per search space set basis. Scheme \#3 is to dynamically
adapt PDCCH BD parameters e.g. maximum number of PDCCH candidates per
PDCCH monitoring occasion and minimum time separation between two
consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions

### 8.2.3 Analysis of performance impacts

**PDCCH blocking rate vector format:**

Each observation below for PDCCH blocking rate impact based on the
evaluation results in \[3\] is formulated using the vector format: *\<N,
A%, \[z1%, x1%, y1%\], \[z2%, x2%, y2%\]\>*, which represents the
following: With *N* simultaneously scheduled UEs in a slot and
*z1%* reduction in maximum PDCCH blind decoding, the PDCCH blocking rate
is increased approximately *x1%* from *A%*, which corresponds to
*y1%* increase relative to *A%.* With *N* simultaneously scheduled UEs
in a slot and *z2%* reduction in maximum PDCCH blind decoding, the PDCCH
blocking rate is increased approximately *x2%* from *A%*, which
corresponds to *y2%* increase relative to *A%*.

**Latency and scheduling flexibility:**

The latency impact due to BD reduction may largely depend on PDCCH
blocking rate performance impact. If the PDCCH blocking rate is
increased by BD reduction, the average latency is expected to be
increased; Otherwise, BD reduction has no impact on the latency.  

Scheduling flexibility may or may not be impacted by BD reduction
depending on multiple factors at least including BW, Subcarrier Spacing
(SCS), CORESET size, AL distribution, channel condition, number of ALs
per UE, number of UEs that need to be simultaneously scheduled, DCI size
budget reduction, etc.

### 8.2.4 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

The potential impacts on legacy UEs, in terms of PDCCH blocking rate,
when coexisting with RedCap UEs in a shared CORESET depend on the
scheduling strategy and system parameters. Depending on the network
implementation, if legacy UEs are prioritized over RedCap UEs, there is
no coexistence impact on the legacy UEs at the cost of increased latency
at the RedCap UE side.

### 8.2.5 Analysis of specification impacts

For reduced PDCCH monitoring, the following specification impacts are
foreseen:

\- Depending on the considered techniques, for scheme with reducing
maximum number of PDCCH candidates, specification impact may include
reducing the limit on maximum number of PDCCH candidates.

\- For extending the PDCCH monitoring gap to X slots (X\>1), the minimum
separation between two consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions, spans or
slots configured with PDCCH candidates is increased from 1 slot to X\>1
slots and X needs to be specified.

\- For dynamic adaptation of PDCCH BD parameters in connected mode,
specification impacts may include mechanisms used to dynamically adapt
PDCCH BD parameters e.g., maximum number of BDs per PDCCH monitoring
occasion, span or slot and minimum time separation between two
consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions, spans or slots configured with
PDCCH candidates.

\- The existing Rel-15/Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring configuration can still
be used to configure the BD candidates and PDCCH monitoring gap.
Additional specification impacts may include one or more of following:
reducing DCI size budget, modification to DCI size alignment rule, DCI
format design (including single PDSCH scheduling and multiple PDSCHs
scheduling), modification to PDCCH candidates dropping rule, to minimize
the PDCCH blocking rate impact and network restriction.

8.3 Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle
---------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Description of feature

In LTE connected to EPC, the UE may be configured with an extended DRX
(eDRX) cycle. The UE may operate in eDRX only if the UE is configured by
NAS and the cell indicates support for eDRX in System Information (note
that there is no System Information indication for NB-IoT). In
RRC\_IDLE, the eDRX cycle has the maximum value of 2621.44 seconds
(43.69 minutes). For NB-IoT the maximum value of eDRX cycle is 10485.76
seconds (2.91 hours). Hyper SFN (H-SFN) is broadcasted in System
Information and incremented by one when SFN wraps around. The Paging
Hyperframe (PH) refers to the H-SFN in which the UE starts to monitor
for paging during a Paging Time Window (PTW), see e.g. \[12\].

RAN2 has studied the following topics related to extended DRX for
RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE:

\- Analysis of UE power saving

\- Analysis of upper and lower bound of extended DRX cycles

\- Analysis of mechanisms for extended DRX

### 8.3.2 Analysis of UE power saving

Annex E.1 lists power saving results and analysis from two sources for
extended DRX in RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE.

In summary, one source finds that an eDRX cycle of 10485.76 seconds
(2.91 hours) can result in power saving between 34-80 % for a high SINR
case and between 56-91 % for a low SINR using an RRC\_IDLE DRX cycle
(with equal PTW length) from 2.56 seconds down to 320 ms. One source
provides a plot of possible UE battery lifetime against eDRX cycle
length. The battery lifetime for a UE with a 2-minute eDRX cycle
compared to the same device with 10.24 seconds eDRX cycle is shown to
result in between 0.38 -- 340 % improvements for RRC\_IDLE and 1-419 %
improvements for RRC\_INACTIVE, respectively. The evaluation has been
performed for various use cases and inter-arrival times from 100 ms up
to 5 minutes.

From RAN2 perspective, extended DRX is beneficial for UE power
consumption and can be specified and configured for RedCap UEs so that
eDRX cycles can be used in RRC\_IDLE and in RRC\_INACTIVE states.

RAN2 sees a benefit extending the eDRX cycle in RRC\_INACTIVE beyond
10.24 seconds for RedCap UEs for the following reasons:

\- It is very beneficial to have eDRX cycles \>10.24 seconds in
RRC\_INACTIVE to effectively support the use of Rel-17 SDT (small data
transmission) e.g. for use cases with periodic uplink data with
periodicity \> 10.24 seconds. TS 22.104 provides such use cases, e.g.
some industrial wireless sensors need to transfer small packets and have
strict battery lifetime requirements, while not being sensitive to DL
traffic delay.

\- Based on the results in Annex E.1, there is a clear power saving gain
vs eDRX in RRC\_IDLE at least for eDRX cycles in the range from 10.24
seconds up to couple of minutes, where the UE in eDRX in RRC\_INACTIVE
additionally benefits from less signaling. Based on these results,
lifetime of several years would not be achievable in some cases (e.g.
1-minute inter-arrival time) if only RRC\_IDLE can be used, because of
the signaling overhead.

\- Signaling reduction is an additional benefit from network point of
view -- there is need for less RRC signaling.

The potential issues with eDRX extension beyond 10.24 seconds for
RRC\_INACTIVE are:

\- Impact on CN procedures (e.g. NAS retransmission), thus SA2/CT1 must
be consulted on the feasibility.

\- Potential handling of different eDRX cycles \> 10.24 seconds and/or
PTWs, one for IDLE and the other for INACTIVE.

\- It needs to be studied which node decides and configures the eDRX
cycle for RRC\_INACTIVE.

SA2/CT1 must be consulted on the feasibility prior to the introduction
of eDRX cycles longer than 10.24 seconds in RRC\_INACTIVE.

### 8.3.3 Analysis of upper and lower bound of extended DRX cycles

For the upper bound, the eDRX cycle should support up to 10485.76
seconds, since the upper limit of the H-SFN (10 bits) already is
10485.76 seconds, and 5GC already supports eDRX values up to 10485.76
seconds for NB-IoT and LTE-MTC connected to 5GC. Although little power
saving gain has been observed beyond 2621.44 seconds (simulation results
show that the gain is saturated at around 40 minutes, see Annex E),
there is no reason to artificially limit the range without technical
concern, e.g., unless RAN4 indicates such eDRX value requires UE to
perform RRM on serving cell outside PTW.

Shorter values than 5.12 seconds for the DRX cycles, such as 2.56
seconds, have also been studied. For the lower bound of the eDRX cycle,
one motivation to support down to 2.56 seconds is that at least some
RedCap UEs should be able to support the reception of emergency
broadcast services (e.g. ETWS primary notification) within the required
delay budget of 4 seconds while still saving power. This is not possible
with 5.12 seconds eDRX cycle lengths. However, other solutions exist
allowing RedCap UEs to receive emergency broadcast services without
requiring eDRX to support lower cycle values than legacy LTE (5.12
seconds), while also saving power:

\- **Solution 1**: For RedCap UEs, if the NAS configures the UE with a
2.56 seconds DRX UE-specific paging cycle, the RedCap UE follows this
DRX cycle even when the RAN paging cycle or default paging cycle is
shorter.

\- **Solution 2**: gNB can configure 2.56 seconds default broadcasted
DRX cycle for those RedCap UEs that need to receive emergency broadcast
services and a shorter UE-specific RAN paging cycle can be configured
for UEs with tighter latency requirements (e.g. smartphones).

Solution 1 is similar to supporting eDRX cycle of 2.56 seconds in that
the UE does not need to follow shorter RAN or default paging cycle, and
therefore has the same pros/cons: it enables a mix of smartphones and
RedCap UEs in the network, with an appropriate paging cycle configured
for each of them. However, these solutions (solution 1 and eDRX with
2.56 seconds cycle) assume such RedCap UEs do not need to monitor gNB
configured default broadcasted paging (and UE-specific RAN paging)
cycles, thus resulting in network not being able to reach such RedCap
UEs by using default broadcasted paging cycles and/or UE-specific RAN
paging cycles. This may result e.g. in a potential risk of UE missing SI
change indicator. Specifically, solution 1 requires a different way to
determine the UE DRX cycle for RedCap UEs in both the UE and the gNB.

Solution 2 is consistent with the LTE solution, but a default
broadcasted DRX value of 2.56 seconds is expected not to be widely used,
e.g. in existing deployments supporting smartphones, requiring changes
to the paging cycle in existing deployments and configuration of a
UE-specific paging cycle for each UE intended to follow a shorter paging
cycle.

Other solutions also exist that do not consider the power saving aspects
for UEs receiving emergency broadcast services. For example, a simple
solution is that RedCap UEs that need to receive emergency broadcast
services do not request to be configured with eDRX, and no specific
handling/configuration is required for those UEs. However, such RedCap
UEs do not benefit from any specific eDRX power saving. Alternately, a
RedCap UE could request an eDRX configuration while still monitoring for
ETWS and CMAS in between the paging occasions.

### 8.3.4 Analysis of mechanisms for extended DRX

If extension of the eDRX cycles beyond 10.24 seconds is specified, a
feasible extension mechanism is expected to be similar to what is
specified for LTE. This mechanism would include the use of H-SFN, PH and
PTW, see e.g. \[12\].

For RedCap UEs in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE, if the eDRX cycle is less
than or equal to 10.24 seconds, the paging monitoring configuration does
not use PTW and PH.

Specifically, for the case when the eDRX cycle equals 10.24 seconds, the
pros and cons of not using PTW and PH are as follows:

Pros:

\- Allows UEs that do not need long eDRX cycles (\> 10.24 seconds) to
reuse NR Rel-16 DRX implementation without additional development work
and without a need for an explicit capability signalling.

\- NR already supports 10.24 seconds interval in C-DRX without using PTW
and PH.

\- For RRC\_INACTIVE, the same solution was adopted for LTE-MTC
connected to 5GC.

Cons:

\- Different solution from LTE for eDRX cycle = 10.24 seconds in
RRC\_IDLE.

\- Will impact 5GC and RAN2 will need to consult SA2/CT1 on the
feasibility.

\- UE cannot have multiple opportunities to receive its paging during an
eDRX cycle.

The following solutions can be considered for PTW and eDRX cycle
configuration for RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE:

\- A common PTW and eDRX cycle.

\- A common PTW but with different eDRX cycle.

\- A common eDRX cycle but with different PTW length.

\- Different eDRX cycle and different PTW length.

Two options should be considered for the deciding node for the eDRX
configuration for RRC\_INACTIVE:

**Option 1**: CN decides the eDRX parameters for RRC\_INACTIVE.

\- CN has better insight on the UE traffic profile.

\- Better for addressing potential core network impacts.

\- CN is responsible for eDRX in RRC\_IDLE (and UE needs to monitor for
CN paging also in RRC\_INACTIVE).

\- If RAN2 agrees to consider a common PTW and eDRX cycle configuration,
CN based eDRX configuration can be supported with minimum impact to
specifications where RAN follows the CN configured cycle. This common
configuration can additionally be justified by its simplicity and less
expected impacts to other WGs.

**Option 2**: RAN decides the eDRX parameters for RRC\_INACTIVE

\- It provides more flexibility to the RAN node in the configuration of
the eDRX parameters.

\- It allows RAN to configure different eDRX cycle for RRC INACTIVE.

\- In Rel-16 LTE-MTC connected to 5GC, NR-RAN chooses and configures the
final eDRX cycle for RRC\_INACTIVE (configuration is possible up to
10.24 seconds), based on idle mode eDRX cycle as provided by the AMF.

8.4 RRM relaxation for stationary devices
-----------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Description of feature

The study includes an objective on RRM relaxation for stationary RedCap
UEs. RAN2 recommends that irrespective of RRC state, it is under network
control whether to enable or disable RRM relaxation functionality for
RedCap UEs.

RAN2 has studied different types of classification of potential RedCap
UEs\' mobility states, e.g. possibility to introduce a stationary
mobility state. Considering the mobility of a RedCap UE, the
stationarity property would not be limited to fixed or immobile UEs, but
UEs which are considered stationary can also have low mobility, i.e., be
slightly moving. In addition, another mobility option for \"confined
mobility\" has been studied (see details in Enhancement 6 of triggering
criterion in 8.4.1.1).

RAN2 has studied different enhancements to triggering RRM measurement
relaxation and potential RRM relaxation methods for RRC\_IDLE,
RRC\_INACTIVE and RRC\_CONNECTED. RRM relaxation for neighboring cell
measurements for RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE is discussed in clause
8.4.2 and RRM relaxation for neighboring cells for RRC\_CONNECTED in
clause 8.4.3.

### 8.4.2 RRM relaxation in RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE

Rel-16 NR RRM relaxation procedures are taken as a baseline to study
further enhancements of neighbour cell RRM relaxation for RedCap UEs in
RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE.

For triggering neighbour cell RRM relaxation for RedCap UEs in RRC\_IDLE
and RRC\_INACTIVE, based on Rel-16 triggering criterion, the following
triggering enhancements can be considered (other solutions are not
precluded):

\- **Enhancement 1**: Introduce additional S~searchDeltaP\_stationary~
threshold to support 2-level speed evaluation (i.e. stationary and low
mobility), for example:

\- Stationary: (Srxlev~Ref~ -- Srxlev) \< S~SearchDeltaP\_stationary~

\- Low mobility: S~SearchDeltaP\_stationary~ \<= (Srxlev~Ref~ -- Srxlev)
\< S~SearchDeltaP\_low\_mobility~

Pros:

\- From specification point of view, it is simple and straightforward
enhancement based on Rel-16 mechanism.

\- It supports 2 levels speed evaluation (i.e. stationary and low
mobility), so it provides flexibility of designing different RRM
relaxation levels for different mobility scenarios.

Cons:

\- Unclear whether UE\'s mobility level can be accurately determined
because channel or link (RSRP/RSRQ) may change even if UE is purely
stationary, thus it may not be a reliable way to distinguish between
truly stationary and low mobility UE.

\- **Enhancement 2**: Introduce additional T~SearchDeltaP\_stationary~
to support 2-level speed evaluation (i.e. stationary and low mobility).

Pros:

\- From specification point of view, it is simple and straightforward
enhancement based on Rel-16 mechanism.

\- It supports 2 levels speed evaluation (i.e. stationary and low
mobility), so it provides flexibility of designing different RRM
relaxation levels for different mobility scenarios.

Cons:

\- Unclear whether UE\'s mobility level can be accurately determined.

Note: There can be synergies if Enhancement 1 is combined with
Enhancement 2.

\- **Enhancement 3**: Take into account changes in beam measurements in
serving cell when evaluating the mobility status of UE, e.g. based on
the number of beam changes, the beam can be the best beam or all beams
exceeding a threshold, for example:

Stationary:

\- number of beam changes \< N1 or

\- no beam change and (Srxlev~Ref~ -- Srxlev) \<
S~SearchDeltaP\_stationary~

Low mobility:

\- number of beam changes \< N2 or

\- S~SearchDeltaP\_stationary~ \<= (Srxlev~Ref~ -- Srxlev) \<
S~SearchDeltaP\_low\_mobility~

Pros:

\- Using beam level measurement results can assess UE\'s movement more
accurately than cell measurement, because UE may move among beams but
without changing the cell level results.

\- Potentially good for detecting \"circular motion\" around base
station.

Cons:

\- Unclear whether UE\'s mobility level can be accurately determined.

\- Beam level measurement results may fluctuate more than cell-level
results, so it might cause misjudgement.

**- Enhancement 4:** UE determines its stationary property based on
subscription information (e.g. USIM).

Pros:

\- It is simpler and faster than evaluating the quality of serving cell.

Cons:

\- Only applicable to limited scenarios, e.g. fixed-location devices.

\- Channel or link (RSRP/RSRQ) may change (e.g. may be low) even if UE
is fixed-location, RRM relaxation only depends on fixed-location
information may impact the performance if the UE is located at cell
edge.

**- Enhancement 5:** Introduce an additional S~searchDeltaP\_correction~
threshold and configure the UE to use it if only it detects that it
observes higher received signal power variation that do not violate
stationary property, i.e. rotating around itself, dynamically changing
multipath.

Pros:

\- Can be used to differentiate different stationary cases. E.g.
stationary or stationary with rotating around itself.

Cons:

\- Covers specific use case where device is rotating around itself.

**- Enhancement 6:** UE determines its confined mobility property based
on subscription information (e.g. USIM). This kind of device is expected
to be moving (slowly in many cases) or stationary, but different from
Enhancement 5, these UEs are not expected to move out of a localized
area in its lifetime.

Pros:

\- It is simpler and faster than evaluating the quality of serving cell.

\- If network can obtain the confined mobility status, network can also
use this information for other purpose in addition to RRM relaxation
(e.g. paging resource optimization).

Cons:

\- Only applicable to limited scenarios, e.g. devices with confined
mobility.

\- Channel or link (RSRP/RSRQ) may change for confined mobility devices,
RRM relaxation may impact the performance if the UE is located at cell
edge.

For neighbour cell RRM relaxation methods for RedCap UEs in RRC\_IDLE
and RRC\_INACTIVE, based on Rel-16 NR RRM relaxation methods, the
following relaxation methods enhancements can be considered (other
solutions are not precluded):

**- Enhancement 1:** UE can stop measurements on neighbour cells for T
(T\>\>1) hours.

Pros:

\- It is useful to further reduce power consumption for truly stationary
UEs.

Cons:

\- Based on evaluation in Clause E.2.1, the gain compared to 1-hour
measurement interval is not significant.

\- **Enhancement 2**: Enabling further relaxation by reducing the number
of the monitored reference signals (RS). UE only needs to measure
specific beams; thus, the power consumption can be reduced, and the time
period of measurement can be reduced.

\- **Enhancement 3**: UE only perform measurements on a number of
dedicated intra-frequency, inter-frequency cells.

Pros:

\- For stationary UEs, can avoid UE to measure all frequencies/cells
broadcast.

Cons:

\- May require additional effort for network planning and may require
network to indicate deployment related information to UE (e.g. neighbour
cells adjacent to each serving beam).

\- If the UE actually does moves or radio conditions change enough,
there may be a negative impact on cell-reselection.

**- Enhancement 4:** Minimize the number of measured frequencies.

Pros:

\- For stationary and confined mobility UEs, can avoid UE to measure all
frequencies/cells broadcast.

Cons:

\- If the UE actually does moves or radio conditions change enough,
there may be impact on cell-reselection.

\- May require additional signalling from the network to provide the UE
with potential frequencies to be used in IDLE/INACTIVE. And additional
signalling to allow/prohibit the UE from re-selecting to other
frequencies than provided by the network.

**-** **Enhancement 5**: Expand the Rel-16 scenario of performing \"stop
measurements for 1 hour\" for stationary UEs. This would help to further
reduce power consumption for a truly stationary UE.

**- Enhancement 6:** Upon UE fulfils the criterion (i.e. RSRP threshold
evaluation), UE can trigger measurement relaxation on part of configured
frequencies even if the criterion has not been fulfilled for a period of
T~SearchDeltaP~.

Pros:

\- UE can maximize its power saving on the measurements because
measurement relaxation can be started earlier.

Cons:

\- Without evaluating the duration of criterion has been fulfilled, it
may cause misjudgement due to weak robustness.

### 8.4.3 RRM relaxation in RRC\_CONNECTED

For neighbour cell RRM relaxation in RRC\_CONNECTED, due to the concern
on potential mobility performance impact, it is RAN2 recommendation that
\"fixed or immobile UEs\" are considered with higher priority than
\"slightly moving UEs\".

For assisting triggering neighbour cell RRM relaxation for RedCap UEs in
RRC\_CONNECTED, following solutions can be considered (other solutions
are not precluded):

**- Solution 1:** UE reports \"stationary\" status to network in Msg5.
How the mobility status is determined, e.g. left up to UE implementation
or based on measurements or location information, should be studied
further in normative phase, if it is to be considered.

Pros:

\- Allows UE to report to network if it is temporarily stationary, so
network can change its RRM configuration timely.

Cons:

\- Channel or link (RSRP/RSRQ) may change even if UE is stationary, so
it may impact handover performance if UE cannot cancel RRM relaxing
timely.

**- Solution 2:** Network provides (e.g. low mobility, not-at-cell-edge)
evaluation parameters to UE via dedicated signalling.

Pros:

\- Reusing Rel-16 mechanism in Connected UEs, maximize the commonality
with idle/inactive UEs.

\- Network can set evaluation parameters to UE, so it is more reliable
and impacts on performance can be reduced.

Cons:

\- Network needs to configure UE with additional parameters for
RRC\_CONNECTED.

\- The mobility status is determined by UE based on evaluation of
serving cell measurements. So, from network perspective, (compared to
other solutions) network does not know whether the UE is relaxing RRM
measurements or not.

**- Solution 3:** AMF sends \"stationary\" indication to gNB (based on
UE subscription).

Pros:

\- The information is derived from UE subscription information, such
fixed-location UE will not move, so performance impact can be minimized.

\- It is useful in potentially reducing the amount of measurements and
can enable network to configure more power-efficient RRM in
RRC\_CONNECTED.

Cons:

\- Only applicable to limited scenarios, e.g. fixed-location devices.

\- Channel or link (RSRP/RSRQ) may change even if UE is stationary, so
it may impact handover performance if UE cannot cancel RRM relaxing
timely.

\- **Solution 4**: UE reports \"stationary\" in UE Assistance
Information to network. How the mobility status is determined, e.g. left
up to UE implementation or based on measurements or location
information, should be studied further in normative phase.

Pros:

\- Allows UE to report to network if it is temporarily stationary, so
network can change its RRM configuration timely.

Cons:

\- Channel or link (RSRP/RSRQ) may change even if UE is purely
stationary, so it may impact handover performance if UE is located at
cell edge and cannot cancel RRM relaxing timely.

**- Solution 5:** Network enables measurement relaxation based on UE\'s
measurement report.

Pros:

\- It keeps the control fully on network side.

\- UE measurement report can be based on existing UE measurement report
mechanism.

Cons:

\- It relies on UE measurement reporting.

For neighbour cell RRM relaxation methods for RedCap UEs in
RRC\_CONNECTED, the exact mechanism, if any, will be decided by RAN4.
The following solutions have been discussed in RAN2:

\- **Solution 1**: Network does not configure measurements for mobility
purposes.

\- **Solution 2**: UE only performs measurement on single RS type.

From RAN2\'s perspective, other solutions are not precluded.

### 8.4.4 Analysis of UE power saving

Annex E.2 lists power saving results and analysis.

In summary, one source \[9\] presents plotted results for cases where
the DRX cycle is 1.28 seconds, the number of intra- and inter-frequency
cells is 8 with an SSB periodicity of 20 ms. The results are presented
with the average power consumption plotted against how often the UE
measures. The results show that power consumption does not change
significantly for measurement relaxation beyond one hour (one-hour
relaxation is the maximum possible in Rel-16).

One source \[10\] shows the power saving gain for serving cell RRM
relaxation in idle and connected mode. The simulation results show that
3 .6%\~13.4% power saving gain is observed when 4 times RRM relaxation
for serving cell is adopted by high SINR for idle/inactive UE.
Meanwhile, the results from \[6\] show that by increasing measurement
period 4 times for RRC\_CONNECTED UEs, 11.1% - 26.6% power saving gains
are observed, at the cost of an increase of handover failure rate from
0% to 0.26% for stationary or low mobility (e.g., 3 km/h) case.

In addition, one source \[11\] shows the average power consumption and
power saving gain when further expand the measurement interval from
using three times scaling factor to stopping measurement for 1 hour. The
result shows that for DRX cycle =1280 ms, stopping measurement for 1
hour can achieve power saving gain of 25.17% compared to 3-times
relaxation. In addition, \[11\] shows the time reduction and power
saving gain when the time duration for detecting/measuring SSBs can be
reduced by reducing the number of measured SSBs. The power saving gain
is 13.54% and 16.25% respectively if the time for SSBs
detection/measurement is reduced by 62.5% and 75%.

9 Coverage recovery
===================

9.0 Introduction to coverage recovery
-------------------------------------

Coverage recovery to compensate for potential coverage reduction due to
the device complexity reduction was studied. The evaluation methodology
is described in clause 6.3, evaluation results for different scenarios
are described in clause 9.1 with a summary of observations from the
evaluations in clause 9.1.5, and potential coverage recovery techniques
for different physical channels are described in clauses 9.2 through
9.4.

9.1 Coverage recovery evaluation
--------------------------------

### 9.1.1 Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz

For Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz, the bottleneck channel for the reference
NR UE and the corresponding maximum isotropic loss (MIL) value by the
sourcing companies \[3\] are shown in Table 9.1.1-1. More details are
provided in Annex C.1. The estimated coverage loss for the RedCap UE
relative to the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE is summarized
in Table 9.1.1-2 and Table 9.1.1-3. For every sourcing-company result,
the amount of compensation for each channel that has MIL below the
target value are highlighted. It is noted that the 3dB antenna
efficiency loss is assumed in both DL and UL for the RedCap UE.

Table 9.1.1-1: Bottleneck channel and MIL value for Reference NR UE in
Urban 2.6 GHz

  Intel          PUSCH                143.9

The representative values in the last row of Table 9.1.1-2 and Table
9.1.1-3 are derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from all the
companies results and excluding the highest and the lowest values when
the number of samples is more than 3. A negative value of the
representative value for a channel of the RedCap UE indicates the
coverage of the channel is worse than that of the bottleneck channel of
the reference NR UE.

As can be seen in the last row for the representative value, all the
channels except for PUSCH have better coverage than that of the
bottleneck channel thus requiring no compensation. On average, a
coverage degradation of approximately 3dB is observed for PUSCH.

It should be noted that the 3dB loss is resulted from the UE antenna
efficiency loss assumed for the wearable use cases. Furthermore, the
same target data rate of 1Mbps for PUSCH is assumed for both RedCap UE
and the reference UE (see evaluation methodology described in clause
6.3). A smaller or no coverage loss for PUSCH is expected if the target
data rate for RedCap UE is reduced.

### 9.1.2 Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz

For Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz, the bottleneck channel for the reference
NR UE and the corresponding maximum isotropic loss (MIL) value by the
sourcing companies \[3\] are shown in Table 9.1.2-1. More details are
provided in Annex C.2. The estimated coverage loss for the RedCap UE in
rural scenario at 0.7 GHz, relative to the bottleneck channel of the
reference NR UE is summarized in Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3. For
every sourcing-company result, the amount of compensation for each
channel that has MIL below the target value are highlighted. It is noted
that the 3dB antenna efficiency loss is assumed in both DL and UL for
the RedCap UE.

The representative values in the last row of Table 9.1.2-2 and Table
9.1.2-3 are derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from all the
companies results and excluding the highest and the lowest values when
the number of samples is more than 3. A negative value of the
representative value for a channel of the RedCap UE indicates the
coverage of the channel is worse than that of the bottleneck channel of
the reference NR UE.

As can be seen in the last row for the representative value, all the
channels except for PUSCH and Msg3 have better coverage than that of the
bottleneck channel thus requiring no compensation. On average, a
coverage degradation of approximately 2.8 dB and 1 dB, respectively is
observed for PUSCH and Msg3.

It should be noted that the 3 dB loss is resulted from the UE antenna
efficiency loss assumed for the wearable use cases. Furthermore, the
same target data rate of 100 kbps for PUSCH is assumed for both RedCap
UE and the reference NR UE (see evaluation methodology described in
clause 6.3). A smaller or no coverage loss for PUSCH is expected if the
target data rate for RedCap UE is reduced.

### 9.1.3 Urban scenario at 4 GHz

For Urban scenario at 4 GHz, the bottleneck channel for the reference NR
UE and the corresponding maximum isotropic loss (MIL) value by the
sourcing companies \[3\] are shown in Table 9.1.3-1. More details are
provided in Annex C.3.

For RedCap UE with 1 Rx and 2 Rx, the MIL loss relative to the
bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE is studied under different
downlink power spectrum density assumptions. For DL PSD 33 dBm/MHz, the
estimated coverage loss for 1 Rx and 2 Rx is summarized in Table 9.1.3-2
and Table 9.1.3-3, respectively. For DL PSD 24 dBm/MHz, the estimated
coverage loss for 1 Rx and 2 Rx is summarized in Table 9.1.3-4 and Table
9.1.3-5, respectively. For every sourcing-company result, the amount of
compensation for each channel that has MIL below the target value are
highlighted. It is noted that the 3dB antenna efficiency loss is assumed
in both DL and UL for the RedCap UE.

Urban 4 GHz

  Lenovo         PUSCH                148.3

The representative values in the last row of Table 9.1.3-2 to Table
9.1.3-5 are derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from all the
companies results and excluding the highest and the lowest values when
the number of samples is more than 3. A negative value of the
representative value for a channel of the RedCap UE indicates the
coverage of the channel is worse than that of the bottleneck channel of
the reference NR UE.

As can be seen in the last row for the representative value, all uplink
channels except for PUSCH have better coverage than that of the
bottleneck channel thus requiring no compensation. On average, a
coverage degradation of approximately 3dB is observed for PUSCH.

It should be noted that the 3dB loss is resulted from the UE antenna
efficiency loss assumed for the wearable use cases. Furthermore, the
same target data rate of 1 Mbps for PUSCH is assumed for both RedCap UE
and the reference NR UE (see evaluation methodology described in clause
6.3). A smaller or no coverage loss for PUSCH is expected if the target
data rate for RedCap UE is reduced.

As seen from Table 9.1.3-2 and Table 9.1.3-3, for DL PSD 33 dBm/MHz, all
the downlink channels are not coverage limited for both 1 Rx and 2 Rx
RedCap UEs. For DL PSD 24 dBm/MHz and 2 Rx RedCap UE, a coverage
degradation of approximately 1.1 dB is observed for Msg2 as seen from
Table 9.1.3-4. For DL PSD 24 dBm/MHz and 1 Rx RedCap UE, a coverage
degradation of approximately 6.2 dB, 2.5 dB and 0.8 dB, respectively is
observed for Msg2, Msg4 and PDCCH CSS as seen from Table 9.1.3-5. It
should be noted that for DL PSD 24 dBm/MHz case, Msg2 results are based
on no TBS scaling.

### 9.1.4 Indoor scenario at 28 GHz

For indoor scenario at 28 GHz, the bottleneck channel for the reference
NR UE and the corresponding maximum isotropic loss (MIL) value by the
sourcing companies \[3\] are shown in Table 9.1.4-1. More details are
provided in Annex C.4. It is noted that max TRP 12 dBm is assumed for
both the reference NR UE and RedCap UE. For results presented by
companies assuming max TRP 23 dBm, the corresponding MIL values have
been reduced by 11dB.

For RedCap UE with 1 Rx and 2 Rx, the MIL loss relative to the
bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE is studied under different
maximum UE bandwidth assumptions. The estimated coverage loss for
maximum 100 MHz BW and 1 Rx RedCap UE is summarized in Table 9.1.4-2.
The estimated coverage loss for maximum 50 MHz BW and 1 Rx and 2 Rx is
summarized in Table 9.1.4-3 and Table 9.1.4-4, respectively. For every
sourcing-company result, the amount of compensation for each channel
that has MIL below the target value are highlighted.

Table 9.1.4-1: Bottleneck channel and MIL values for Reference NR UE in
indoor 28 GHz

  InterDigital   PUSCH                132.4
  Qualcomm       PUSCH                127.8
  Intel          PUSCH                126.4

The representative values in the last row of Table 9.1.4-2 to Table
9.1.4-4 are derived by taking the mean value (in dB domain) from all the
companies results and excluding the highest and the lowest values when
the number of samples is more than 3. A negative value of the
representative value for a channel of the RedCap UE indicates the
coverage of the channel is worse than that of the bottleneck channel of
the reference NR UE.

As can be seen in the last row for the representative value, all uplink
channels are not coverage limited for the RedCap UE with either better
or similar coverage as the bottleneck channel of the reference NR UE.
This is because at FR2 there is no assumption of reduced antenna
efficiency for the RedCap UE and UL coverage is expected to be same as
the reference NR UE.

For RedCap UE with maximum 100MHz BW and 1Rx, although there is
performance loss from reducing the number of Rx branches to 1, the
representative values of all the downlink channels are larger than zero
indicating a better performance than the bottleneck channel of the
reference NR UE.

For RedCap UE with maximum 50MHz BW and 2Rx, the similar observation can
be drawn. The MIL(s) of all the downlink channels are better than that
of the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE.

For RedCap UE with maximum 50MHz BW and 1Rx, an averaged coverage
degradation of approximately 2.2 dB is observed for PDSCH. This is
because a same target data rate (i.e. 25 Mbps) is assumed even maximum
UE bandwidth is reduced by half. A smaller or no coverage loss for PDSCH
is expected if the target data rate for RedCap UE with maximum 50MHz BW
is reduced.

Note 1: All sources assume no TBS scaling for Msg2 evaluation

Note 2: Most of the Msg4 results are based on MCS0. However, a few
results are based on a higher MCS

### 9.1.5 Summary of coverage recovery evaluation

In summary, based on the evaluation results, the following observations
can be made.

For FR1:

\- For FR1, under the consideration of potential reduced antenna
efficiency due to device size limitations, the MIL(s) of PUSCH and/or
Msg3 are worse than that of the bottleneck channel for the reference NR
UE and coverage recovery is needed. The amount of coverage recovery is
up to 3 dB. For other UL channels, coverage recovery may be not needed.

\- For RedCap UE with 2 Rx and reduced antenna efficiency, dependent on
frequency bands and the assumption of DL PSD, the need for coverage
recovery can be different.

\- For carrier frequency of 4 GHz with DL PSD 24 dBm/MHz, coverage
recovery may be needed for the downlink channels of Msg2. A small or
moderate compensation can be considered, where the square brackets
indicate that the exact amount will depend on the techniques, scenarios,
etc.:

\- \[1 dB\] for Msg2 without TBS scaling. It is noted that coverage loss
for Msg2 can be compensated by using the existing TBS scaling technique.

\- For other carrier frequencies or DL PSD of 33 dBm/MHz, coverage
recovery is not needed for the downlink channels if the target for
coverage recovery is based on the MIL of the bottleneck channel for the
reference NR UE.

\- For RedCap UE with 1 Rx and reduced antenna efficiency, dependent on
frequency bands and the assumption of DL PSD, the need for coverage
recovery can be different.

\- For carrier frequency of 4 GHz with DL PSD 24 dBm/MHz, coverage
recovery may be needed for the downlink channels of Msg2, Msg4 and PDCCH
CSS. A small or moderate compensation can be considered, where the
square brackets indicate that the exact amount will depend on the
techniques, scenarios, etc.:

\- \[1 dB\] for PDCCH CSS

\- \[2-3 dB\] for Msg4

\- \[6 dB\] for Msg2 without TBS scaling. It is noted that coverage loss
for Msg2 can be compensated by using the existing TBS scaling technique.

\- For other carrier frequencies or DL PSD of 33 dBm/MHz, coverage
recovery is not needed for the downlink channels if the target for
coverage recovery is based on the MIL of the bottleneck channel for the
reference NR UE.

> \- It is noted that in the methodology for RedCap UE coverage recovery
> target determination, absolute ISD/MPL targets are not considered.
>
> \- The determination of which channels require coverage recovery and
> the amount of coverage recovery depend on the choice of the target for
> coverage recovery.

For FR2:

\- For FR2, there is no assumption of reduced antenna efficiency for
RedCap UE and the MIL of the UL channels is the same as the reference NR
UE and coverage recovery for UL channels is not needed.

\- For RedCap UE with 100 MHz BW and 1Rx in FR2 indoor scenario,
although there is performance loss from reducing the number of Rx
branches to 1, the MIL(s) of all the DL channels is better that that of
the bottleneck channel for the reference NR UE, for which max TRP 12dBm
is assumed, and coverage recovery for DL channels is thus not needed.

\- For RedCap UE with 50MHz BW and 1Rx, coverage recovery may be needed
for PDSCH when the same target data rate as the reference NR UE is
assumed, and the amount of coverage recovery to be considered is
approximately \[2-3 dB\] , where the square brackets indicate that the
exact amount will depend on the techniques, scenarios, etc.

\- The trade-off between data rate and coverage can be considered and
the amount of coverage recovery may depend on this choice.

\- The determination of which channels require coverage recovery and the
amount of coverage recovery depend on the choice of the target for
coverage recovery and/or max TRP for the reference NR UE.

\- E.g. coverage recovery may not be needed for FR2 indoor scenario when
the target is based on an MPL value from a target ISD of 20m.

\- E.g. coverage recovery for some DL channels may be needed for RedCap
UE with 100 MHz BW (e.g. Msg2/4, PDSCH) or 50 MHz BW (e.g. Msg2/4,
PDSCH, PDCCH) and 1Rx when max TRP 23 dBm is assumed for the reference
NR UE.

9.2 Coverage recovery for PUSCH
-------------------------------

### 9.2.1 Description of coverage recovery features

Coverage recovery for PUSCH has been studied, including both PUSCH for
data and Msg3.

Coverage recovery for PUSCH data was studied from several aspects,
including cross-slot or cross-repetition channel estimation, lower DM-RS
density in time domain, enhancements on PUSCH repetition Type A and/or
Type B, frequency hopping or BWP switching across a larger system
bandwidth.

Some techniques, such as cross-slot or cross-repetition channel
estimation, lower DM-RS density in time domain, enhancements on PUSCH
repetition Type A and/or Type B have been studied also in the Rel-17
Coverage Enhancement SI \[5\].

the use of the lower-MCS table, larger aggregation factor for PDSCH
reception, cross-slot or cross-repetition channel estimation, increasing
the granularity of PRB bundling, frequency hopping or BWP switching
across a larger system bandwidth.

Some techniques, such as the lower-MCS table and larger aggregation
factor for PDSCH reception are existing techniques with optional UE
capability signalling.

including TBS scaling and Msg2 PDSCH repetition.

It is noted that TBS scaling is an existing technique mandatory for
Rel-15 UE.

supported, potential specification impacts include:

\- PDSCH hopping configuration

\- Faster switching/RF retuning time

bundling include:

\- Related signaling design

\- Related signaling design

9.4 Coverage recovery for PDCCH
-------------------------------

### 9.4.1 Description of coverage recovery features

Type0/0A/1/2/3-PDCCH CSS) was studied from several aspects, including
PDCCH repetition, compact DCI, new AL of 12, 24 or 32, PDCCH
transmission via CORESET or search space bundling, PDCCH-less mechanism
for SIB1 and/or SI message.

### 9.4.2 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

It is noted that some of the techniques may have compatibility issue if
RedCap and normal UEs share the same initial DL BWP.

### 9.4.3 Analysis of specification impacts

10 Definition and constraining of reduced capabilities
======================================================

10.1 Definition of reduced capabilities
---------------------------------------

At least for RedCap UE identification, explicit definition of RedCap UE
type(s) is needed. Pending conclusions on the reduced complexity
features (as described in clauses 7 and 12) and RedCap UE identification
(as described in clause 11), the definition of the RedCap UE types can
be based on one of:

\- Option 1: All the reduced capabilities recommended at the end of the
RedCap study

\- Option 2: Only include the reduced capabilities that the network
needs to know during initial access, if any.

\- Option 3: All the recommended reduced capabilities as well as
recommended power saving features

\- Option 4: The corresponding minimum set of the reduced capabilities
that one RedCap UE type shall mandatorily support

If early identification during initial access is supported, at least
maximum supported UE bandwidth during initial access (20 MHz for FR1 and
100 MHz for FR2) is included in the set of L1 capabilities of the device
type for RedCap early identification. Note that this does not preclude
the case where the early indication only indicates whether it is a
RedCap UE or which type of the RedCap UEs if multiple UE types are
defined.

As a baseline, the existing UE capabilities framework is used to
indicate the capabilities of RedCap UEs. As currently specified in
Rel-16, the UE reports its radio access capabilities at least when the
network requests the UE to do so.

The network should be able to control whether RedCap UEs can access the
cell and differentiate them from other, non-RedCap UEs. The number of
different UE types should be minimised to reduce market fragmentation,
and UE types should be introduced only where essential to control UE
accesses and differentiate them from other non-RedCap UEs.

The UE capabilities can be categorized as:

\- Minimum mandatory capabilities that all RedCap UEs support, if
identified.

\- Optional capabilities, to be signalled explicitly.

For capability signalling of RedCap UEs, the following scenarios are
possible, however feasibility, applicability of the cases and the final
division to categories depend on the exact RedCap capabilities (to be
defined):

\- For the features that are mandatory for non-Redcap UEs:

\- The Redcap UE mandatorily supports the feature with the same value.

\- The Redcap UE mandatorily supports the feature, but with different
value (e.g. bandwidth value).

\- The Redcap UE optionally supports the feature.

\- The Redcap UE does not support the feature at all.

\- For the features that are optional for non-Redcap UEs:

\- The Redcap UE does not support the feature at all.

\- The Redcap UE supports the feature with a different value.

\- The Redcap UE supports the feature with the same value.

\- The Redcap UE mandatorily supports the feature.

Based on the above categorization and possible scenarios, the following
capability design principle alternatives can be considered:

Alternative 1:

\- The UE capability requirements for a RedCap device type, that are
different from those for non-RedCap UEs, are listed in the
specifications. That is:

\- Mandatory features for non-RedCap UEs that are not applicable for
RedCap UEs.

\- Mandatory features for non-RedCap UEs that are optional for RedCap
UEs.

\- Mandatory features for non-RedCap UEs that are supported for RedCap
UEs but with different value.

\- Optional features for non-RedCap UE that are not applicable for
RedCap UE.

\- Optional features for non-RedCap UE that are mandatorily supported
for RedCap UE.

For a RedCap device type, define new signalling fields in UE capability
signalling for the features that are mandatory without capability
signalling for non-RedCap UEs but are optional for Redcap UEs, or
mandatory with capability signalling for non-RedCap UEs but with
different value for RedCap UEs. Such new signalling is only applicable
for RedCap UEs.

Alternative 2:

\- Directly define the UE capabilities required for RedCap devices,
including:

\- Mandatory features for RedCap UEs (defined in specification).

\- Optional features for Redcap UEs (introduce signalling fields in an
independent container defined specifically for Redcap UE).

The network should know whether the UE is a RedCap UE or not in order to
handle UE capabilities properly (see also Clause 11.1 on UE
identification). The following options, which do not need to be mutually
exclusive, can be considered for further analysis and down-selection:

\- Option 1: RedCap device type is indicated as part of the capability
signalling.

\- Option 2: Define a new IE specifically for RedCap UEs containing
RedCap-specific capabilities. The IE is included in the signalling only
by Redcap UEs.

\- Option 3: The network identifies RedCap UEs based on identification
solution (see Clause 11.1), e.g. during Msg1, Msg3, MsgA, etc, (pending
RAN1 conclusion). The identification is forwarded it to target gNB
during handover.

\- Option 4: The network identifies RedCap UE based on the reported
capabilities, assuming the identification can be done through
RedCap-specific capabilities not used by non-RedCap UEs.

From RAN2 perspective, the pros and cons to define only one device type
or multiple device types are:

Only one RedCap UE type:

Pros:

\- No market fragmentation of \"types\".

\- Simpler specification, e.g. on early identification, access control,
etc.

\- Avoid non-technical discussion outside 3GPP\'s scope, e.g. product
management, similar to the discussions on LTE categories.

Cons:

\- Cannot provide independent access control for different UE types, if
this was deemed necessary.

Multiple RedCap UE types:

Pros:

\- Flexible access control is possible if necessary, e.g. independent
access control for different UE types.

Cons:

\- Potential market fragmentation of \'types\' leading to loss of
economies of scale and increased device costs.

\- More specification complexity/effort, e.g. on early identification,
access control, etc.

\- May lead to non-technical discussion outside 3GPP\'s scope, e.g.
product management, similar to the discussions on LTE categories.

The need on independent access control for different RedCap UE types is
not discussed in the SI phase.

10.2 Constraining of reduced capabilities
-----------------------------------------

### 10.2.1 Description of feature

The study also includes an objective on how to ensure RedCap UEs are
only used for intended use cases, that is, UE identifying as RedCap UE
can only use services and resources intended for RedCap UE type. The
following potential solutions can be considered (the solutions do not
need to be mutually exclusive):

\- **Option 1**: RRC Reject based approach

When the network knows the UE is a RedCap UE and the type of the service
requested, RAN can reject an RRC connection establishment attempt if the
service the UE requests is not allowed for RedCap UEs. The service type
can be known, e.g., based on the establishment cause provided in Msg3,
through higher layer mechanisms or other ways.

\- **Option 2**: Subscription validation (Note: SA2, CT1 confirmation is
needed)

During the RRC connection setup, the UE indicates that it is a RedCap UE
to the core network, e.g.

\- UE includes this indication in NAS signalling message to core
network; or

> \- UE informs this indication during its RRC connection establishment
> procedure to RAN; RAN then informs core network of the UE\'s RedCap
> type in the Initial UE Context message to core network.

The network validates UE\'s indication against its subscription plan,
which includes information such as the set of services allowed for the
UE. Network then decides whether to accept or reject UE\'s registration
request. For example, network may reject UE if UE indicates RedCap, but
its subscription does not include any RedCap-specific services.

\- **Option 3**: Verification of RedCap UE

Network performs capability match between UE\'s reported radio
capabilities and the set of capability criteria associated with UE\'s
RedCap type.

\- **Option 4**: Left up to network implementation to ensure RedCap UE
uses intended services and/or resources.

The decision on which option or options to choose will be made during a
possible normative phase, and if needed, based on consultation with
other working groups (e.g. SA2, CT1).

11 UE identification and access restrictions
============================================

11.1 UE identification
----------------------

### 11.1.1 Description of feature

RedCap UEs need to be identified in order to ensure the network can
provide services properly in the cell, e.g., to schedule messages and to
possibly restrict the UE\'s access to the network.

The necessity on when RedCap UE needs to be identified depends on when
the network needs to have information of the UE type in order to
properly schedule the UE e.g. during the initial access.

Feasibility, necessity, pros and cons for the following schemes for
identification of RedCap UEs have been studied:

\- Option 1: During Msg1 transmission

\- E.g., via separate initial UL BWP, separate PRACH resource, or PRACH
preamble partitioning

\- Option 2: During Msg3 transmission

\- Option 3: Post Msg4 acknowledgment.

\- E.g., during Msg5 transmission or part of UE capability reporting

\- Option 4: During MsgA transmission

\- E.g., via separate initial UL BWP, or in MsgA preamble part via
separate PRACH resource or PRACH preamble partitioning, or in MsgA PUSCH
part

The following observations have been made regarding Option 1, Option 2,
Option 3 and Option 4.

**Option 1: During Msg1 transmission:**

Feasibility: Identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of
Msg1 could be feasible from the perspective of RAN1, at least for the
following solutions:

\- Separation of PRACH resources (e.g., occasions and/or formats) or
PRACH preambles between RedCap and non-RedCap UEs

\- Separation of initial UL BWP for RedCap and non-RedCap UEs

The appropriateness of each solution, considering the number of UE
type(s) to be indicated, etc., would need further considerations.

Necessity: Early identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission
of Msg1 may be necessary for:

\- Coverage recovery (including link adaptation) for one or more of:
Msg2 PDCCH/PDSCH, Msg3 PUSCH and PDCCH scheduling Msg3 retransmission,
Msg4 PDCCH/PDSCH or PUCCH in response to Msg4, Msg5 PUSCH and associated
PDCCH, if it is determined that coverage recovery for RedCap UEs is
necessary for one of more of these channels

\- Identifying UE minimum processing times capabilities for PDSCH
processing and PUSCH preparation, if relaxations to UE min processing
times are defined for N~1~ and N~2~

\- Identifying UE capability for UL modulation order for Msg3 and Msg5
scheduling, if relaxations to max UL modulation order (i.e., UL
modulation order restricted to lower than 64QAM) are introduced

\- Identifying UE max bandwidth capability for Msg3 and Msg5 scheduling
and PUCCH in response to Msg4

Exact necessity depends on outcome of studies on UE cost/complexity
reduction and coverage recovery, and the SI on Coverage Enhancements
\[5\].

Pros and cons: The pros and cons listed in Table 11.1.1-1 are identified
for identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of Msg1.

Table 11.1.1-1: Pros and cons for identification of RedCap UE type(s)
during transmission of Msg1

  **Pros**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          **Cons**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Enables efficient handling of different UE minimum processing times between RedCap and non-RedCap UEs for: minimum timing between PDSCH carrying RAR and start of Msg3 PUSCH; minimum timing between PDSCH carrying Msg4 and the corresponding HARQ-ACK feedback; minimum timing between PDCCH with the retransmission grant and the corresponding Msg3 PUSCH retransmission, if relaxed UE min processing times are introduced for RedCap UEs.   Potential reduction in PRACH user capacity (for the options based on separation of PRACH preambles), impacting both RedCap and non-RedCap UEs respectively, e.g., if the total PRACH resources in the cell is not increased. The exact impact depends on numbers of device type(s)/sub-types/capabilities to be identified and exact details of PRACH preamble partitioning schemes.
  Enables coverage recovery, including link adaptation, for any one or more of: broadcast PDCCH, PDSCH associated with Msg2, PDSCH associated with Msg4, and PUSCH associated with Msg3, if coverage recovery is needed for these channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                         Potential increase in UL OH from PRACH (for the options based on separation of PRACH resources), impacting both RedCap and non-RedCap UEs.
  The option of configuring separate initial UL BWPs, in addition to the above pros, enables address congestion (if congestion may occur) in the initial UL BWP that may otherwise need to be restricted to the mandatory required BW for RedCap UEs in the band/FR.                                                                                                                                                                                Potential increase in UL OH and complexity in configuration and maintenance of multiple initial UL BWP for the gNB, for the option of configuring separate initial UL BWPs.
  Enables RRC connection rejection of RedCap UE for access restriction (for UEs coming from RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE if the UE context is not found).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The indication mechanisms in this category may be limiting in terms of the number of further sub-types/capabilities within RedCap device type that may be distinguished, if such sub-types/capability indication are introduced.
  Makes it possible to differentiate or enable prioritization of non-RedCap UEs vs. RedCap UEs during contention resolution if RedCap UE type is visible to MAC layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Higher impact to RAN1 and RAN2 specifications as well as increased SIB signalling OH compared to other options.
  Enables the RedCap UE to operate in an initial BWP which is wider than the RedCap UE bandwidth, as the gNB can take into account UE RF-retuning time while transmitting RAR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
  Enables handling of different processing delay requirements (if such are agreed and specified) for RRC procedures between RedCap and non-RedCap i.e. RRC Setup -\> RRC Setup Complete and RRC Resume and RRC Resume Complete delays.                                                                                                                                                                                                              

**Option 2: During Msg3 transmission:**

Feasibility: Identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of
Msg3 may be feasible, at least for the following solutions:

\- Using the spare bit in existing Msg3 definition

\- Extending the Msg3 size to carry additional one or more bits,
indicating RedCap UE type(s)

\- Introduction of new larger RRC message (e.g. on CCCH1)

\- New MAC control element or LCID

The option of carrying identification as part of UCI multiplexed in Msg3
PUSCH was not studied. The appropriateness and feasibility of each
solution, considering the number of UE type(s) to be indicated, coverage
performance for Msg3, etc., would need further considerations.

Necessity: If early identification of RedCap UE type(s) via Option 1 is
not supported, identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission
of Msg3 may be necessary for coverage recovery (including link
adaptation) for one or more of: Msg4 PDCCH/PDSCH, Msg5 PUSCH and
associated PDCCH. Exact necessity depends on outcome of studies on
coverage recovery and the SI on Coverage Enhancements \[5\].

From higher layer perspective, whether it is needed for the network to
identify a RedCap UE during reception of Msg3 depends on whether Msg4
and/or Msg5 need special handling and whether there is a need to provide
opportunity for the network to reject connection establishment based on
that the UE is a RedCap UE.

Pros and cons: The pros and cons listed in Table 11.1.1-2 are identified
for identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of Msg3.

Table 11.1.1-2: Pros and cons for identification of RedCap UE type(s)
during transmission of Msg3

  **Pros**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               **Cons**
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Enables coverage recovery (if needed) and/or appropriate link adaptation for PDSCH (and associated PDCCH and PUCCH) for Msg4, and scheduling of Msg5.                                                                                  If only the spare bit in Msg3 is used, it would consume the single spare bit currently available in Msg3 payload, and this may not be desirable.
  Limited impact to RAN1 specifications if only the spare bit in Msg3 payload is utilized.                                                                                                                                               If extended Msg3 size is introduced, mechanisms to enable detection between use of legacy Msg3 and extended Msg3 definitions necessary.
  The option of extending Msg3 size may offer good scalability in the number of bits for such UE identification; e.g., if sub-types of RedCap device types (if defined) are to be indicated in Msg3.                                     The option of only using the spare bit in Msg3 scales poorly -- limiting to a single-bit indication may not be sufficient if intending to distinguish between further sub-types/capabilities within RedCap device type, if RedCap UE sub-types/capabilities are defined in the context of RedCap UE identification.
  Enables RRC connection rejection of RedCap UE for access restriction (for UEs coming from RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE if the UE context is not found).                                                                                 Cannot facilitate additional coverage recovery (including separate link adaptation) for broadcast PDCCH and/or Msg2 PDSCH, and/or Msg3 PUSCH (and associated PDCCH) for RedCap UEs.
  Makes it possible to differentiate or enable prioritization of non-RedCap UEs vs. RedCap UEs during contention resolution if RedCap UE type is visible to MAC layer.                                                                   If UE minimum processing times are relaxed, cannot facilitate scheduling with separate minimum timing relationships for RedCap UEs (compared to non-RedCap UEs) between PDSCH carrying RAR and start of Msg3 PUSCH; minimum timing between PDCCH with the retransmission grant and the corresponding Msg3 PUSCH retransmission. This could result in increased initial access latency for non-RedCap UEs.
  Enables handling of different processing delay requirements (if such are agreed and specified) for RRC procedures between RedCap and non-RedCap i.e. RRC Setup -\> RRC Setup Complete and RRC Resume and RRC Resume Complete delays.   May degrade reliability/coverage of Msg3 in case of increased Msg3 payload size.

**Option 3: Post Msg4 transmission:**

Feasibility: Identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of
Msg5 or as part of UE capability reporting are feasible options from the
perspective of RAN1. From RAN2 perspective this is already covered by
existing signalling with limited specification impact.

Necessity: If early identification of RedCap UE type(s) via Options 1,
2, or 4 are not supported, then RedCap UE type(s) need to be identified
either during transmission of Msg5 or as part of UE capability
reporting.

Pros and cons: The pros and cons listed in Table 11.1.1-3 are identified
for identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of Msg5 or
in UE capability report.

Table 11.1.1-3: Pros and cons for identification of RedCap UE type(s)
during transmission of Msg5 or in UE capability report

  **Pros**                                                                                                                                                                                   **Cons**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This option of UE capability reporting offers a simple option for indication of RedCap UE type, including possibility of indicating further RedCap sub-types/capabilities if introduced.   Cannot facilitate additional coverage recovery (if needed) or separate link adaptation for broadcast PDCCH and/or Msg2 and/or Msg4 PDSCH, and/or Msg3 PUSCH for RedCap UEs. Too conservative scheduling and link adaptation for all UEs imply increased system OH for initial access in the initial DL and UL BWPs.
  Limited or no impact to RAN1 and RAN2 specifications.                                                                                                                                      If UE minimum processing times are relaxed, cannot facilitate scheduling with separate minimum timing relationships for RedCap UEs between PDSCH carrying RAR and start of Msg3 PUSCH; minimum timing between PDSCH carrying Msg4 and the corresponding HARQ-ACK feedback; minimum timing between PDCCH with the retransmission grant and the corresponding Msg3 PUSCH retransmission. This could result in increased initial access latency for non-RedCap UEs.
                                                                                                                                                                                             Cannot address the issue where Msg3 or PUCCH in response to Msg4 or Msg5 is scheduled with a bandwidth/hopping range larger than the maximum RedCap UE bandwidth in the UL initial BWP.
                                                                                                                                                                                             Cannot enable RRC connection rejection of RedCap UE for RedCap-specific access restriction (for UEs coming from RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE if the UE context is not found)

**Option 4: During MsgA transmission:**

Feasibility: Identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of
MsgA could be feasible, at least for the following solutions:

\- Separation of 2-step RACH resources (e.g., occasions and/or formats)
or MsgA preambles between RedCap and non-RedCap UEs

\- Separation of initial UL BWP for RedCap and non-RedCap UEs

\- Using a new indication in MsgA PUSCH part

The appropriateness of each solution, considering the number of UE
type(s) to be indicated, etc., would need further considerations.

Necessity: Early identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission
of MsgA may be necessary for:

\- Coverage recovery (including link adaptation) for MsgA transmission
(UE selection of RedCap specific 2-step resources, i.e. MsgA indication
in preamble part).

\- Coverage recovery (including link adaptation) for MsgB and later
messages, and associated PDCCH.

Pros and cons: Due to the differences the pros and cons for
identification of RedCap UE type(s) during transmission of MsgA with
indication in the MsgA preamble part are listed in Table 11.1.1-4, and
the pros and cons for identification of RedCap UE type(s) during
transmission of MsgA with indication in the MsgA PUSCH part are listed
in Table 11.1.1-5.

  Enables coverage recovery, including link adaptation, for any one or more of: MsgA, broadcast PDCCH, PDSCH associated with MsgB.                                                                                                                             Potential reduction in 2-step RACH user capacity (for the option based on separation of PRACH preambles), impacting both RedCap and non-RedCap UEs respectively, e.g., if the total 2-step RACH resources in the cell is not increased. The exact impact depends on numbers of device type(s)/sub-types/capabilities to be identified and exact details of PRACH preamble partitioning schemes.
  The option of configuring separate initial UL BWPs, in addition to the above pros, address congestion (if congestion may occur) in the initial UL BWP that may otherwise need to be restricted to the mandatory required BW for RedCap UEs in the band/FR.   Potential increase in UL OH from 2-step PRACH (for the options based on separation of PRACH resources), impacting both RedCap and non-RedCap UEs.
  Enables RRC connection rejection of RedCap UE for access restriction (for UEs coming from RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE if the UE context is not found).                                                                                                       Potential increase in UL OH and complexity in configuration and maintenance of multiple initial UL BWP for the gNB, for the option of configuring separate initial UL BWPs.
  Makes it possible to differentiate or enable prioritization of non-RedCap UEs vs. RedCap UEs during contention resolution if RedCap UE type is visible to MAC layer.                                                                                         The indication mechanisms in this category may be limiting in terms of the number of further sub-types/capabilities within RedCap device type that may be distinguished, if such sub-types/capability indication are introduced.
  In case of fallback from 2-step to 4-step RACH during MsgA PUSCH failure, possibility for coverage recovery.                                                                                                                                                 Higher impact to RAN1 and RAN2 specifications as well as increased SIB signalling OH compared to other options.

  Enables RRC connection rejection of RedCap UE for access restriction (for UEs coming from RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE if the UE context is not found).                                                 Either MsgA PUSCH part need to be differentiated for RedCap UEs and non-RedCap UEs, or the will be impact on non-RedCap UEs from the increases MsgA PUSCH size.
  More limited impact to specifications                                                                                                                                                                  May degrade reliability/coverage of MsgA PUSCH in case of increased MsgA PUSCH payload size.
  The option of MsgA PUSCH indication may offer good scalability in the number of bits for such UE identification, e.g., if sub-types of RedCap device types (if defined) are to be indicated in MsgA.   Cannot provide coverage recovery in case of PUSCH failure and fallback to 4-step RACH.
  Makes it possible to differentiate or enable prioritization of non-RedCap UEs vs. RedCap UEs during contention resolution if RedCap UE type is visible to MAC layer.                                   

11.2 Access restrictions
------------------------

### 11.2.1 Description of feature

NG-RAN supports overload and access control functionality such as RACH
back off, RRC Connection Reject, RRC Connection Release and UE based
access barring mechanisms. The purpose of the feature is to not only
provide the same functionality as for legacy UEs but to have RedCap
specific access restrictions to be able to avoid or limit negative
impact on legacy performance.

### 11.2.2 Cell barring

For RedCap UEs, an explicit or implicit indication in broadcast system
information can be used to indicate whether a RedCap UE can camp on the
cell or not. If a RedCap UE is not allowed to camp on a cell or the
RedCap UE considers the cell as barred, it could be of interest to bar
all cells on the frequency to ensure RedCap UEs only camp on the
strongest cell. Legacy UEs have the same functionality and the IE
intraFreqReselection configures in the UE should consider only the
current cell as barred or all cells on the frequency. For RedCap it
remains to be determined if the functionality should be controlled by
the same intraFreqReselection IE or if a new separate parameter should
be introduced.

### 11.2.3 Unified access control

The unified access control (UAC) framework is specified in TS 22.261 and
it applies to all UEs in RRC\_IDLE, RRC\_CONNECTED and RRC\_INACTIVE.
This mechanism should also apply to RedCap UEs to control RedCap UEs
accesses to the network. In UAC each access attempt is associated with
an Access Category and one or more Access Identities (defined in TS
24.501). As baseline, the legacy principles apply to RedCap UEs and
further details on using Access Identitiy(ies) and Access Categories are
to be discussed during normative phase. One option, also to be discussed
further in the normative phase, is that the network is able to
differentiate between RedCap and non-RedCap UEs using UAC.

The possible solutions for RedCap UAC that have been considered in the
study are the following (the options do not need to be mutually
exclusive):

\- Define one or more RedCap specific Access Identities. Access
Identities are connected to the UE type and are (currently) used to lift
the barring for certain identities, e.g. for special access classes or
UEs configured for prioritized services.

\- Define RedCap specific Access Categories. Access Categories are
related to the type of access attempt and is set per access attempt type
depending on what triggered the access (set by NAS if NAS triggered, or
by RRC if AS triggered). There can only be one Access Category per
access attempt. To be able to treat different RedCap access attempt
types differently, e.g. apply different barring to different access
types, multiple Access Categories for RedCap could be defined.

\- Use some of the operator defined Access Categories for RedCap. The
description of the previous solution applies also to this solution, the
difference is that this solution has no specification impact but cannot
be used for initial attach to the network since it depends to CN
configuration of the UE.

\- Broadcast a different set of UAC parameters for RedCap UEs. This
makes it possible for NW to flexibly and separately provide UAC
parameters for RedCap UEs while avoiding impact on UAC configuration of
non-RedCap UEs.

\- Use existing broadcasted UAC parameters for RedCap UEs with no
changes, that is, the same UAC parameters apply for all UEs (non-RedCap
UEs and RedCap UEs) and no new Access Categories and Access Identities
are defined. This option requires no specification changes.

UAC is defined in TS 22.261 and TS 24.501, and feasibility of the
options (e.g. defining new Access Identities or Access Categories)
should be consulted with SA1/CT1.

### 11.2.4 RRC connection reject

To save radio resources and limit negative impact on legacy network
performance it is beneficial to bar or reject UEs as early as possible,
preferably without additional signalling. Therefore, cell barring and
UAC is beneficial compared to RRC connection rejection. However, if the
network is aware of the UEs type during initial access, it is possible
for the network to reject RRC connection based on the UE type. There is
no additional specification impact in case early indication is
specified.

### 11.2.5 Analysis of coexistence with legacy UEs

The purpose of the RedCap access restrictions is to eliminate or limit
the impact on legacy UEs. The impact for enabling any of above features
is an increase is in OH due to added parameters in SI broadcast
signalling.

One possibility is that separate RACH configuration is provided for
RedCap UEs. In such case, it would be possible to configure different
RACH parameters to RedCap and non-RedCap UEs, such as different maximum
number for preamble transmission, different back-off timer after an
attempt or a different power ramping step for RedCap UEs.

### 11.2.6 Analysis of specification impacts

Cell barring would have small impact on RAN2 specification if explicit
indication is used, and if a separate *intraFreqReselection* parameter
is introduced for RedCap. With an implicit indication e.g. implicit from
the presence of RedCap configuration in SI, there would be no additional
specification impact from cell barring.

For UAC, using operator defined Access Categories for RedCap would not
have any specification impact. Introducing new Access Categories or
Access Identity for RedCap would have SA1 and CT1 specification impact.
Introducing a separate configuration for RedCap UE would increase the
amount of broadcast system information.

Supporting RRC connection reject would have no specification impact.

12 Impact to network capacity and spectral efficiency
=====================================================

The system-level simulation (SLS) evaluations for the impacts of UE
complexity reduction and antenna inefficiency to network capacity and
spectrum efficiency \[3\] are summarized in Table D-1 to D-25 in Annex
D. The methodology for the SLS evaluations is described in clause 6.4.
Burst traffic model and optional full buffer traffic are considered.

The impact from potential coverage recovery techniques is reflected in
some of the SLS results in the sense that we allow the PDSCH/PUSCH
spectral efficiency to go lower due to, e.g. repetitions and/or HARQ
transmissions (i.e. trading data rate for coverage).

For burst traffic evaluation, FTP model 3 is assumed for eMBB users. The
assumption of traffic model for RedCap users varies across the sourcing
companies. The instant message (IM) traffic model which in average
generates an offered load of 400 kbps (0.1 MB payload every 2 s) is
assumed for RedCap users by some sourcing companies. Compared to the
assumed traffic model for the eMBB users which have an offered load of
20 Mbps (0.5 MB payload every 200 ms), the RedCap users will produce a
very low data volume even with a 50-50 split of eMBB and RedCap users.
The use of IM traffic for downlink capacity evaluation corresponds to
video surveillance and industrial wireless sensor use cases for which
traffic pattern is dominated by UL transmissions. In addition, the IM
traffic may also be possible for some low data rate wearable use cases.

Some companies have considered to reuse the same FTP model 3 for RedCap
users by assuming wearable use cases have DL heavy traffic and the
traffic pattern is the same for RedCap users and eMBB users. It should
be noted that among the companies assuming FTP3 traffic model for
RedCap, there may be differences in the average traffic volume
assumption. Such a difference may contribute to different conclusion.

For burst traffic evaluation with IM traffic model for RedCap users:

\- 3 sources (Ericsson, Vivo, Qualcomm) observed that the RedCap users
have minor or no impact on spectral efficiency and capacity, and little
impact to the performance of co-existing eMBB users in the system

\- It is further noted that the 1 Rx RedCap users do not make an
appreciable change on the user throughput performance of the eMBB users
compared to the 2 Rx RedCap users

For burst traffic evaluation with FTP model 3 for RedCap users:

\- One source (Nokia) with the respective simulation assumptions
including the schedulable bandwidth reported the user throughput
performance of the eMBB users is not degraded with the presence of the
RedCap users in the system.

\- One source (Huawei/HiSilicon) with the respective simulation
assumptions including the schedulable bandwidth reported the impact on
spectral efficiency will be substantial. It is further observed
substantial cell spectral efficiency loss about 30% due to UE Rx antenna
reduced from four to two and DL modulation order restriction from 256QAM
to 64QAM in FR1 and about 50% spectral efficiency reduction due to UE Rx
antenna reduced from four to one and DL modulation order restriction
from 256QAM to 64QAM in FR1.

For optional full buffer traffic evaluation:

\- One source (Nokia) with the respective simulation assumptions
including the schedulable bandwidth reported a minor degradation of the
spectral efficiency for the eMBB users and the degree of spectral
efficiency loss is irrespective of the number of Rx antennas for RedCap
users.

\- One source (Huawei/HiSilicon) with the respective simulation
assumptions including the schedulable bandwidth reported the impact on
spectral efficiency will be substantial. It is further observed
substantial cell spectral efficiency loss about 54% due to UE Rx antenna
reduced from four to two and DL modulation order restriction from 256QAM
to 64QAM in FR1 and about 70% spectral efficiency reduction due to UE Rx
antenna reduced from four to one and DL modulation order restriction
from 256QAM to 64QAM in FR1.

13 Conclusions and recommendations
==================================

UE complexity reduction techniques have been analysed individually in
clauses 7.2 through 7.7 as well as in different combinations in clause
7.8 (cost/complexity), clause 9 (coverage recovery), and clause 12
(impact on network capacity and spectral efficiency). The main
observations from the coverage recovery evaluations are summarized in
clause 9.1.5.

Based on the analysis of the UE complexity reduction techniques, the
following is recommended for a RedCap UE.

\- Maximum UE bandwidth:

\- Maximum bandwidth of an FR1 RedCap UE during and after initial access
is 20 MHz

\- Whether an FR1 RedCap UE can optionally support a maximum bandwidth
larger than 20 MHz after initial access can be discussed during the WI
phase or at RAN plenary.

\- Maximum bandwidth of an FR2 RedCap UE during and after initial access
is 100 MHz

\- Number of Rx branches:

\- For FR1 FDD or FR2 bands where a non-RedCap UE is required to be
equipped with a minimum of 2 Rx branches, the minimum number of Rx
branches supported by specification for a RedCap UE is 1. The
specification also supports of 2 Rx branches for a RedCap UE.

\- For FR1 TDD bands where a non-RedCap UE is required to be equipped
with a minimum of 4 Rx branches, the minimum number of Rx branches
supported by specification for a RedCap UE is *N*, where *N* is to be
down-selected during the WI phase or at RAN plenary between the
following alternatives:

\- Alt 1: *N*=2

\- Alt 2: *N*=1, where *N*=2 is also supported

\- Number of DL MIMO layers:

\- For a RedCap UE with 1 Rx branch, the maximum number of DL MIMO
layers is 1.

\- For a RedCap UE with 2 Rx branches, the maximum number of DL MIMO
layers is *M*, where *M* is to be down-selected during the WI phase or
at RAN plenary between the following options (where different options
may be selected for FR1 FDD, FR1 TDD, and FR2, respectively):

\- Option 1: *M*=1, where *M*=2 is also supported

\- Option 2: *M*=2

\- Half-duplex FDD operation:

\- HD-FDD operation type B is not supported for RedCap FR1 FDD UEs in
Rel-17.

\- Decide at RAN plenary whether to have support FD-FDD or HD-FDD
operation type A or both by specification for an FR1 FDD RedCap UE.

\- Relaxed UE processing time:

\- Decide at RAN plenary whether to support relaxed UE processing time
in terms of N~1~ and N~2~ by specification for a RedCap UE.

\- Relaxed maximum modulation order:

\- Support of 256QAM in DL is optional (instead of mandatory) for an FR1
RedCap UE.

\- No other relaxations of maximum modulation order are supported by
specification for a RedCap UE.

The study of UE power saving through reduced PDCCH monitoring can be
summarized as follows:

\- The PDCCH monitoring reduction for RedCap UEs has been studied. The
study includes the evaluation of power saving benefit, system
performance impacts, coexistence impacts, potential schemes, and the
corresponding specification impacts.

\- The power saving benefit by PDCCH monitoring reduction for RedCap UEs
has been evaluated based on the agreed power model and traffic model,
with the results and observations captured in clause 8.2.2.

\- The system performance impact has been evaluated using PDCCH blocking
rate as the metric, with the results and observations captured in clause
8.2.3. In addition, scheduling flexibility and latency impacts have also
been studied in clause 8.2.3.

\- Three candidate schemes for PDCCH monitoring reduction have been
identified and studied with the corresponding coexistence and
specification impacts captured in clause 8.2.4 and clause 8.2.5,
respectively.

The study of UE power saving on extended DRX in RRC\_INACTIVE and/or
RRC\_IDLE can be summarized as follows:

\- Extended DRX for RedCap UEs for RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE have been
studied. The study includes analysis of UE power saving, possible upper
and lower bounds for eDRX cycles and study of possible mechanisms for
eDRX for RedCap UEs in clauses 8.3.1-8.3.4.

\- The upper bound for DRX cycles and shorter eDRX values than 5.12
seconds, i.e. 2.56 seconds have been studied and options are discussed
in clause 8.3.3.

\- Solutions for PTW and eDRX cycle configuration and which node should
configure the eDRX cycle for RRC\_INACTIVE have been studied and
solutions are captured in clause 8.3.4.

Based on the study of UE power saving on extended DRX, the following are
recommended from RAN2 perspective, where feasibility is to be confirmed
with SA2 and/or CT1:

\- The applicable parts of eDRX mechanisms for LTE, including use of
H-SFN, PH and PTW are expected to be re-used for RedCap UEs.

\- It is recommended that for eDRX cycles below and equal to 10.24
seconds PTW and PH is not used and that common design for handling eDRX
cycle equal to 10.24 seconds in RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE is
specified.

\- It is recommended eDRX cycles in RRC\_IDLE are extended up to
10485.76 seconds, unless RAN4 indicates such eDRX value requires UE to
perform RRM on serving cell outside PTW.

\- It is recommended eDRX cycles in RRC\_INACTIVE are extended \> 10.24
seconds.

The study of UE power saving on RRM relaxation for stationary UEs can be
summarized as follows:

\- RRM relaxation for RedCap UEs has been studied. The study includes
the definition of the possible RRM relaxation triggers and the candidate
RRM relaxation methods for stationary UEs in clauses 8.4.2 and 8.4.3.

\- It is recommended that enabling or disabling RRM relaxation should be
under network\'s control.

\- RAN4 should be consulted on feasibility of any RRM relaxation methods
which are to be defined.

\- RRM relaxation has been studied for all the RRC states (RRC\_IDLE,
RRC\_INACTIVE and RRC\_CONNECTED) and both for neighbour cell and for
serving cell measurements.

\- For RRC\_CONNECTED, it is recommended that UEs which are fixed or
immobile are considered with higher priority compared to UEs which are
slightly moving.

\- Irrespective of RRC state, serving cell RRM relaxation for RedCap UEs
is not recommended to be specified.

The study of reduced capability signaling framework can be summarized as
follows:

\- The studied alternatives and options for RedCap UE type definition
and categorization of RedCap capabilities are captured in clause 10.1.
Down-selection can be discussed further during WI phase.

\- At least for device type identification and possibly for constraining
the use of reduced capabilities, the network needs to know whether the
UE is RedCap UE or not.

\- As a baseline, the existing UE capability framework is used to
indicate the capabilities of RedCap UEs.

\- The capabilities for RedCap UEs can be categorized as mandatory
capabilities, which all RedCap UEs support, and possible optional
capabilities, signaled explicitly.

\- The final categorization of capabilities into the studied categories
depends on the exact capabilities applicable to RedCap UEs, to be
defined during the WI phase.

\- The network should be able to control that the RedCap UEs are only
used for the intended use cases, the studied solutions are listed in
clause 10.2.

The study of identification and access restriction can be summarized as
follows:

\- RedCap early indication in Msg1, Msg3, MsgA, or in a later message
have been studied and analysis is presented in clause 11.1.1. The
necessity of early indication depends on the need for the network to
know whether the UE accessing the system is a RedCap UE during the
initial access, e.g. depending on the need of coverage recovery,
different scheduling of RedCap UEs, or additional access restrictions.

\- Different mechanisms for access control of RedCap UEs in RAN have
been studied and analysis is presented in clause 11.2.

\- System information indication has been studied in clause 11.2.2. It
is recommended to specify a system information indication to indicate
whether a RedCap UE can camp on the cell or not.

\- Unified access control is studied in clause 11.2.3. UAC should apply
to RedCap UEs and one option is that UAC can differentiate between
RedCap and non-RedCap UEs. Different solutions for RedCap UAC have been
studied and down-selection can be done in WI phase.

\- It is possible to use RRC connection reject (clause 11.2.4) if the
network knows the UE is a RedCap UE, however, preferably access control
should happen earlier.

######### Annex C: Link budget evaluation results

C.1 Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz
=============================

Link budget evaluation results for the Urban scenario at 2.6 GHz from
all the sourcing companies are captured in Tables C.1-1, C.1-2, C.1-3,
and C.1-4. Tables C.1-1, C.1-2, and C.1-3 show the MIL results for
reference NR UEs with 4 Rx branches (100MHz bandwidth), RedCap UEs with
2 Rx branches (20MHz bandwidth), and RedCap UEs with 1 Rx branch (20MHz
bandwidth), respectively. For every sourcing-company result, the values
of the target MIL and the amount of compensation for each channel that
has MIL below the target value are highlighted.

Additionally, the MPL results are provided Table C.1-4. The detailed
link budget calculations from the sourcing companies can be found in
\[3\].

C.2 Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz
=============================

Link budget evaluation results for the Rural scenario at 0.7 GHz from
all the sourcing companies are captured in Tables C.2-1, C.2-2, C.2-3,
and C.2-4. Tables C.2-1, C.2-2, and C.2-3 show the MIL results for
reference NR UEs with 2 Rx branches (100MHz bandwidth), RedCap UEs with
2 Rx branches (20MHz bandwidth), and RedCap UEs with 1 Rx branch (20MHz
bandwidth), respectively. For every sourcing-company result, the values
of the target MIL and the amount of compensation for each channel that
has MIL below the target value are highlighted.

Additionally, the MPL results are provided Table C.2-4. The detailed
link budget calculations from the sourcing companies can be found in
\[3\].

C.3 Urban scenario at 4 GHz
===========================

Link budget evaluation results for the Urban scenario at 4 GHz from all
the sourcing companies are captured in Tables C.3-1, C.3-2, C.3-3, and
C.3-4. Tables C.3-1, C.3-2, and C.3-3 show the MIL results for reference
NR UEs with 4 Rx branches (100MHz bandwidth), RedCap UEs with 2 Rx
branches (20MHz bandwidth), and RedCap UEs with 1 Rx branch (20MHz
bandwidth), respectively. For every sourcing-company result, the values
of the target MIL and the amount of compensation for each channel that
has MIL below the target value are highlighted.

Additionally, the MPL results are provided Table C.3-4. The detailed
link budget calculations from the sourcing companies can be found in
\[3\].

C.4 Indoor scenario at 28 GHz
=============================

Link budget evaluation results for the Indoor scenario at 28 GHz from
all the sourcing companies are captured in Tables C.4-1, C.4-2, C.4-3,
C.4-4, and C.4-5. Tables C.4-1, C.4-2, C.4-3, and C.4-4 show the MIL
results for reference NR UEs with 2 Rx branches (100MHz bandwidth),
RedCap UEs with 1 Rx branch (100MHz bandwidth), RedCap UEs with 2 Rx
branches (50MHz bandwidth), and RedCap UEs with 1 Rx branch (50MHz
bandwidth), respectively. For every sourcing-company result, the values
of the target MIL and the amount of compensation for each channel that
has MIL below the target value are highlighted.

Additionally, the MPL results are provided Table C.4-5. The detailed
link budget calculations from the sourcing companies can be found in
\[3\].

######### Annex D: System-level simulation evaluation results

Based on the latest available evaluation results in \[3\], the
system-level simulation (SLS) evaluations of the impact of complexity
reduction and antenna inefficiency to network capacity are summarized in
Table D-1 to D-25. Table D-1 lists additional evaluation assumptions for
capacity and spectral efficiency evaluation. Results for burst traffic
are summarized in Table D-2 -- Table D-19, for various deployment
scenarios (Urban at 2.6 GHz, Urban at 4 GHz, and Indoor at 28 GHz),
various loads (low and medium), and various RedCap UE complexity
reduction options (2 Rx branches and 1 Rx branch). Both downlink and
uplink results are summarized. Additionally, results for full-buffer
traffic are summarized in Table D-22 -- Table D-25.

E.1 Extended DRX for RRC Inactive and/or Idle
=============================================

E.1.1 Power saving evaluation in \[8\]
--------------------------------------

In order to evaluate the additional power savings that could be achieved
by introducing eDRX in NR compared to legacy I-DRX, we use a model based
on TR 38.840, scaled to 20MHz for Idle mode operation. We consider two
scenarios: 1) High SINR, and 2) Low SINR, as illustrated below:

Figure E.1.1-1: Timeline for I-DRX with high SINR

Figure E.1.1-2: Timeline for I-DRX with high SINR

Relative power during various states can be modelled as below:

(\*) The value depends on the power saving scenario adopted

We also define the following energy consumption for the state
transition.

  **Component Description**   **Energy notation**   **Energy**   **Occurrence notation**
  --------------------------- --------------------- ------------ -------------------------
  Micro sleep transition      $$E_{M\text{ST}}$$    0            $$N_{\text{MST}}$$
  Light sleep transition      $$E_{\text{LST}}$$    100          $$N_{\text{LST}}$$
  Deep sleep transition       $$E_{\text{DST}}$$    450          $$N_{\text{DST}}$$

Based on the above timeline and power model, the power consumption for
I-DRX with high SINR is given by:

$$P_{IDRX,\ High\ SINR} = \frac{P_{\text{SSB}} \times T_{\text{SSB}} + P_{\text{PO}} \times T_{\text{PO}} + P_{\text{DS}} \times (T_{\text{IDRX}} - T_{\text{SSB}} - T_{\text{PO}}) + E_{\text{DST}} \times N_{\text{DST}}}{T_{\text{IDRX}}}\ $$

For low SINR, it is given by:

$$P_{IDRX,\ \ Low\ SINR} = \frac{\begin{matrix}
P_{\text{SSB}} \times T_{\text{SSB}} + {P_{\text{IntraF}} \times T_{\text{IntraF}} + P}_{\text{PO}} \times T_{\text{PO}} + P_{\text{InterF}} \times T_{\text{InterF}} + P_{\text{LS}} \times T_{\text{LS}} \\
 + E_{\text{LST}} \times N_{\text{LST}} + P_{\text{DS}} \times \left( T_{\text{IDRX}} - T_{\text{SSB}} - T_{\text{IntraF}} - T_{\text{PO}} - T_{\text{InterF}} - T_{\text{LS}} \right) + E_{\text{DST}} \times N_{\text{DST}} \\
\end{matrix}}{T_{\text{IDRX}}}$$

For eDRX, if we consider the UE to be in deep sleep outside of PTW and
consuming power P~IDRX~ (in the formula above) during PTW, the formula
for eDRX power consumption becomes:

$$P_{\text{eDRX}} = \frac{P_{\text{IDRX}} \times L_{\text{PTW}} + P_{\text{DS}} \times (T_{\text{eDRX}} - L_{\text{PTW}})}{T_{\text{eDRX}}}$$

Where, L~PTW~ is the PTW length.

Some example power savings by introducing eDRX, with different
eDRX/I-DRX configurations are summarised in the table below:

Table E.1.1-2: Example power savings that can be achieved with eDRX

  **Scenario**   **T~I-DRX~ (ms)**   **T~eDRX~ (ms)**   **PTW length (ms)**   **% Savings with eDRX compared to I-DRX**

  High SINR      1280                10,485,760         1280                  50.56
  High SINR      320                 10,485,760         320                   80.36
  Low SINR       2560                10,485,760         2560                  56.08
  Low SINR       1280                10,485,760         1280                  71.86
  Low SINR       320                 10,485,760         320                   91.08

From the evaluation above, it is clear that eDRX brings significant
improvements to power consumption, and it is also clear that eDRX
concepts and mechanisms such as PTW and extension of paging cycles to
hyper-frames that were introduced for LTE/NB-IoT should be re-used in
RedCap.

E.1.2 Power saving evaluation in \[9\]
--------------------------------------

**Assumptions**

To evaluate the power saving functionality for RedCap, we used
assumptions based on the agreements made in RAN1 WG1 meeting\#101e and
\#102e, see SID status report in RP-201676. We considered the power
saving model described in TR 38.840 clause 8. We considered 20 MHz
bandwidth in FR1. We assumed half-duplex RedCap devices that have 1 TX
and 2 RX antennas with one MIMO layer in UL where MCS 0 is considered
for MSG3 and MSG4. We assumed that the RedCap device is powered with 2
AA batteries (capacity is about 2x2000mAh depending on size current
discharge) where self-discharging is negligible. It is assumed that the
PDCCH monitoring periodicity is 1 ms. No power consumption due to RRM
measurements was considered in the evaluation. Also, no coverage
recovery is considered in the evaluation. We assumed the SSB
synchronization time, i.e. if the sleep between two wakeup periods is
extensively long, so there should be some power consumption accounted
for to synchronize. We have taken an optimistic approach in determining
the SSB period, MIB and SIB acquisition times, and average
synchronization time, assuming the power consumption defined in 8.1.1
and 8.1.3 of TR 38.840 for SSB based synchronization tracking. We
considered the packet inter-arrival time to model data traffic
generation. In addition to the IAT specified in RP-201676, we have also
evaluated battery lifetime for a number of IATs. The Inter-arrival rate
is considered for uplink traffic.

**Results**

The evaluation results are shown in figure E.1.2-1. Figure E.1.2-1 shows
the battery lifetime gain for different eDRX cycles and different
inter-arrival times. The inter-arrival time in this figure is
represented in the order of minutes. If one looks at the inter-arrival
time of 1 min, when the eDRX cycle goes beyond 64 min, further extension
of the eDRX cycle lengths does not significantly increase the lifetime.
It is worth to note that the length of the eDRX cycle extension gain
largely depends on the packet inter-arrival time. The IAT above 300
minutes also has nominal battery lifetime gain. Looking at the result,
regardless of the payload\'s inter-arrival time, one can see that with a
DRX cycle up to 10.24s a battery lifetime of around 6 to 8 months can be
achieved for a device in RRC\_IDLE. With an eDRX cycle above 10.24s,
RRC\_INACTIVE has 25% higher gain than the RRC\_IDLE state due to the
reduced signalling load between gNB and UE. It is worth to note that the
presented power saving gains may be optimistic due to the simplistic
assumptions made during the evaluation.

Figure E.1.2-1: RedCap UE battery lifetime in RRC\_INACTIVE and
RRC\_IDLE state.

In the SID use case with Industrial Wireless Sensor Network (IWSN), the
UE battery is expected to last at least a few years. From our result,
one can see that eDRX longer than 10.24s is required to have a UE
battery life of \"at least a few years\" for both RRC\_IDLE and
RRC\_INACTIVE cases. Based on the results, we recommend RAN2 to extend
the eDRX cycle for both RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE beyond 10.24
seconds.

**Analysis**

**Length of extension for eDRX in RRC\_IDLE**

From the results we can see that it is reasonable to extend the eDRX
duty cycle to 64 minutes (1.06 hours). In LTE a 10-bit H-SFN is defined
in SI for eDRX. If we adopt the LTE-MTC mechanism for NR then the H-SFN
signalling in SIB1 limits the eDRX cycle length to 10845.76 seconds or
2.91 hours, see table E.1.2-1.

Following agreement was made in RAN2\#111-e,

*For RRC\_IDLE and/or RRC\_INACTIVE, if the NR DRX cycle range is
extended beyond 10.24s, the LTE ‎eDRX mechanism beyond 10.24s (e.g.,
PTW, PH, etc.) is used as baseline when NR eDRX cycle is configured
beyond 10.24s.*

Table E.1.2-1: SFN and H-SFN bit mapping

+-------+---------+------------------------+-----------------+
| Name  | Range   | Synchronization Method | Max Time in sec |
+=======+=========+========================+=================+
| SFN   | 0\~1023 | MIB(PBCH)r             | 10.24           |
+-------+---------+------------------------+-----------------+
| H-SFN | 0\~1023 | SIB1                   | 10485.76        |
|       |         |                        |                 |
|       |         |                        | (=2.91 hour)    |
+-------+---------+------------------------+-----------------+

Hence, it is likely to introduce 10 H-SFN bits for NR RedCap as well. In
this case, even if the exact use cases would be fine with eDRX extension
up to 64 minutes. Unless there is a good technical reason, we should not
limit the configuration possibility.

**Length of extension for eDRX in RRC\_INACTIVE**

During the state transition RRC\_INACTIVE state can reduce control
signalling by 57%\~63% compared to RRC\_IDLE. In case the state
transition occurs in a new gNB with in an assigned paging area then
there is \~88% lower signalling cost with RRC\_INACTIVE compared to
RRC\_IDLE (Hailu, Sofonias, Mikko Saily, and Olav Tirkkonen. \"RRC State
handling for 5G.\" IEEE Communications Magazine 57.1 (2018): 106-113).
On top of that introducing eDRX in RRC\_INACTIVE state can be very
effective from battery lifetime perspective. As currently specified,
RRC\_INACTIVE with short DRX cycle cannot be considered as a good state
if the UE wants to save power e.g., for some RedCap use cases such as
IWSN. Moreover, the eDRX cycle length extension for RRC\_INACTIVE beyond
10.24s may bring value for other WIs such as Small data enhancement and
future WIs like LPWAN in NR. Hence, we should support the extension of
the DRX cycle for RRC\_INACTIVE mode.

Table E.1.2-2 illustrates the battery life gain in RRC\_IDLE and
RRC\_INACTIVE state, with 2 mins eDRX cycle compared to 10.24s eDRX, for
the RedCap SID defined used cases and agreed traffic model in RP-201676.
As shown in the table the battery life gain for eDRX above 10.24s in
RRC\_INACTIVE shows significant gain compared to RRC\_INACTIVE with same
eDRX cycle. For instance, in IWSN case, if we increase the IAT to 1 min
up to 65% battery lifetime gain is possible in RRC\_INACTIVE in
comparison of RRC\_IDLE with eDRX beyond 10.24s. Additionally, please
note that IAT increment to 5 min also shows significantly better battery
life gain in RRC\_INACTIVE compared to RRC\_IDLE.

E.2 RRM relaxation for stationary devices
=========================================

E.2.1 RRM relaxation evaluation in \[9\]
----------------------------------------

Figure E.2.1-1 shows how the average device power consumption is reduced
with increased interval between RRM measurements on neighbour cells. The
power calculation is performed with the model in TR 38.840. At some
point in time the effect of further Increase of the interval between
measurements is insignificant. The red dashed line in Figure E.2.1-1 at
one hour represents the condition where a device, which is not at cell
edge and low mobility, may skip measurements for an hour. Note that even
before an interval of one hour) the power consumption has almost reached
its minimum. It is likely that the shape of the curve is not affected by
UE\'s RRC state, however, the Rel-16 functionality mentioned only refers
to a device in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE.

E.2.2 RRM relaxation in idle/inactive mode for serving cell in \[10\]
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Simulation cases:**

To evaluate the power saving gain of serving cell RRM relaxation for
RedCap UEs in idle and inactive mode, the following 6 cases are modeled
and evaluated, which are classified as three scenarios: Rel-15/Rel-16
paging monitoring mechanism, WUS is applied for paging monitoring,
including with or without gap between WUS and SSB.

Note: The intention to consider WUS together here is to provide the
power saving gain in different scenarios (e.g. with or without WUS). As
WUS in idle mode may be introduced in Rel-17 power saving, the following
simulation results the power saving gain for RRM relaxation for use
cases with and without WUS, which shows that there is still power saving
gain even in the case with WUS.

Note 1: No neighbour cell RRM relaxation is performed in this
simulation.

Note 2: FFS on whether WUS is applicable to Redcap devices.

**- Scenario 1**: When Rel-15/Rel-16 paging monitoring mechanism is
adopted:

**- Case1**: No relaxation on serving cell RRM is applied, i.e. UE needs
to measure one SSB and monitor one Paging Occasion (PO) per DRX cycle as
legacy.

**- Case2**: RRM relaxation with 4x on serving cell, i.e. UE needs to
measure one SSB every four DRX cycles and monitor one PO per DRX cycle.
As a result, power consumption can be saved by skipping the monitoring
of 75% SSBs and long deep sleep duration per DRX cycle can be achieved.

**- Scenario 2**: WUS is applied for paging monitoring, PO monitoring is
only required when WUS is received, which occurs with low probability.
It is assumed there is no time interval between WUS and SSB.

**- Case3:** No relaxation on serving cell RRM is applied, i.e. UE needs
to measure one SSB and monitor one WUS per DRX cycle.

**- Case4:** RRM relaxation with 4x on serving cell**,** i.e. UE needs
to measure one SSB every four DRX cycles and monitor one WUS per DRX
cycle.

**- Scenario 3**: WUS is applied for paging monitoring, PO monitoring is
only required when WUS is received, which occurs with low probability.
The time interval between WUS and SSB is assumed as 3ms and micro sleep
is performed between WUS and SSB.

**- Case5: No s**elaxation on serving cell RRM is applied, i.e. UE needs
to measure one SSB and monitor one WUS per DRX cycle.

**- Case6: 4** RRM relaxation with 4x on serving cell**,** i.e. UE needs
to measure one SSB every four DRX cycles and monitor one WUS per DRX
cycle.

**Simulation Assumptions:**

\- The paging rate is 10%, referring to that 10% POs indicating UE to
receive paging PDSCH.

\- The time interval between a SSB and its relative PO is 10ms.

\- 𝑃~WUS~= 𝑃~PO~ = 𝑃~SSB~ =50 power units/slot, where 𝑃~WUS~ , 𝑃~PO~ and
𝑃~SSB~ represent the power consumpation for each WUS, PO and SSB
reception respectively. The power consumpation is scaled to a 20MHz
receiving bandwidth from the 100MHz power model in TR 38.840.

*- T*~WUS~= *T*~SSB~ = 2ms, where *T*~WUS~ and *T*~SSB~ denote the
duration of WUS and SSB.

\- UEs are assumed as \"true\" stationary.

\- More detailed power consumption model could be found in TR 38.840.

Most of the gain are achieved by skipping SSB measurement with RRM
relaxation. In addition, skipping SSB measurement extends the time
interval between adjacent wake-up, leading to more energy efficient
sleep, e.g. using one long deep sleep to replace serval micro sleeps.

**3.6%\~13.4% power saving gain is observed when 4 times RRM relaxation
for serving cell is adopted by high SINR for idle/inactive UE.**

Note: The impact on PDCCH and PDSCH decoding as a results of not
monitoring SSBs are not captured in this simulation.

E.2.3 RRM relaxation in connected mode in \[10\]

RRC\_Connected UEs is required to derive one L3 sample per 200ms at the
maximum. Such frequent measurement may not be always necessary for
stationary or low mobility RedCap UEs, e.g. some fixed industry sensors.
In addition, UE is required to perform measurement on too many
inter-frequency layers and cells per frequency layers. Related RRM
relaxation enhancements has been evaluated in Rel-16 and the results
come from Power saving SI TR \[6\]:

\- By increasing measurement period 4 times for RRC\_Connected UEs,
11.1% - 26.6% power saving gains are observed, at the cost of an
increase of handover failure rate from 0% to 0.26% for stationary or low
mobility (e.g., 3km/h) case.

\- By reducing the number of measured cells for RRC\_Connected UEs, 1.8%
- 21.3% power saving gain can be observed. In addition, 26.43% - 37.5%
power saving gain is shown by assuming that UE can limit the processing
for measurement within a constrained time period and/or with reduced
complexity.

\- By reducing the number of measured inter-frequency layers can provide
21%\~38% power saving gain for RRC\_Connected UEs.

E.2.4 RRM relaxation evaluation in \[11\]

The following table shows the average power consumption and power saving
gain when further expand the measurement interval from using three times
scaling factor to stopping measurement for 1 hour. The power calculation
is performed with the model in TR 38.840. For DRX cycle =1280ms, power
saving gain of 25.17% can be achieved.

The measurement time reduction is further illustrated in Figure E.2.x-2
by reducing the measurement time duration discussed above, with the
typical SMTC window with length 5ms (i.e. half frame) and periodicity
20ms. We assume that the maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame
equals to 8, so the average time duration for detecting/measuring one
SSB is 0.625ms. The time reduction and power saving gain are given in
the Table E.2.x-3 as below. Moreover, the power saving gain can be
obtained with few performance degrading since only unnecessary SSBs
detection/measurement are avoided.

The following table shows the average power consumption and power saving
gain when further expand the measurement interval from using three times
scaling factor to stopping measurement for 1 hour. The power calculation
is performed with the model in TR 38.840. For DRX cycle =1280ms, power
saving gain of 25.17% can be achieved. Therefore, it is proposed to
further enhance RRM measurement relaxation by expanding the scenario of
performing \"stop measurement for 1 hour\" for stationary UEs.
