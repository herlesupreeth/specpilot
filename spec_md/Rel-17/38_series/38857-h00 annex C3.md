##### C.3.1.1.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

1-symbol PRS with comb-4 and comb-12 is evaluated compared to 4-symbol
and 12-symbol, respectively, assuming

\- PRS transmission periodicity is 160ms

\- PRS numerology is 30kHz

\- 8 PRS resources with 12 symbols or 4 symbols per PRS resource

\- The PRS bandwidth is 100MHz

In addition, E-CID is also compared against PRS-based methods.

##### C.3.1.1.2 Network efficiency analysis of NR positioning enhancements 

The evaluation results are summarized in Table C.3.1.1.2-1.

Table C.3.1.1.2-1: NR positioning enhancements -- network efficiency
summary \[4\]

  Case                           Positioning resource utilization
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------
  Case E1: PRS with 12 symbols   2.14%
  Case E2: PRS with 4 symbols    0.714%
  Case E3: PRS with 1 symbol     0.179%
  Case E4: E-CID enhancement     0%

By reducing the PRS symbols from 12 and 4 to 1 for comb-12 and comb-4,
respectively, the overhead of PRS transmission is reduced by 11/12 and
3/4, respectively.

##### C.3.1.2.2 Network efficiency analysis of NR positioning enhancements 

For the proposed NR positioning enhancements, we use DL-TDOA+DL-CPP or
UL-TDOA+UL-CPP as the Rel.17 enhancement scheme. Carrier Phase
Positioning can be supported by using Rel.16 DL-PRS or UL-SRS, i.e., the
UE or gNB can get the carrier phase measurements together with other NR
positioning measurements without additional RF resources and new
reference signals. Therefore, the network efficiency of our proposed NR
positioning enhancements is the same as that of Rel.16 positioning
solutions.

The definition of DL-PRS/UL-SRS resource utilization and the calculation
of DL-PRS/UL-SRS resource utilization according to the described
definition are shown as in below.

Definition of DL-PRS resource utilization

Assume gNB x has M TRPs (the index of TRP is j, and j=1\~M-1) which are
configured to transmit DL-PRS, and each TRP is configured with N DL-PRS
resource sets (the index of DL-PRS resource set is i, i=1\~N-1). In
order to avoid the interference among these DL-PRS resource sets, either
the time-domain resources or the frequency-domain resources are
orthogonal among these DL-PRS resource sets belongs to the same gNB.

We use *DL\_PRS\_RU* to denote DL-PRS resource utilization, then the
DL-PRS resource utilization of gNB *x*
(${DL\_ PRS\_ RU}_{\text{gNB\ x}}$) can be derived as follows,

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}\  = \ {\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} \times {\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}}$$

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} = \frac{\ \text{NumOfSymbols}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}}}{\text{Periodicity}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i} \times \text{NumOfSymbols}_{\text{Per}\ \text{millisecond}}} \times \text{NumofPRSResources}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i} \times \text{RepetitionFactor}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}\ $$

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}} = \frac{\text{BandWidth}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}}{\text{BandWidth}_{\text{System}}} \times \frac{1}{\text{CombSizeN}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}}$$

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{TRP}\ j}\  = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}$$

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{gNB}\ x}\  = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{M}{\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{TRP}\ j}$$

Calculation of DL-PRS resource utilization

The calculation of DL-PRS resource utilization according to the above
described definition are shown as follows,

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} = \frac{12}{20 \times 28} \times 1 \times 1 = 2.1\%\ $$

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}} = \frac{100\text{MHz}}{100\text{MHz}} \times \frac{1}{6} = 16.7\%$$

$${DL_{\text{PR}S_{\text{RU}}}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}\  = \ {\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} \times {\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}} = 2.1\% \times 16.7\% = 0.36\%$$

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{TRP}\ j}\  = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{1}{{\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{PRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i} =}0.36\%$$

$${\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{gNB}\ x}\  = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{6}{\text{DL}\_\text{PRS}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{TRP}\ j} = 2.1\%$$

[Definition of SRS-Pos resource utilization]{.underline}

Assume gNB x serves M UEs (the index of UE is j, and j=1\~M-1) which are
configured to transmit SRS-Pos, and each UE is configured with N SRS-Pos
resource sets (the index of SRS-Pos resource set is i, i=1\~N-1). In
order to avoid the interference among these SRS-Pos resource sets,
either the time-domain resources or the frequency-domain resources are
orthogonal among these SRS-Pos resource sets belongs to the same gNB.

We use SRS\_Pos\_RU to denote SRS-Pos resource utilization, then the
SRS-Pos resource utilization of gNB x
(${SRS\_ Pos\_ RU}_{\text{gNB\ x}}$) can be derived as follows,

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}\  = \ {\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} \times {\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}}$$

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} = \frac{\ \text{NumOfSymbols}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}}}{\text{Periodicity}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i} \times \text{NumOfSymbols}_{\text{Per}\ \text{millisecond}}} \times \text{NumofSRSResources}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}\ $$

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}} = \frac{\text{BandWidth}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}}{\text{BandWidth}_{\text{System}}} \times \frac{1}{\text{CombSizeN}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}}$$

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{UE}\ j}\  = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}$$

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{gNB}\ x}\  = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{M}{\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{UE}\ j}$$

[Calculation of SRS-Pos resource utilization]{.underline}

The calculation of UL-SRS resource utilization according to the above
described definition are shown as follows,

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} = \frac{\ 12}{20 \times 28} \times 1 = 2.1\%\ $$

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}} = \frac{100MHz}{100MHz} \times \frac{1}{8} = 12.5\%$$

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i}\  = \ {\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{time} - \text{domain}} \times {\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i,\ \text{frequency} - \text{domain}} = 4.3\% \times 12.5\% = 0.5\%$$

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{UE}\ j}\  = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{1}{\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{SRS}\ \text{resource}\ \text{set}\ i} = 0.27\%$$

When there are 1 user per site,

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{gNB}\ x}\  = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{1 \times 6}{\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{UE}\ j} = 1.6\%$$

When there are 30 users per site,

$${\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{gNB}\ x}\  = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{30 \times 6}{\text{SRS}\_\text{Pos}\_\text{RU}}_{\text{UE}\ j} = 48.2\%$$

For the network efficiency based on PRS, at least the comb size, number
of symbols, TRP number, PRS periodicity, resource repetition factor,
muting pattern, numerology and beam sweeping assumptions of PRS should
be included in resource utilization. It can be represented as equation

For the network efficiency based on SRS, at least the comb size, number
of symbols, UE number, SRS periodicity, numerology and beam sweeping
assumptions of SRS should be included in resource utilization. It can be
represented as below (2)

Note: In practice, 20ms MGL is only for 160ms periodicity. So the real
PHY latency is longer than 160ms considering 20ms MGL is needed for FR2.
But in this table, the required network and UE efficiency are evaluated
assuming it meets the corresponding Physical layer Latency in the table.

*For the* PRS resource utilization of periodic PRS as below:

\- In FR1, for 20 ms DL PRS periodicity and MG periodicity, 3ms MGL, 30
kHz subcarrier spacing, comb 6 and 6 symbols per PRS resource, 18
positioning sites and 1 beams per site, PRS resource utilization is
3.21% while the MGL/MGRP (UE overhead) is 15%.

\- In FR2, for 20 ms DL PRS periodicity, 20ms for MGL and MGRP, 120 kHz
subcarrier spacing, comb 6 and 6 symbols per PRS resource, 18
positioning sites and 64 beams per site, PRS resource utilization is
51.42% while the MGL/MGRP (UE overhead) is 100%

\- In FR1, for 20 ms DL PRS periodicity and MG periodicity, 3ms MGL, 30
kHz subcarrier spacing, comb 6 and 6 symbols per PRS resource, 18
positioning sites and 1 beams per site, PRS resource utilization is
3.21% while the MGL/MGRP (UE overhead) is 15%.

\- In FR2, for 20 ms DL PRS periodicity, 20ms for MGL and MGRP, 120 kHz
subcarrier spacing, comb 6 and 6 symbols per PRS resource, 18
positioning sites and 64 beams per site, PRS resource utilization is
51.42% while the MGL/MGRP (UE overhead) is 100%

It is observed that the network efficiency exceeds 100%, or the
MGL/MGRP(UE efficiency) exceed 30% in some FR2 cases.

*While the* PRS resource utilization of on-demand PRS can determine
which repetition and TRP transmitting if assumed 16 repetitions in 160ms
for every TRP. The minimum Network and UE efficiency of on-demand PRS is
0% if no positioning requesting in 160ms or no positioning requesting
for the UE.

In addition, the network efficiency of aperiodic PRS are affected by the
number of activations within unit time (such as 160ms). It can be
observed the network efficiency of aperiodic PRS less than the Periodic
PRS with 160ms periodicity if the number of activations less than 1 and
less than the Periodic PRS with 10ms periodicity if the number of
activations less than 10. Meanwhile, the latency can be reduced by
nearly 20ms.

##### C.3.1.4.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

We consider the measurement gap as the resource overhead for DL PRS
reception. The UE can measure DL PRS resource outside the active BWP or
with a numerology different from that of the active BWP. Furthermore, as
specified in rel16 UE feature, measurement gap is necessary for a UE to
receive and process DL PRS resource. During the measurement gap, the UE
cannot receive and transmit the normal NR traffic. Thus we can consider
all the radio resource within each measurement gap are 'occupied' by the
NR positioning. The resource utilization can be calculated as:

$$\rho_{\text{PRS}} = \frac{L_{\text{MG}}}{T_{\text{MG}}}$$

Where $T_{\text{MG}}$ and $L_{\text{MG}}$ are the measurement gap
repetition period and length of measurement gap respectively.

C.3.1.4.2 Network efficiency analysis of NR positioning enhancements

As specified in rel16, the length of measurement gap can be :
1.5/3/3/5/4/5.5/6 ms and the periodicity of measurement gap can be
20/40/80/160 ms. Given that, the resource overhead for DL PRS reception
are as follows:

  measurement gap repetition period   Overhead of resource for DL PRS: 1.5/3/3.5/4/5.5/6 ms length

Network efficiency is evaluated for UL SRS resource utilization for the
following cases:

\- UL SRS resource utilization w.r.t to the cyclic shift enhancements

\- UL SRS resource utilization w.r.t to the number of OFDM symbols

\- UL SRS resource utilization w.r.t to the number of antenna ports

The number of simultaneous UEs of CS separated is chosen based on the
evaluation so that the configured with different cyclic shifts on the
same REs are detected without ambiguity.

UL SRS resource utilization w.r.t to the number of OFDM symbols:

For scenarios with low delay spread and low propagation delay difference
(e.g. indoor with low ISD) COMB=4 may be sufficient. Rel-16 does not
allow SRS for positioning with COMB=4, 1 Symbol. Alternatively a Rel-15
SRS may be supported for positioning purpose.

derive the improvement factor as
$\frac{\text{Capacity\ per\ UE}_{Rel - 16}\ }{\text{Capacity\ per\ UE}_{Rel - 17}}\ $

$Capacity\ per\ UE = \frac{\text{OFDMsymbol}s_{\text{UE}}\ }{\text{CombsizeN}}\text{.\ }$

#### C.3.2.2 Results from source \[5\]

##### C.3.2.2.1 Description of evaluation scenarios

[Model and assumptions of UE efficiency for power
consumption]{.underline}

General PRS measurements assumption

\- Frequency range: FR1 has high priority

\- Bandwidth: 100MHz/30kHz (connected state); 20MHz/30kHz (idle state)

\- Periodicity: 160ms (connected state); 1280ms (idle state)

\- RE mapping: Comb-6, 6 symbols

\- 2 resources per TRP and 2 resources per slot

\- Repetition factor=8, time gap=1

\- 1 positioning frequency layer is baseline

\- 8 TRPs per frequency layer

Slot-averaged power for single positioning frequency layer measurements

We list two tables for UE power consumption for measurement on a PRS
slot in connected state and idle state, respectively.

Table C.3.2.2.1-1: UE power consumption for PRS measurements in
connected state（100MHz）

  N: Number of TRPs for single frequency layer measurement   Synchronous case   Asynchronous case
  ---------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ -------------------
  N=8                                                        610                690
  N=4                                                        490                570

Table C.3.2.2.1-2: UE power consumption for PRS measurements in idle
state（20MHz）

  N: Number of TRPs for single frequency layer measurement   Synchronous case   Asynchronous case
  ---------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ -------------------
  N=8                                                        96                 108
  N=4                                                        76                 88

In the above tables, all above values are slot-averaged power
($P_{\text{PRS}}\ $) in FR1. The synchronous case means actual PRS
transmissions from TRPs are time-aligned, while the asynchronous case
means actual PRS transmissions from TRPs are not time-aligned. The power
values in the above tables are calculated and assumed based on the SSB
power and scaling schemes in TR38.840.

[Total power for single and multiple positioning frequency layers
measurements]{.underline}

This model can refer to the model for inter-frequency RRM measurements
in TR38.840 and make some minor changes.

A UE is expected to process one frequency layer at a time. Therefore, we
propose that, for frequency layer i, the power of PRS measurement is
represented as:

$$E_{i} = P_{\text{PRS}}*N_{\text{PRS}} + E_{MG\_ switch}$$

where

\- $E_{i}$ is total power over slots over which measurements are carried
out in frequency layer i

\- $P_{\text{PRS}}$ is the slot average power for PRS measurements in
frequency layer i

\- $N_{\text{PRS}}$ is the number of slot over which measurements are
carried out

\- $E_{MG\_ switch}$ is the power for measurement gap switching, where
$E_{MG\_ switch}$= Pt \* Tt

\- Pt is the switching power consumption

\- Assume micro sleep power for Pt which equals to 45 power unit

\- Tt is switching time (including switching on and off) for FR1 for
measurement gap switching, which equals to 1ms (0.5ms\*2)

\- If gap is not configured, gap switching power is 0

For Nf frequency layers, the total power is

$$E_{\text{Nf}} = \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{Nf} - 1}E_{i}$$

It can be simplified to the following if Ei is the same across frequency
layers (i.e. Ei = E for different frequency layers ).

$E_{\text{Nf}}$ = E\*Nf

[Power components considered for PRS measurement]{.underline}

In idle state, at least the following power components are recommended
to be considered for PRS measurement power saving evaluation.

\- Note1: for PDCCH only, no PDSCH and same-slot scheduling; this
includes time for PDCCH decoding and any micro-sleep within the slot;
for PDCCH+PDSCH, it is used when the UE decodes the PDCCH for paging and
obtains the need to decode the corresponding PDSCH

burst for serving/intra-frequency RRM measurement

\- Relative power: 50

2 - Power consumption evaluation for different PRS configurations

A - PRS measurement impacted by DRX

For PRS reception impacted by DRX configuration, we set the PRS period
to be consistent with the DRX period which is equal to 160ms (the actual
PRS period is 80ms and the DRX cycle is 160ms) as shown in Figure
C.3.2.2.2-2 (baseline), which assumes that the UE only measures PRS
during DRX active time. While for PRS reception not impacted by DRX, we
set the PRS period is 80ms and the DRX cycle is 160ms as shown in Figure
C.3.2.2.2-3, which assumes that the UE receives PRS during DRX active
time and DRX non active time.

of the two cases above.

It can be observed that,

when PRS measurement is impacted by DRX (reception 1 PRS occasion every
DRX cycle (160ms)), 34.19% power saving gain is shown, comparing with
PRS measurement regardless of DRX(reception 2 PRS occasions every DRX
cycle (160ms)) .

B -Extending PRS period

As we all know, increasing the period of PRS can reduce the power
consumption of PRS measurement. Therefore, we extend PRS period 2 times
(320ms) and 4 times (640ms). The procedure and power components analysis
of PRS measurements are shown in Figure C.3.2.2.2-4 and Table
C.3.2.2.2-4 respectively.

It can be observed that,

By extending the PRS period to 2 times(160ms to 320ms), 22.03% power
saving gain is shown ,comparing with the baseline assumption.

By extending the PRS period to 4 times(160ms to 640ms), 33.05 % power
saving gain is shown ,comparing with the baseline assumption.

C - Concentrated PRS distribution

In this subsection, we compare two PRS distribution methods, namely
concentrated PRS (baseline, as in Figure C.3.2.2.2-2) and distributed
PRS (as in Figure C.3.2.2.2-5), which is based on our power consumption
model, method and assumptions. The duration of concentrated PRS
distribution is 5ms with 4ms PRS length and 1ms MG switching time. While
for distributed PRS, we divide the concentrated PRS occasion of 4ms
(baseline) into 4 PRS occasions with 1ms, and the adjacent PRS occasions
are separated by 40ms. In this case, 4 measurement gap occasions with
2ms duration is assumed. Then we compare the power consumption
performance of the 2 cases in one DRX cycle as shown in Table
C.3.2.2.2-5.

It can be seen that

when configuring concentrated PRS measurement (1 concentrated PRS
occasion every 160ms), 18.77% power saving gain is shown, comparing with
the distributed PRS measurement (4 distributed PRS occasion every
160ms).

Concentrated PRS measurement can mainly reduce the power consumption of
deep sleep transition, which is ccounted for 69.07%ofof power saving
gain.

D - Adding PRS measurement window (PRS-MTC)

In Rel-15, SMTC has been defined. SSB-MTC is used to configure
measurement timing configurations and includes duration which is the
duration of the measurement window in which to receive SS/PBCH blocks.
When SMTC is configured, the UE is not expected to measure SSB outside
the SMTC window which reduces unnecessary power consumption. For PRS
measurement, a similar window within a constrained duration (which can
be called PRS-MTC) may be introduced in Rel-17 for UE power efficient
positioning. PRS-MTC can limit the processing for measurement within a
constrained time window as shown in Figure C.3.2.2.2-6. In this case,
the UE is only required to measure PRS of 2ms length when configuring
2ms PRS MTC window.

Figure C.3.2.2.2-6: Procedure of PRS measurements with PRS MTC (2ms) in
the DRX cycle

In this subsection, we compare power consumption between PRS measurement
with 2ms PRS-MTC window and without PRS MTC window (baseline, as in
Figure C.3.2.2.2-2). The corresponding power analysis is shown below in
Table C.3.2.2.2-6.

It can be observed that,

by adding the PRS MTC window to limit PRS measurement within 2ms (from
4ms to 2ms), 20.48% power saving gain is shown, comparing with PRS
measurement without PRS-MTC (the baseline assumption, PRS measurement
within 4ms).

by reducing the number of TRPs for PRS measurement (from 8 TRPs to 4
TRPs), 8.51% power saving gain is shown ,comparing with the baseline
assumption.

It can be observed that,

By increasing the number of frequency layers to 2 (from 1 to 2), 47.61%
power consumption gain is shown, comparing with the baseline assumption.

By increasing the number of frequency layers to 4 (from 1 to 4), 133.95%
power consumption gain is shown, comparing with the baseline assumption.

Correspondingly, if we take the case of 4 frequency layers as the
baseline, then by reducing the number of frequency layer to 2 (from 4 to
2), 36.91% power saving gain is shown; by reducing number of frequency
layer to 1 (from 4 to 1), 57.26% power saving gain is shown.

Figure C.3.2.2.2-9: Procedure of PRS measurements and report in idle
state

In this subsection, we discuss power consumption for positioning
measurement and report in idle states. For positioning report in idle
state, let's take the positioning information reported by EDT as an
example. If the UE and NG-RAN node both support EDT, the UE sends an
RRCEarlyDataRequest message to the NG-RAN node and includes a NAS
control plane service request. The NAS control plane service request
includes a positioning report message. From the perspective from
physical layer, this message is carried in Msg3. Furthermore, the UE can
receive RRCEarlyDataComplete containing positioning report completion
information which is also included in Msg4.

The average power for the components introduced by positioning report in
idle state is listed below in Table C.3.2.2.2-9.

B - Idle state measurement and connected state report

In this subsection, we discuss power consumption for positioning
measurement in idle state and report in connected state. For simplicity,
it is assumed that the only thing the UE does in the connected state is
to report positioning information. The related procedure is shown in
Figure C.3.2.2.2-10.

report in connected state

The average power for the components introduced by positioning report in
connected state and RRC state switching is listed below in Table
C.3.2.2.2-11.

It can be observed that

compared to reporting in the idle state, the power consumption of
reporting in the connected state increases 79.6%.

correspondingly, if we take the case of reporting in the connected state
as the baseline, for reporting in the idle state , 44.32% power saving
gain is shown.

C- Connected state measurement and report

In this subsection, we evaluate the case for connected states
measurement and report. In order to be comparable with the above
subsections, it is assumed that the UE still starts positioning from
idle state. Furthermore, for simplicity, some additional assumptions are
below.

\- In connected state, LPP procedures including capability transfer,
positioning assistant data transfer, some request signalings between the
UE and the LMF are ignored.

\- One shot positioning measurement and report related procedures are
considered in connected state.

\- Procedures related to measurement gap configuration are ignored.

\- Once the positioning report is completed, the RRC connection is
released.

\- Measurement and report cycle is equal to idle state (1280ms).

\- PRS bandwidth in connected state is equal to PRS bandwidth in idle
state.

\- Paging occasion power is equivalent to 'PDCCH+PDSCH', considering it
may lead to RRC state transition.

Therefore, related procedure is shown in Figure C.3.2.2.2-11.

It can be observed that

compared to reporting in the idle state, the power consumption of
reporting in the connected state increases 93.72%.

correspondingly, if we take the case of reporting in the connected state
as the baseline, for reporting in the idle state, 48.38% power saving
gain is shown.

Furthermore, considering that we make some assumptions to simplify power
consumption evaluation, such as ignoring complicated steps for LPP
procedures, aligning the bandwidth and period with idle state
measurement, it will consume more power when positioning in the
connected state in general.

[UE efficiency analysis for resource utilization]{.underline}

For Rel-16 UE efficiency, it is defined as the percentage of the MGL in
the MG periodicity considering the UE is expected to process DL PRS
within measurement gap, and the UE is not expected to conduct
reception/transmission data from/to all carriers at least for
measurement gap duration time. It can be represented as below equation
(3)

$\text{UE\ }\text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{MGL}}{\text{MG\ periodicity}} \times 100\%$
(3)

Whether the MG is suitable or not for PRS measurement will directly
affect to UE efficiency. e.g. 12ms length for PRS and 20ms length for
MG, extra MG length (e.g. 8ms) will cause the wasting of UE efficiency.
Meanwhile, the distribution of PRS also affects to UE efficiency. For
example, 20ms MG is needed even the duration of PRS symbol only 2ms but
the buffer window of PRS is 20ms because of the distributed PRS. So,
on-demand MG with concentrated PRS is beneficial for reducing UE
efficiency and the evaluation results are listed in case U1.

Furthermore, the UE efficiency only is affected by the PRS that UE needs
to measure if positioning BWP is introduced and the UE efficiency will
be improved. It can be represented as below equation (4) and the
evaluation results are listed in case U2.

$\text{UE\ }\text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{the\ duration\ }K\ \text{ms}\text{\ of\ DL\ PRS\ symbols}}{P\ \text{ms}\text{\ window\ of\ unit\ time}} \times 100\%$
