 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in 3GPP
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any,
in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Antenna connector:** connector at the conducted interface of the
*repeater type 1-C*

**Beam:** beam (of the antenna) is the main lobe of the radiation
pattern of an *antenna array*

**Beam centre direction:** direction equal to the geometric centre of
the half-power contour of the beam

**Beam direction pair:** data set consisting of the *beam centre
direction* and the related *beam peak direction*

**Beam peak direction:** direction where the maximum EIRP is found

**Beamwidth:** beam which has a half-power contour that is essentially
elliptical, the half-power beamwidths in the two pattern cuts that

4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS
38.115-1 \[7\] or TS 38.115-2 \[8\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.115-1 \[7\]
and TS 38.115-2 \[8\] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are
individually calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to
relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test
requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements,
the test tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
\[6\].

4.2 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
-------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 *RF Repeater type 1-C*

For *RF* *Repeater type 1-C*, the requirements are applied at the
repeater *antenna connector* (BS-side connector or UE-side connector)
for downlink or uplink for the configuration in normal operating
conditions.

Figure 4.2.1-1: *RF Repeater type 1-C* downlink and uplink interface

### 4.2.2 *RF Repeater type 2-O*

For *RF* *repeater type 2-O*, the radiated characteristics are defined
over the air (OTA), where the operating band specific radiated interface
is referred to as the Radiated Interface Boundary (RIB). Radiated
requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial)
characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for
each requirement.

4.3 Repeater classes
--------------------

### 4.3.1 Repeater class for downlink

The requirements in this specification apply to downlink Wide Area
repeaters, downlink Medium Range repeaters and downlink Local Area
repeaters unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios
for each class are exactly the same for repeater with and without
connectors.

For *RF Repeater type 1-C* and *type 2-O*, repeater downlink classes are
defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m or from Femto Cell scenarios.

\- Note: The requirements in this specification for LA 1-C repeaters
apply to 1-C repeaters with declared output power less than or equal to
LA rated output power limits as in table 6.2.1-1.

### 4.3.2 Repeater class for uplink

The requirements in this specification apply to uplink Wide Area
repeaters and uplink Local Area repeaters unless otherwise stated. The
associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the same for
repeater with and without connectors.

For *RF* *Repeater type 1-C* and *type 2-O*, repeater uplink classes are
defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

\- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

4.6 Requirements for contiguous and *non-contiguous spectrum*
-------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a repeater operates can either be contiguous
or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the
present specification apply for repeater configured for both contiguous
spectrum operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For repeater operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements
apply at the repeater *passband* edges. For each such requirement, it is
stated how the limits apply relative to the repeater *gap between
passbands* and the *Inter-passband gap* respectively.

4.7 Requirements for repeater capable of multi-band operation
-------------------------------------------------------------

For multi-band connector or multi-band RIB, the RF requirements in
clauses 6 and 7 apply separately to each supported operating band unless
otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly stated that
specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at multi-band
connector(s), and multi-band RIB(s) as detailed in the requirement
clause. For repeater capable of multi-band operation, various structures
in terms of combinations of different downlink and uplink
implementations (multi-band or single band) with mapping to one or more
*antenna connectors* for *repeater type 1-C* in different ways are
possible. For multi-band connector(s) the exclusions or provisions for
multi-band apply. For single-band connector(s), the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, output intermodulation, ACRR and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the repeater is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to this *antenna connector* configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable repeater are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested
separately at the *antenna connector* configured for single-band
operation, with all other *antenna connectors* terminated.

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at the *antenna connector* for *repeater type 1-C*
configuration in normal operating conditions.

Requirements apply in both DL and UL unless otherwise stated or
declared.

For the DL the *antenna connector* on the BS side is the input and the
*antenna connector* on the UE side is the output.

For the UL the *antenna connector* on the UE side is the input and the

6.2 Repeater output power
-------------------------

### 6.2.1 General

The repeater conducted output power requirement is at the *antenna
connector*.

The *rated passband output power* of the *RF* *Repeater type 1-C* shall

+-----------------------------------------------+---------------------+

### 6.2.2 Minimum requirement

The requirements shall apply with NR signals in the *passband* of the
repeater at:

The lowest input power (P~in,p,AC~) that produces the *rated passband
output power* (P~rated,p,AC)~.

Up to:

The lowest input power (P~in,p,AC~) that produces the *rated passband
output power* (P~rated,p,AC~), plus 10dB

In normal conditions, the measured output power, P~max,p,AC~ shall
remain within +2 dB and -2 dB of the *rated passband output power*
P~rated,p,AC~, declared by the manufacturer.

In extreme conditions, the measured output power, P~max,p,AC~ shall
remain within +2.5 dB and -2.5 dB of the *rated passband output power*
P~rated,p,AC~, declared by the manufacturer.

6.3 Frequency stability
-----------------------

### 6.3.1 General

Frequency stability is the ability to maintain the same frequency on the
output signal with respect to the input signal.

### 6.3.2 Minimum requirement

The frequency deviation of the output signal with respect to the input
signal shall be no more than ±0,01 PPM.

6.4 Out of band gain
--------------------

### 6.4.1 General

Out of band gain refers to the gain of the repeater outside the
*passband*.

The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in-band
signals and not to amplify signals outside of the *passband*.

In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is
less than lowest expected the coupling loss to the nearest source of
emissions.

### 6.4.2 Minimum requirement

The gain outside the *passband* shall not exceed the maximum level
specified in table 6.4.2-1 or table 6.4.2-2, where:

\- f\_offset\_CW is the offset between the outer channel edge frequency
of the outer channel in the *passband* and a CW signal.

Table 6.4.2-1: Out of band gain limits 1 for bands below 2496 MHz

  --------------------------------- --------------
  Frequency offset, f\_offset\_CW   Maximum gain
  0,2 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 1,0 MHz    60 dB
  1,0 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 5,0 MHz    45 dB
  5,0 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 10,0 MHz   45 dB
  10,0 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW          35 dB
  --------------------------------- --------------

Table 6.4.2-2: Out of band gain limits 1 for bands above 2496 MHz

  Frequency offset, f\_offset\_CW       Maximum gain
  ------------------------------------- --------------
  \[0,2\] \< f\_offset\_CW \< 4,0 MHz   60 dB
  4,0 \< f\_offset\_CW \< 15,0 MHz      45 dB
  15,0 MHz \< f\_offset\_CW             35 dB

6.5 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[5\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *channel
bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as
harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and
frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the Repeater transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* of *repeater type 1-C* DL and uplink *operating band*
of *repeater type 1-C* UL, plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and
Δf~OBUE~ below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency
range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in tables 6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.5.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band of repeater type 1-C DL*

  Repeater type       *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  Repeater type 1-C   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 200 MHz            10
                      200 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

Table 6.5.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink *operating band
of repeater 1-C UL*

  Repeater type       *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  Repeater type 1-C   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 200 MHz            10
                      200 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
                      200 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

There is no co-location unwanted emission requirement for LA 1-C
repeaters deployed in Femto cell scenario.

### 6.5.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.5.2.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *repeater type 1-C passband*
whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or
multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

For a *repeater* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.5.2.2 shall apply in *Gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.2-3, while the CACLR
requirement in clause 6.5.2.2 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.2-4.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.2
shall apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.5.2.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.2 shall
apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.5.2.2-4.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum requirements

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For *repeater type 1-C,* for DL (all repeater classes), and for UL for
WA class, either the ACLR (CACLR) absolute *minimum requirements* in
table 6.5.2.2-2, 6.5.2.2-5 or else the relevant the ACLR (CACLR)
*limits* in table 6.5.2.2-1, 6.5.2.2-3 or 6.5.2.2-4, whichever is less
stringent, shall apply for each *antenna connector*. For UL for LA
class, the ACLR (CACLR) limits in table 6.5.2.2-1a, 6.5.2.2-3 or
6.5.2.2-4a shall apply.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be
applied to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna
connectors* for *repeater type 1-C*.

classes) and for UL for Wide Area class

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a *gap
between passbands* or the *inter-passband gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
between passbands* or the *inter-passband gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *repeater type 1-C passband edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.5.3.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.5.2.2-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for NR carriers located on either side of the *gap between passbands* or
the *inter-passband gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.5.2.2-4.

classes) and for UL for Wide Area class

### 6.5.3 Operating band unwanted emissions 

#### 6.5.3.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for *repeater type 1-C* DL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑1
for the NR *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for *repeater type 1-C* UL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑2 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for *repeater type 1-C* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *gap
between passbands*. In addition, for a *repeater type 1-C* operating in
multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any *inter-passband*
*gap*.

*Limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band of repeater type 1-C DL and uplink operating
band of repeater type 1-C UL*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in tables
6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any ***inter-passband** gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined minimum requirement shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the minimum requirement specified at the
*repeater type 1-C passband edges* on each side of the
***inter-passband** gap*. The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C
Bandwidth edge* is specified in clauses 6.5.3.2.1 to 6.5.3.2.4 below,
where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation from the *repeater type 1-C passband
edge* frequency to the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *inter-passband gap* minus half of the
bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector of repeater type 1-C DL*, the operating band
unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are
carrier(s) transmitted in another supported downlink *operating band*.
In this case, no cumulative minimum requirement is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating band* with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission minimum requirement of the band
where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the
present clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirement of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined
in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset
(∆f~max~), shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up
to Δf~OBUE~ MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink
*operating band* without any carrier transmitted.

For a *multi-band connector of repeater type 1-C UL*, the operating band
unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported uplink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are
carrier(s) transmitted in another supported uplink *operating band*. In
this case, no cumulative minimum requirement is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported uplink *operating band* with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the inter-band gap between a supported uplink operating band
with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\* Δf~OBUE~, f\_offsetmax
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported uplink operating bands and the operating band
unwanted emission minimum requirement of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause,
shall apply across both uplink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirements of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as
defined in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency
offset (∆fmax), shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest
frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz above the highest frequency of the
supported uplink operating band without any carrier transmitted.

In addition, inside any *gap between passbands* for a *single-band
connector* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined minimum
requirement shall be applied which is the cumulative sum of the minimum
requirement specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the
*gap between passbands*. The minimum requirement for each *sub-block* is
specified in clauses 6.5.3.2.1 to 6.5.3.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passbands* bandwidth
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Wide Area *repeater type 1-C*, the requirements of either clause
6.5.3.2.1 (Category A limits) or clause 6.5.3.2.2 (Category B limits)
shall apply.

For Medium Range *repeater type 1-C*, the requirements in clause
6.5.3.2.3 shall apply (Category A and B).

For Local Area *repeater type 1-C*, the requirements of clause 6.5.3.2.4
shall apply (Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B minimum requirements
shall be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.5.4.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted
emissions limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over
all *antenna connectors* for *repeater type 1-C*.

In addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal
at DL input port, the requirements in table 6.5.2.2-2 shall apply. In
addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal at
UL input port, the requirements in clause 6.5.3.2.6 shall apply.

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirements

##### 6.5.3.2.1 Minimum requirements for Wide Area *repeater type 1-C* (Category A)

For repeater operating in Bands n5, n8, n12, n13, n14, n18, n26, n28,
n29, n71, n85, minimum requirements are specified in table 6.5.3.2.1‑1.

##### 6.5.3.2.5 Minimum requirements for additional requirements

##### 6.5.3.2.5.1 Limits in FCC Title 47 {#limits-in-fcc-title-47 .H6}

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.5.3.2.1, 6.5.3.2.2,
6.5.3.2.3 and 6.5.3.2.4, the *repeater type 1-C* may have to comply with
the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[10\], when
deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer.

##### 6.5.3.2.5.2 Protection of DTT {#protection-of-dtt .H6}

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *repeater type 1-C* operating in Band n20, the level of
emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth
on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table 6.5.3.2.5.2-1, a
minimum requirements P~EM,N~ is declared by the manufacturer. This
requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part
of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Table 6.5.3.2.5.2-1: Declared emissions *minimum requirement* for
protection of DTT

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Filter centre frequency, F~filter~**   ***Measurement bandwidth***   **Declared emission *minimum requirement* (dBm)**
  ---------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  F~filter~ = 8\*N + 306 (MHz);\           8 MHz                         P~EM,N~
  21 ≤ N ≤ 60                                                            

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
emissions at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including
antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides
the characteristics of the repeater needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be
determined using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[20\], annex F.

##### 6.5.3.2.6 Minimum requirements inside passband with no UL input signal

The requirement is defined as a function of frequency offset from the
edge of some part of passband with non-zero input signal. The
requirement is measured as the ratio of the repeater output power in a
zero-input basic unit to the repeater output power in a non-zero input
basic unit. Basic unit equal to 360 KHz.

The average of the basic requirements over 10 sub-frames shall not
exceed the values specified in table 6.5.3.2.6-1.

signal

### 6.5.4 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.5.4.1 General

For *repeater type 1-C*, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall
apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding

\- the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each
supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, where the
Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1 for downlink, or

\- the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each
supported uplink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~
is defined in table 6.5.1-2 for uplink

For some *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating
band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[5\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *Repeater type 1-C* shall
not exceed the *minimum requirements* defined in clause 6.5.5.2.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirements

##### 6.5.4.2.1 General transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *minimum requirements* of either table 6.5.4.2.1-1, table
6.5.4.2.1-2 (Category A limits) or table 6.5.4.2.1-3 (Category B limits)
shall apply. The application of either Category A or Category B limits
shall be the same as for operating band unwanted emissions in clause
6.5.3.

##### 6.5.4.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR *operating band*. It is
in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement
is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies,
since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of
regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *minimum requirements* are provided in table
6.5.4.2.2-1 where requirements for co-existence with the system listed
in the first column apply for *repeater type 1-C*. For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.5.4.2.2-1 apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a repeater
operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in table 6.5.4.2.3
-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the
downlink *operating band* (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this
excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.5.5.2.3 -1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: For unsynchronized operation, special co-existence requirements
may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For NR Band n28 repeater, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for repeater for co-existence with
E-UTRA Band 27 UL *operating band*.

NOTE 5: For NR Band n29 repeater, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for repeater for co-existence with
UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA
Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL
operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest repeater transmitter
frequency of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
clause 6.5.1.

The spurious emission *minimum requirements* for this requirement are:

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[12\], is defined in terms
of EIRP, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the
*antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.

The following requirement shall be applied to repeater operating in Band
n26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to
800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at
the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.5.4.2.3 Co-location with base stations and *repeater type 1-C* Nodes

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS,
IAB-DU, IAB-MT and *repeater type 1-C* receivers when GSM900, DCS1800,
PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU,
IAB-MT, or *repeater type 1-C* are co-located with *repeater type 1-C*.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with same class.

The *minimum requirements* are in table 6.5.4.2.3-1 for a *repeater type
1-C*. Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first
column apply, depending on the declared *repeater type 1-C* class. For a
*multi-band connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column
of table 6.5.4.2.3-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

requirements for co-location with BS, IAB-Node or repeater-Node

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.5.4.2.4-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit
frequency range of a *repeater type 1-C*. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[3\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.5.4.2.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would
be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

### 6.5.5 Receiver spurious emissions

#### 6.5.5.1 General

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector*. The requirements only apply to *repeater type 1-C* for TDD
operation.

For each a*ntenna connectors* on BS-side and UE-side supporting both RX
and TX in TDD, the requirements apply during the *transmitter OFF
state*. For *antenna connectors* both BS-side and UE-side in FDD, the RX
spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX spurious
emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.5.4.

For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF state*, and are subject to exclusion zones
in each supported *operating band*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of receiver spurious
emissions requirements over all *antenna connectors* for *repeater type
1-C* shall not exceed *minimum requirements* defined in clause 6.5.5.2.

#### 6.5.5.2 Minimum requirements

The receiver spurious emissions requirements for *repeater type 1-C* are
that for each *antenna connector,* the power of emissions shall not
exceed the value specified in table 6.5.5.2-1.

6.6 Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
-----------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of repeater and the measured
signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the equalization by
the measurement equipment. This difference is called the error vector.
Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as
specified in TS 38.104 \[2\] Annex B for FR1. The repeater EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed in percent.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.1.1-1.

#### 6.6.1.2 Minimum requirement

The repeater EVM levels for different modulation schemes outlined in
table 6.6.1.2-1 shall be met using the frame structure described in
clause 6.6.1.3.

#### 6.6.1.3 Repeater EVM frame structure for measurement

The input signals for the repeater EVM requirement shall have the same
frame structure as defined for the BS is TS 38.104 \[2\].

### 6.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference
between the reference waveform provided at the input of repeater and the
measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is
called the error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is
determined are the same as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] Annex F for
FR1. Before calculating the repeater EVM the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the repeater EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the repeater EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement
specified in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM
waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT
and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the
repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference
power expressed as a %.

The basic repeater EVM measurement interval in one slot in the time
domain. The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols
that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval,
as defined in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] clause 6.3.3 for EVM for UE.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.2.1-1.

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement

The RMS average of the basic repeater EVM measurements over 10 subframes
for the average repeater EVM case for the different modulation schemes
shall not exceed the values specified in table 6.6.2.2-1.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.7 Input intermodulation
-------------------------

### 6.7.1 General requirement

#### 6.7.1.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the *passband*, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the
*passband*.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater
during the *transmitter ON state*.

There is no co-location input intermodulation requirement for LA 1-C
repeaters deployed in Femto cell scenario.

#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirement

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.1.2-1, the power in the
*passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured with 1 MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the *passband*.

Table 6.7.1.2-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals,
where:

\- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the
first or last channel in the *passband* of the closer carrier.

Table 6.7.1.2-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  **f~1~ offset**   **Interfering Signal Levels**   **Type of signals**   **Measurement bandwidth**
  ----------------- ------------------------------- --------------------- ---------------------------
  1 MHz             -40 dBm                         2 CW carriers         1 MHz

### 6.7.2 Co-location with BS/repeater in other systems

#### 6.7.2.1 General

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of RF repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS
or repeater operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
a RF repeater.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater. If
the BS side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the downlink. If
the UE side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the uplink.

#### 6.7.2.2 Minimum requirement

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.2.2-1 for DL and 6.7.2.2-2 for
UL, the power in the *passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB
at the output of the repeater as measured with 1MHz measurement
bandwidth, compared to the level obtained without interfering signals
applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the *passband*.

### 6.7.3 Co-existence with other systems

#### 6.7.3.1 General

This input intermodulation existence requirement may be applied for the
protection of RF repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS
or repeater operating in another frequency band co-exist with a RF
repeater.

#### 6.7.3.2 Minimum requirement

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.3.2-1, the power in the
*passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured with 1MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the *passband*.

6.8 Output intermodulation
--------------------------

### 6.8.1 General

The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the repeater to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering
signal reaching the repeater via the output port. The requirement shall
apply during the *transmitter ON state* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater.

For *repeater type 1-C*, the output intermodulation level is the power
of the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected
into the *antenna connector*.

### 6.8.2 Minimum requirements for *repeater type 1-C*

#### 6.8.2.1 Minimum requirements

The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an interfering signal is injected into the output port.
The wanted signal *passband* shall be the maximum bandwidth supported by
the repeater.

For *repeater type 1-C*, the wanted signal and interfering signal centre
frequency is specified in table 6.8.2.1‑1, where interfering signal
level is *rated total output power* (P~rated,t,AC~) at *antenna
connector* in the *passband* -- 30 dB.

The unwanted emission with output intermodulation applied shall not
exceed the corresponding uplink and downlink unwanted emission limits in
clause 6.5 in the presence of an interfering signal according to
table 6.8.2.1-1. The measurement may be limited to frequencies on which
third and fifth order intermodulation products appear, considering the
width of these products.

6.9 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
-------------------------------------------

### 6.9.1 General

Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average gain
over a carrier of the repeater in the *passband* to the average gain of
the repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater *passband*.
The carrier in the *passband* and in the adjacent channel shall be of
the same type (reference carrier) with bandwidths as defined by *nominal
channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater,
where the donor link is maintained via antennas (wireless Repeater).

The requirement is differentiated between uplink and downlink.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

### 6.9.2 Minimum Requirements

For a repeater operating at *passband* below 2496 MHz, the ACRR
requirements in table 6.9.2-1 shall apply in downlink. ACRR for downlink
shall be higher than the value specified in the table 6.9.2-1.

6.10 Transmit ON/OFF power
--------------------------

### 6.10.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.10.1.1 General

Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the
repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of the
repeater.

Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the *passband
bandwidth* of the repeater (BW~passband~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF state*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz of the input signal.

For *multi-band connectors* and for *single band connectors* supporting
transmission in multiple *operating bands*, the requirement is only
applicable during the *transmitter OFF state* in all supported
*operating bands*.

#### 6.10.1.2 Minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C*

For *repeater type 1-C downlink*, the requirements for transmitter OFF
power spectral density shall be less than -85 dBm/MHz per *antenna
connector*.

For *repeater type 1-C uplink*, the requirements for transmitter OFF
power spectral density shall be less than -50dBm /
(SCS\*(12\*N~RB~+1)/1000) MHz per *antenna connector,* where SCS is Sub
Carrier Spacing in kHz.

### 6.10.2 Transmitter transient period

#### 6.10.2.1 General

*Transmitter transient period* requirements apply only to TDD operation
of the repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of
the repeater.

The *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the *transmitter OFF state* to the
*transmitter ON state* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient period*
is illustrated in figure 6.10.2.1-1.

Figure 6.10.2.1-1: Example of relations between *transmitter ON state*,
*transmitter OFF state* and *transmitter transient period*

For *repeater type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the
*antenna connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*. The
beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced to
the slot timing at the input.

#### 6.10.2.2 Minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C*

For *repeater type 1-C*, the *transmitter transient period* shall be
shorter than the values listed in the minimum requirement table
6.10.2.2-1.

period* for *repeater type 1-C*

7 Radiated characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

Radiated characteristics are specified at RIB for *repeater type 2-O*.
Requirements apply in both DL and UL unless otherwise stated or
declared.

All requirements are defined for normal conditions, unless otherwise
stated.

7.2 OTA output power
--------------------

### 7.2.1 General

*Repeater type 2-O* are declared to support one or more beams, as per
manufacturer\'s declarations specified in TS 38.115-2 \[8\]. Radiated
transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a
specific *beam peak direction*.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, beamwidth, *rated beam EIRP*,
*OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the maximum
steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
beamwidth(s).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the repeater is declared to radiate at
the associated *beam peak direction*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in TS 38.115-2 \[8\].

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *pass bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW) is
larger than 6%, two rated beam EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated beam EIRP
is:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

OTA repeater output power is also declared as a TRP radiated
requirement, with the output power accuracy requirement defined at the
RIB. TRP does not change with beamforming settings as long as the *beam
peak direction* is within the *OTA peak directions set*. Thus, the TRP
accuracy requirement shall be met for any beamforming setting for which
the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak directions set*.

There is no upper limit for the *rated TRP output power* and the *rated
beam EIRP output power* of *repeater type 2-O* DL transmission.

The *repeater rated TRP output power* and the *rated beam EIRP output
power* for *repeater type 2-O* UL transmission shall be within limits as
specified in table 9.2.1-1.

type 2-O* UL transmission

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirement

for the *OTA peak directions set* when operating in the opposite DL/UL
direction.

The requirements shall apply with NR signals in the *passband* of the
repeater at:

The lowest input power (P~p,in,EIRP~) that produces the *rated passband
TRP output power* (P~rated,p,TRP~)

Up to:

The lowest input power (P~p,in,EIRP~) that produces the *rated passband
TRP output power* (P~rated,p,TRP~), plus 10dB.

In normal conditions, the measured output power, P~max,p,EIRP~ shall
remain within +3.4 dB and -3.4 dB of the *rated beam EIRP output power*
P~rated,p,EIRP~, declared by the manufacturer.

In extreme conditions, the measured output power, P~max,p,,EIRP~ shall
remain within +4.5 dB and -4.5 dB of the *rated beam EIRP output power*
P~rated,p,EIRP~, declared by the manufacturer.

In normal conditions, the *repeater type 2-O* *maximum passband TRP
output power*, P~max,p~,~TRP~ measured at the RIB shall remain within ±3
dB of the *rated passband TRP output power* P~rated,p,TRP~, as declared
by the manufacturer.

7.3 OTA frequency stability
---------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

Frequency stability is the ability to maintain the same frequency on the
output signal with respect to the input signal.

OTA frequency stability requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The frequency deviation of the output signal with respect to the input
signal shall be no more than ±0,01 PPM.

7.4 OTA out of band gain
------------------------

### 7.4.1 General

Out of band gain refers to the gain of the repeater outside the
*passband*.

The requirement is based on the ratio of TRP output power to directional
input power.

The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in-band
signals and not to amplify signals outside of the *passband*.

In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is
less than lowest expected the coupling loss to the nearest source of
emissions.

### 7.4.2 Minimum requirement

The gain outside the *passband* shall not exceed the maximum level
specified in table 7.4.2-1, where:

\- f\_offset\_CW is the offset between the outer channel edge frequency
of the outer channel in the *passband* and a CW signal.

Table 7.4.2-1: Out of band gain limits 1

  Frequency offset, f\_offset\_CW                                   Maximum gain
  ----------------------------------------------------------------- --------------
  0.1\*Minimum {400MHz, *passband* BW} ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 150 MHz   68 dB
  150 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 400 MHz                                55 dB
  400 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< f\_offset\_max                         35 dB

7.5 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 7.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[5\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *passband* resulting from the modulation process
and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *repeater type 2-O*
transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power
Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE). OTA Unwanted
emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious
emissions requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined
in table 7.5.1-1 for *repeater type 2-O* for NR *operating bands*.

Table 7.5.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink *operating
band for repeater type 2-O*

  **Repeater type**     ***Operating band* characteristics**   **Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)**
  --------------------- -------------------------------------- --------------------
  *Repeater type 2-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz     1500

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* or co-location requirements as
described per requirement.

### 7.5.2 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 7.5.2.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
state*.

#### 7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O*

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 7.5.2.2-1 for DL and UL for
Wide Area class and DL for Local Area class.

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 7.5.2.2-1a for UL for Local
Area class.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit is specified in table 7.5.2.2-2.

Either the OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit in table 7.5.2.2-2 or
7.5.2.2-5 or the relevant ACLR (CACLR) limit in table 7.5.2.2-1,
7.5.2.2-1a, 7.5.2.2-3, 7.5.5.2-3a, 7.5.2.2-4 or 7.5.2.2-4a, whichever is
less stringent, shall apply.

For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA ACLR
requirement in table 7.5.2.2-3 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR
requirement in table 7.5.2.2-4 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *gap between passbands* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
between passbands*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *passband* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 7.5.2.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 7.5.2.2-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *gap between passbands* shall be higher
than the value specified in table 7.5.2.2-4.

### 7.5.3 OTA operating band unwanted emissions

#### 7.5.3.1 General

The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as
TRP per RIB unless otherwise stated.

In addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal,
-13dBm/MHz shall apply for all classes DL and UL.

#### 7.5.3.2 Minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O*

##### 7.5.3.2.1 General

The requirements of either clause 7.5.3.2.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 7.5.3.2.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*repeater type 2-O*) in
clause 7.5.3.3.2. In addition, the limits in clause 7.5.3.2.4 may also
apply.

Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits.

For *repeater type 2-O*, unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 7.5.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in contiguous CA, the requirements
apply to the frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the edge of the
*passband.* In addition, for a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *gap between passbands*.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *passband*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 7.5.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In addition, inside any *gap between passbands* for a *RIB* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the *limits* specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of
the *gap between passbands*. The *limit* for each *sub-block* is
specified in clauses 7.5.3.2.2 and 7.5.3.2.3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passbands* bandwidth
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the repeater-Node. The limits
may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in
the same geographical area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.

7.6 OTA Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
---------------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 7.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of the repeater and the
measured signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the
equalization by the measurement equipment. This difference is called the
error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are same
as specified in TS 38.104 \[2\] Annex C for FR2. The repeater EVM result
is defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector
power to the mean reference power expressed in percent.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range*
on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of the received
signal is in the reference direction at the receive side.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is
operating with an input power level within the range from what is
required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (P~rated,p,EIRP~) to
the minimum power levels in table 7.6.1.1-1.

#### 7.6.1.3 Repeater EVM frame structure for measurement

The input signals for the repeater EVM requirement shall have the same
frame structure as defined for the BS is TS 38.104 \[2\].

### 7.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 7.6.2.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference
between the reference waveform provided at the input of repeater and the
measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is
called the error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is
determined are the same as specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F for
FR2. Before calculating the repeater EVM, the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the repeater EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified
in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] clauses 6.4.2.4 and 6.4.2.5. For DFT-s-OFDM
waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT
and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the
repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference
power expressed as a %.

The basic repeater EVM measurement interval is one slot in the time
domain. The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols
that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval
as defined in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] clause 6.3.3.

All the parameters defined in clause 7.6.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range*
on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of the received
signal is in the reference direction at the receive side.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is
operating with an input power level within the range from what is
required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (P~rated,p,EIRP~) to
the minimum input power levels in table 7.6.2.1-1.

  Note 1: support of 64QAM is based on the declaration              

7.7 OTA input intermodulation
-----------------------------

### 7.7.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the *passband*, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the
*passband*. The requirement is defined as a directional requirement.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction:

The interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of polarization match.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater
during the *transmitter ON state*.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement

For the parameters specified in table 7.7.2-1, the power in the
*passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured with 1 MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the whole *passband*.

Table 7.7.2-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals,
where:

\- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the
first or last channel in the *passband* of the closer carrier.

\- G~RX\_ANT~ is the gain of the receive side antennas and is calculated
from EIRP and TRP declaration.

Table 7.7.2-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  1 MHz         -53dBm -- G~\_RX\_ANT~      2 CW carriers     1 MHz

7.8 OTA Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
-----------------------------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average
gain over a carrier of the repeater in the *passband* to the average
gain of the repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater
*passband*. The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of
the Repeater. The bandwidth of the channel inside the *passband* and the
adjacent channel shall be of the same type (reference carrier) with
bandwidths as defined by *nominal channel bandwidth*.

The requirement is differentiated between downlink and uplink.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

The ACRR is a ratio of gain in the adjacent channel to gain in the
wanted channel. The gain in each case is defined as the ratio of TRP
output power to directional input power.

### 7.8.2 Minimum Requirements

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal in the *passband* and a received signal on an
adjacent channel outside repeater *passband* is from the same direction
and are the same as the TX reference direction for the opposite DL/UL
setting*.*

For a repeater operating at *passband* operating in FR2, the ACRR
requirements in table 7.8.2-1 shall apply in downlink. ACRR for downlink
shall be higher than the value specified in the table 7.8.2-1.

7.9 OTA transmit ON/OFF power
-----------------------------

### 7.9.1 General

OTA transmit ON/OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of
repeater. The requirements apply to both downlink and uplink of the
repeater.

### 7.9.2 OTA transmitter OFF power

#### 7.9.2.1 General

OTA transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over
70/N µs filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
*passband bandwidth* of the repeater (BW~passband~ ) centred on the
assigned channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF state*. N =
SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz of the input signal. The
OTA transmitter OFF power is defined as TRP.

#### 7.9.2.2 Minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O*

The OTA transmitter OFF TRP spectral density for *repeater type 2-O*
shall be less than ‑36 dBm/MHz.

### 7.9.3 OTA transient period

#### 7.9.3.1 General

The OTA *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which
the transmitter is changing from the tra*nsmitter OFF state* to the
*transmitter ON state* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient period*
is illustrated in figure 7.9.3.1-1.

Figure 7.9.3.1-1: Example of relations between *transmitter ON state*,
*transmitter OFF state* and *transmitter transient period*

This requirement shall be applied at each RIB supporting transmission in
the *operating band*. The beginning and end point of downlink and uplink
bursts are referenced to the slot timing at the input.

#### 7.9.3.2 Minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O*

For *repeater type 2-O*, the OTA *transmitter transient period* shall be
shorter than the values listed in the minimum requirement table
7.9.3.2-1.

Table 7.9.3.2-1: Minimum requirement for the OTA *transmitter transient
period* for *repeater type 2-O*
