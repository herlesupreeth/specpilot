This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document is a technical report deals with the use of the
Rail Mobile Radio spectrum in the 900 MHz frequency band in CEPT
countries which are subject to the ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] for the use
by the railways. The purpose is to gather the relevant background
information and studies in order to address all the necessary
precautions to make the paired spectrum of 874.6-800/919.4-925 MHz
usable for 5G NR.

Based on the current NR specification and the RMR900 WID scope, the
above requirements for 200 kHz and 5.6 MHz channels are not applicable.

Referring to ECC Decision 20(02) table 2 \[1\], the "general" in-block
requirement as presented on table 4.3.1-3 is not mandatory. This
requirement is intended to provide guidance to the national
administrations in case an upper bound for the EIRP output power would
be desired. Therefore, the general in-block requirement in table 4.3.1-3
is not considered as the baseline for general OBUE requirements for NR
BS.

7 RF requirements
=================

7.1 BS specific requirements
----------------------------

### 7.1.1 General

According to ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], the BS RF work for RMR900 is
limited to the Wide Area Base Stations, determined by the use along
railway lines and their corresponding characteristics defined by 3GPP TS
38.104 \[4\].

In accordance to ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], the related studies es were
done for the non-AAS BS architectures, defined in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\].
Therefore the RAN4 requirements derivation was limited to the BS type
1-C requirements, only.

As the EIRP limits were defined in the ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\],
consideration of non-AAS BS architecture required to convert those EIRP
limits into the conducted requirements assuming a maximum gain that can
vary depending on the used antenna and related antenna gain as well as
the potential losses, e.g., feeder. In the present consideration an
antenna gain of 17 dBi and 4 dB losses are assumed in accordance to
ECC Report 318 \[5\] resulting to a maximum gain value of G~maxRMR900~ =
13 dBi, encompassing internal losses (feeder, etc.) of 0 dB. Other
assumptions may lead to other maximum gain values and conducted
requirements. Also, one antenna connector was assumed. If the BS has
more than one antenna connector, the limits shall be re-calculated
considering the intended number of antenna connectors serving a cell.

### 7.1.2 Transmitter characteristics

#### 7.1.2.1 BS maximum output power

Based on ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] and clarifications in R4-2400334
\[9\], there were two scenarios considered for FRMCS deployment:

1\. Uncoordinated FRMCS deployment, with the output power limit
specified in ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\],

2\. Coordinated FRMCS deployment, where no output power limit was
defined for the Wide Area BS class.

For the bullet 1 above, the maximum output power for BS operating in
band n100 applicable for uncoordinated deployment, should not exceed the
P~rated,c,AC~ derived based on table 4.3.1-1 EIRP limits, with the
assumption of maximum gain value of the BS antenna gain G~maxRMR900~,
and assuming one antenna connector, as:

(64.5 -- G~maxRMR900~) dBm / 5 MHz + (f~DL~-922.1) x 40/3 dB =
51.5 dBm/5MHz + (f~DL ~- 922.1) × 40/3 dB,

where G~maxRMR900~ is the maximum gain (antenna gain and losses) for the
RMR900 BS consideration.

NOTE: Based on inputs received in R4-2400334 \[9\], it was further
clarified by the CEPT ECC WG FM that both uncoordinated, as well as
coordinated deployments shall be considered by RAN4 specification for
FRMCS deployment of band n100. Therefore, output power limits higher
that the above listed EIRP are also possible for FRMCS in band n100,
subject to coordination.

#### 7.1.2.2 Unwanted emissions

##### 7.1.2.1.1 General

Only Category B emission requirements are applicable to NR operation in
n100 band.

##### 7.1.2.1.2 OBUE

Emission mask of the OBUE Cat B Option 2 limits in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\]
applicable to Europe was compared to the one derived from
ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], in order to verify the need for additional
RMR-specific OBUE requirement introduction.

The following was observed:

\- Both masks were derived with different measurement bandwidths;

\- Emission limits comparison (after measurement bandwidths scaling)
revealed that the existing OBUE Cat B Option 2 mask is more stringent
only for part of the ∆f offset range (∆f \< 0.2 MHz).

Based on the above motivation the following OBUE requirement are
necessary for band n100 in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\], based on conversion of
the EIRP limits from ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], as summarized in
table 7.1.2.1.2-1. The requirement is derived based on table 4.3.1-4,
with the assumption of a maximum gain value of the BS G~maxRMR900~:

Based on inputs received in R4-2400334 \[9\], it was clarified by the
CEPT ECC WG FM that the above limit was derived based on MSR
specification and can be removed from NR BS specification. Therefore,
the additional OBUE limit for n100 was removed from Rel-17
specifications TS 38.104 clause 6.6.4.2.5.7, and TS 38.141-1 clause
6.6.4.5.6.7.

##### 7.1.2.1.3 Tx spurious emissions

The following Tx spurious emission requirements are considered for band
n100 in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\], based on conversion of the EIRP limits
from ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], as summarized in table 7.1.2.1.3-1:

### 7.1.3 Receiver characteristics

#### 7.1.3.1 Void

#### 7.1.3.2 Rx blocking 

##### 7.1.3.2.1 CEPT context

The requirement for performance against an interferer appears in Table 7
of ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\]. Tracing its origin within CEPT work, it is
the result undertaken under ECC report 313 \[6\] in section 6.1 ("500
MILLIWATT SRD") and ECC report 313 \[6\] further indicates "Full
technical characteristics of SRD considered in this Report are given in
ANNEX 2". Table 25 of ECC report 313 \[6\] also provides characteristics
of the SRD interferer. The present description is derived from the LS
response received from ETSI TC RT in R4-210431 \[7\].

##### 7.1.3.2.2 Analysis

Several characteristics of the interferer need to be taken into account
when defining the conformance test:

\- Table 7 of ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] identifies the requirement as
"Maximum interfering signal in 870-874.4 MHz".

\- The corresponding requirement is -34 dBm for 3 dB desensitization
which can be converted to -29.2 dBm for 6 dB desensitization.

\- The interferer is less than 200 kHz which may fit to a GSM carrier or
a narrowband interferer.

\- The duty cycle of SRD devices is regulated by EU with
ECC report 313 \[6\] indicating ≤ 10% for fixed Network Access Points
and ≤ 2.5% otherwise.

\- The requirement covers both "blocking and IM3".

3GPP conformance tests do not usually consider duty cycle of the
interferer and express the interfering signal according to its mean
power. In this particular instance that the aggressor system being
regulated at EU level and the ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] stating a
"maximum" interfering signal level, it is assumed to express for the
conformance test the interfering signal under a similar scheme of
"interfering signal mean power".

For a duty cycle of 2.5%, a -29 dBm signal max power has a mean power of
-45 dBm (i.e. correction by 16 dB).

For a duty cycle of 10%, a -29 dBm signal max power has a mean power of
-39 dBm (i.e. correction by 10 dB).

Since the interfering signal power for 10% duty cycle is higher, -39dBm
interfering signal mean power has been considered in the 3GPP
requirement.

#### 7.1.3.3 Characteristics

##### 7.1.3.3.1 Blocking

For narrowband blocking, the following interferer characteristics need
to be considered for band n100 in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\].

\- Duty cycle of the narrowband interferer: 10%

\- Interfering signal mean power: -39 dBm

\- Wanted signal mean power (dBm): PREFSENS + 6 dB

\- Interfering Signal: 5 MHz DFT-s-OFDM NR signal, 15 kHz SCS, 1 RB

\- Interfering RB centre frequency: 874.4 MHz -(350 kHz +m\*180), m=0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 19

> NOTE: It is assumed that the 5MHz interfering signal does not overlap
> with the wanted signal channel bandwidth. Otherwise, the minimum
> offset is 90 kHz (half a RB).

##### 7.1.3.3.2 Intermodulation

For intermodulation, the following interferer characteristics shall be
considered for band n100 in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\].

\- Duty cycle of the narrowband interferer: 10%

\- Interfering signal mean power: -39 dBm

\- Wanted signal mean power (dBm): PREFSENS + 6 dB

For the interfering signal, it is proposed to use the definitions in
accordance with Table 7.7.2-4 of 3GPP TS 38.104 \[3\] for a 5 MHz
channel.

7.2 UE specific requirements

### 7.2.1 Transmitter characteristics

### 7.2.3 Additional requirements for RMR cab-radio receivers using wideband technologies

In ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] Annex 2, additional requirements have been
introduced for 900 MHz RMR cab-radio receivers that reflect the specific
train deployment case with UE antenna placed on top of the trains at
approximately 4 m over ground and having an effective antenna gain of 2
dBi.

The requirements in Table 7.2.3-1 are covered in the ETSI TS 103 793
\[10\].

8 Performance requirements
==========================

The High Speed Train (HST) BS demodulation requirements are to be
transparently applied for the NR operation in the RMR900 operating band.

9 Deployment aspects
====================

In general, network deployment aspects are out of scope of the RAN4
work. For the derivation of the BS RF requirements it was assumed that
the RMR and MFCN base stations are not co-located. It was identified
afterwards that such scenarios may actually happen in the field.

Co-location of a MFCN BS and a RMR BS requires coordination among the
involved parties.

In accordance with ECC Decision (20)02 Decides 4 \[1\], in case of
implementation of coordination procedures or other mitigation measures
for band n100 deployments it is possible to deploy higher E.I.R.P. than
stated in the technical conditions in ECC Decision (20)02 Annex 2 \[1\].
This has been further confirmed by the CEPT ECC WG FM feedback in
R4-2400334 \[9\], where RAN4 was asked to consider both coordinated, as
well as uncoordinated deployments.

For uncoordinated deployment the technical conditions stated in ECC
Decision (20)02 Annex 2 \[1\] apply for the in-block requirements, i.e.
output power limit applies for band n100 operation.

The use of spectrum and its related conditions, e.g., E.I.R.P, in
accordance to ECC Decision (20)02 Part B \[1\], are in the
responsibility of national regulation and coordination among involved
parties.

10 Conclusion
=============

The study dealt with how the RMR900MHz spectrum (874.4 - 880 MHz/ 919.4
- 925 MHz) can be used for rail communication using 5G NR applicable in
Europe. The corresponding system parameters, BS RF parameter and UE RF
parameter were examined:

\- General: The focus was on the use of RMR900 under uncoordinated
deployment conditions, assuming that RMR BS operates independently of
other operators e.g. MFCN, however based on CEPT ECC WG FM clarification
received in R4-2400334 \[9\], also coordinated deployments have to be
considered. Co-location with other operators and resulting coordination
is subject to national regulation and is outside the scope of this work
item.

\- System Parameters: The RMR900 spectrum block can be used by 5MHz CBW
reusing Rel-15 sync raster design. For channel bandwidths smaller than 5
MHz, related objectives were covered in a separate Rel-18 work item on
NR support for dedicated spectrum less than 5MHz in RP-220401 \[11\].

\- BS RF: Based on the ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], the EIRP limits were
analysed accordingly and the necessary conclusions for an uncoordinated
operational approach were derived to define conducted power
requirements. However, based on CEPT ECC WG FM clarification received in
R4-2400334 \[9\], also coordinated deployments have to be considered.
These include the BS rated output power using corresponding assumptions,
the resulting emission values of the transmitter and the specifications
of the receiver. Furthermore, the coexistence with other 3GPP radio
technologies has been included.

\- UE RF: Based on the ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], the EIRP limits were
analysed accordingly, and the necessary conclusions were derived for the
use of Power Class 3 (23 dBm).

PC1 (31dBm) power class was introduced for the cab-radio after
completion of Rel-17, with the derivation of Tx requirements captured in
TR 37.829 \[8\]. For related PC1 cab‑radio Rx characteristics for band
n100 refer to ETSI TS 103 793 \[10\].
