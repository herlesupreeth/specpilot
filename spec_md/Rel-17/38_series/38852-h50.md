This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document is a technical report deals with the use of the
Rail Mobile Radio spectrum in the 1900MHz frequency band in CEPT
countries which are subject to the ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] for the use
by the railways. The purpose is to gather the relevant background
information and studies in order to address all the necessary
precautions to make the unpaired spectrum of 1900-1910MHz usable for 5G
NR.

7 RF requirements
=================

7.1 BS specific requirements
----------------------------

### 7.1.1 General

According to ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], the BS RF work for RMR1900 is
limited to the Wide Area Base Stations, determined by the use along
railway lines and their corresponding characteristics defined by 3GPP TS
38.104 \[4\].

In accordance to ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], the related studies were
done for the non-AAS BS architectures, defined in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\].
Therefore, the RAN4 requirements derivation was limited to the BS type
1-C requirements, only.

As the EIRP limits were defined in the ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\],
consideration of non-AAS BS architecture required to convert those EIRP
limits into the conducted requirements assuming a maximum antenna gain
that can vary depending on the used antenna and related antenna gain as
well as the potential losses, e.g., feeder. In the present consideration
an antenna gain of 18 dBi and 4 dB losses in accordance to
ECC Report 318 \[6\] resulting to a maximum gain value of G~maxRMR1900~
= 14 dBi. Other assumptions may lead to other maximum gain values and
conducted requirements. Also, one antenna connector was assumed. If the
BS has more than one antenna connector, the limits shall be
re-calculated considering the intended number of antenna connectors
serving a cell.

### 7.1.2 Transmitter characteristics

#### 7.1.2.1 BS maximum output power

Based on ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] and clarifications in \[8\], there
were two scenarios considered for FRMCS deployment:

1\. Uncoordinated FRMCS deployment, with the output power limit
specified in ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\],

2\. Coordinated FRMCS deployment, where no output power limit was
defined for the Wide Area BS class.

For the bullet 1 above, the maximum output power for BS operating in
band n101 applicable for uncoordinated deployment, should not exceed the
P~rated,c,AC~ derived based on table 4.3.1-1 EIRP limits, with the
assumption of a maximum value of the BS G~maxRMR1900~, and assuming one
antenna connector, as:

(65 -- G~maxRMR1900~) dBm / 10 MHz = 51 dBm / 10 MHz,

(62 -- G~antRMR1900~) dBm / 5 MHz = 48 dBm / 5 MHz,

where G~maxRMR1900~ is the maximum gain (antenna gain and losses) of the
RMR 1900 BS consideration.

NOTE 1: 5 MHz channel bandwidth support was not considered in ECC
Decision (20)02 \[1\] and was added on request of RMR operators. The
above limit for 5 MHz channel bandwidth was then specified based on the
limit for 10 MHz, keeping constant PSD.

NOTE 2: Based on inputs received in \[8\], it was further clarified by
the CEPT ECC WG FM that both uncoordinated, as well as coordinated
deployments shall be considered by RAN4 specification for FRMCS
deployment in band n101. Therefore, the output power limits higher that
65 dBm EIRP are also possible for FRMCS in band n101, subject to
deployment coordination.

#### 7.1.2.2 Unwanted emissions

##### 7.1.2.2.1 General

Only Category B emission requirements are applicable to NR operation in
RMR1900 band.

##### 7.1.2.2.2 Tx spurious emissions

Additional Tx spurious emission requirements are considered for **band
n101** in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\], based on conversion of the EIRP limits
from ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], as summarized in table 7.1.2.2.2-1. The
requirement is derived based on table 4.3.1-5, with the assumption of
maximum gain value of the BS G~maxRMR1900~:

Table 7.1.2.2.2-1: Additional Tx spurious emissions requirement
derivation for n101

  Spurious frequency range                                                                                               *Basic limit*                             *Measurement bandwidth*

  NOTE: Assuming a 14dBi maximum gain (antenna gain and losses) for G~maxRMR1900~, and assuming one antenna connector.                                             

### 7.1.3 Receiver characteristics

RAN4 will not specify requirements related to the CEPT assumptions for
BS enhanced selectivity operating adjacent to band n1 and deployed close
by the corresponding railway infrastructure.

#### 7.1.3.2 Rx blocking 

Rx blocking requirements applicable for band n101 in
3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\], based on conversion of the EIRP limits from
ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], are summarized in table 7.1.3.2-1.
Interfering signal characteristic is 5 MHz LTE signal, as specified in
ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\].

### 7.2.3 Additional requirements for RMR cab-radio receivers using wideband technologies

In ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\] Annex 3, additional requirements have been
introduced for 1900 MHz RMR cab-radio receivers that reflect the
specific train deployment case with UE antenna placed on top of the
trains at approximately 4m over ground and having an effective antenna
gain of 2dBi.

Table 7.2.3-1: RMR cab-radio receivers using wideband technologies \[1\]

+----------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| Level of the wanted signal                         | RefSens + 3 dB |
+====================================================+================+
| Maximum 5 MHz LTE interfering signal in 1805-1880  | -13 dBm        |
| MHz                                                |                |
+----------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| Maximum 5 MHz LTE interfering signal in 1920-1980  | -39 dBm        |
| MHz                                                |                |
+----------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| Note 1: The antenna connector of the radio module  |                |
| is the reference point. The reference sensitivity  |                |
| (RefSens) is the minimum mean power received at    |                |
| the antenna connector at which a specified minimum |                |
| performance shall be met.                          |                |
|                                                    |                |
| Note 2: These requirements cover both blocking and |                |
| third-order intermodulation.                       |                |
+----------------------------------------------------+----------------+

The requirements in Table 7.2.3-1 are covered in the ETSI TS 103 793
\[9\].

8 Performance requirements
==========================

The High Speed Train (HST) BS demodulation requirements are to be
transparently applied for the NR operation in the RMR1900 operating
band.

9 Deployment aspects
====================

In general, network deployment aspects are out of scope of the RAN4
work. For the derivation of the BS RF requirements it was assumed that
the RMR and MFCN base stations are not co-located. It was identified
afterwards that such scenarios may actually happen in the field.

Co-location of a MFCN BS and a RMR BS requires coordination among the
involved parties.

In accordance with ECC Decision (20)02 Decides 4 \[1\], in case of
implementation of coordination procedures or other mitigation measures
for band n101 deployments, it is possible to deploy higher E.I.R.P. than
stated in the technical conditions in ECC Decision (20)02 Annex 3 \[1\].
This has been further confirmed by the CEPT ECC WG FM feedback in \[8\],
where RAN4 was asked to consider both coordinated, as well as
uncoordinated deployments.

For uncoordinated deployment the technical conditions stated in ECC
Decision (20)02 Annex 3 \[1\] apply for the in-block requirements, i.e.
output power limit applies for band n101 operation.

The use of spectrum and its related conditions, e.g., E.I.R.P, in
accordance to ECC Decision (20)02 Part B \[1\], are in the
responsibility of national regulation and coordination among involved
parties.

10 Conclusion
=============

The study dealt with how the 1900-1910 MHz spectrum block (RMR1900) can
be used for rail communication using 5G NR applicable in CEPT countries.
The subject-areas 5G NR system, BS RF and UE RF were examined in detail.

General: The focus was on the use of RMR1900 under uncoordinated
conditions, assuming that RMR BS operates independently of other
operators e.g. MFCN, however based on CEPT ECC WG FM clarification
received in R4-2400334 \[8\], also coordinated deployments have to be
considered. Co-location with other operators and resulting coordination
is subject to national regulation and will be not further detailed by
3GPP RAN4.

System Parameter: The RMR1900 spectrum block can be used by either a 10
MHz CBW or a 5 MHz CBW. The corresponding system parameters are to be
transferred to 3GPP TS 38.101-1 \[2\] and 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\].

BS RF: The ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], i.e. EIRP limits were analysed
accordingly and the necessary conclusions for an uncoordinated
operational approach were derived. However, based on CEPT ECC WG FM
clarification received in R4-2400334 \[8\], also coordinated deployments
have to be considered. These include the BS rated output power using
corresponding assumptions, the resulting emission values of the
transmitter and the specifications of the receiver. The agreed
parameters are to be transferred to 3GPP TS 38.104 \[4\]. Furthermore,
the coexistence with other 3GPP radio technologies has been included.
These are to be captured in the corresponding normative 3GPP technical
specifications.

UE RF: Based on ECC Decision (20)02 \[1\], the EIRP limits were analysed
accordingly, and the necessary conclusions were derived for the use of
Power Class 3 (23dBm).

PC1 (31dBm) power class was introduced for the cab-radio after
completion of Rel-17, with the derivation of Tx requirements captured in
in TR 37.829 \[7\]. For related PC1 cab radio Rx characteristics for
band n101 refer to ETSI TS 103 793 \[9\].
