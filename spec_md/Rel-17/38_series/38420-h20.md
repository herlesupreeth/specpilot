4 General aspects
=================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The interface allowing to interconnect NG-RAN nodes with each other is
referred to as the Xn interface.

4.2 Xn interface general principles
-----------------------------------

The general principles for the specification of the Xn interface are as
follows:

\- the Xn interface is open;

\- the Xn interface supports the exchange of signalling information
between two NG-RAN nodes, and the forwarding of PDUs to the respective
tunnel endpoints;

\- from a logical standpoint, the Xn is a point-to-point interface
between two NG-RAN nodes. A point-to-point logical interface should be
feasible even in the absence of a physical direct connection between the
two NG-RAN nodes.

4.3 Xn interface specification objectives
-----------------------------------------

The Xn interface specifications facilitate the following:

\- inter-connection of NG-RAN nodes supplied by different manufacturers;

\- support of continuation between NG-RAN nodes of the NG-RAN services
offered via the NG interface;

\- separation of Xn interface Radio Network functionality and Transport
Network functionality to facilitate introduction of future technology.

4.4 Xn interface capabilities
-----------------------------

The Xn interface supports:

\- procedures to support intra-NG-RAN mobility;

\- procedures to support dual connectivity between NG-RAN nodes.

7 Xn interface protocol structure
=================================

7.1 Xn Control Plane
--------------------

The control plane protocol stack of the Xn interface is shown on Figure
7.1-1. The transport network layer is built on IP transport. For the
reliable transport of signalling messages, SCTP is added on top of IP.
The application layer signalling protocol is referred to as XnAP (Xn
Application Protocol).

Figure 7.1-1: Xn Interface Control Plane

7.2 Xn User Plane
-----------------

The Xn user plane (Xn-U) interface is defined between two NG-RAN nodes.
The Xn-U interface provides non-guaranteed delivery of user plane PDUs
between two NG-RAN nodes.

The protocol stack for Xn-U is shown in Figure 7.2-1.

![](./media/image4.emf)

Figure 7.2-1: Xn-U protocol structure

The user plane packets conveyed by GTP-U may be PDCP PDUs (e.g. in case
of dual connectivity), PDCP SDUs (e.g. in case of DRB level data
forwarding), or SDAP SDUs (e.g. in PDU Session level data forwarding).

User plane protocol messages (as defined in TS 38.425 \[7\] and
TS 38.415 \[10\]) are carried by container fields in the GTP-U extension
header as specified in TS 29.281 \[11\]. A single GTP-U packet may carry
a user plane packet and/or a user plane protocol message. The mapping
between container fields and Xn user plane protocol procedures and
functions is described in Table 7.2-1.
