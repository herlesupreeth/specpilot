Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR repeater *type 1-C*. These have been
derived from, and are consistent with the conducted requirements for
*repeater type 1-C* in NR repeater specification defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\].

A *repeater type 1-C* only has conducted requirements so it requires
compliance to this specification only.

*Arepeater type 2-O* has only radiated requirements so it requires
compliance to TS 38.115-2 \[3\] only.

4 General conducted test conditions and declarations
====================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1
of this specification, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1. The
frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of
TS 38.106 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.106 \[2\]. Test Tolerances
for the conducted test requirements explicitly stated in the present
document are given in annex C of the present document.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545
\[11\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this
may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure
that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1.2 had
been used.

4.2 Conducted requirement reference points
------------------------------------------

For *repeater type 1-C*, the requirements are applied at the repeater
*antenna connector* (BS-side connector or UE-side connector) for
downlink or uplink for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

![](./media/image4.png)

Figure 4.2-1: *Repeater type 1-C* downlink and uplink interface

4.3 Repeater classes
--------------------

### 4.3.1 Repeater class for downlink

The requirements in this specification apply to downlink Wide Area
repeaters, downlink Medium Range repeaters and downlink Local Area
repeaters unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios
for each class are exactly the same for repeater with and without
connectors.

For *repeater type 1-C*, repeater downlink classes are defined as
indicated below:

\- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m.

### 4.3.2 Repeater class for uplink

The requirements in this specification apply to uplink Wide Area
repeaters and uplink Local Area repeaters unless otherwise stated. The
associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the same for
repeater with and without connectors.

For *repeater type 1-C*, repeater uplink classes are defined as
indicated below:

\- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

\- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

4.5 Repeater configurations
---------------------------

### 4.5.1 General configurations

For *repeater type 1-C*, the requirements are applied at the repeater
*antenna connector* (BS-side connector or UE-side connector) for
downlink or uplink for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

![](./media/image5.png)

Figure 4.5.1-1: *Repeater type 1-C* test ports

### 4.5.2 Transmission with multiple BS-side antenna connectors

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each BS-side *antenna connector*
in the case of transmission with multiple BS-side *antenna connectors*.

Requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the remaining
*antenna connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the antenna connectors to be equivalent (D.13), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the BS-side *antenna
connectors*.

### 4.5.3 Transmission with multiple UE-side antenna connectors

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each UE-side *antenna connector*
in the case of transmission with multiple UE-side *antenna connectors*.

Requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the remaining
*antenna connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the antenna connectors to be equivalent (D.13), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the UE-side *antenna
connectors*.

### 4.5.4 Duplexers

The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer
fitted, if a duplexer is supplied as part of the repeater. If the
duplexer is supplied as an option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests
should be repeated with and without the duplexer fitted to verify that
the repeater meets the requirements of the present document in both
cases.

The following tests shall be performed with the duplexer fitted, and
without it fitted if this is an option:

1\) clause 6.2, repeater output power, for the highest static power step
only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;

2\) clause 6.4, out of band gain; outside the repeater downlink or
uplink band;

3\) clause 6.5, unwanted emissions; outside the repeater downlink or
uplink band;

4\) clause 6.7, output intermodulation; for the testing of conformance,
the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize intermodulation
products from the transmitters falling in receive channels.

5\) clause 6.9, Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio; outside the repeater
downlink or uplink band.

The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer
fitted.

NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is
important to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not
affect the test apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of
attenuators, isolators and filters.

NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be
generated, not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The
intermodulation products generated in the antenna system are not
controlled by 3GPP specifications, and may degrade during operation
(e.g. due to moisture ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued
satisfactory operation of a repeater, an operator will normally select
NR-ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive
channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator may specify
the NR-ARFCNs to be used.

### 4.5.5 Power supply options

If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.5.6 Ancillary RF amplifiers

The *repeater type 1-C* requirements of the present document shall be
met with the ancillary RF amplifier fitted. At tests, the ancillary
amplifier is connected to the repeater by a connecting network
(including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary
amplifier and the repeater. The applicable connecting network loss range
is declared by the manufacturer (D.14). Other characteristics and the
temperature dependence of the attenuation of the connecting network are
neglected. The actual attenuation value of the connecting network is
chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme values. The lowest
value is used unless otherwise stated.

Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted
and, if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify
that the repeater meets the requirements of the present document in both
cases.

When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where \"x\"
denotes that the test is applicable:

Table 4.5.6-1: Tests applicable to ancillary RF amplifiers

  Clause   Ancillary RF amplifier needed
  -------- -------------------------------
  6.2      x
  6.4      x
  6.5      x
  6.7      x
  6.8      x
  6.9      x

In repeater output power test (clause 6.2) highest applicable
attenuation value is applied.

### 4.5.7 Combining of repeaters

If the repeater is intended for combination with additional apparatus
connected to a repeater port and this combination is supplied as a
system, the combination of repeater together with the additional
apparatus shall also fulfil the repeater requirements. E.g. if the
repeater is intended for combination such that multiple repeaters
amplify the same signals into the same ports the combination shall also
fulfil the repeater requirements.

An example of such a configuration is shown in figure 4.5.7-1.

Figure 4.5.7-1: Example of repeater configuration

4.6 Manufacturer declarations
-----------------------------

The following repeater declarations listed in table 4.6-1, when
applicable to the repeater under test, are required to be provided by
the manufacturer for the conducted requirements testing of the *repeater
type 1-C*. Declarations can be made independently for UL and DL.

4.7 Test configurations
-----------------------

### 4.7.1 General

Test configurations in this specification refer to the configuration of
test signals from test equipment that are provided to the repeater
input.

The test configurations shall be constructed using the methods defined
below, subject to the parameters declared by the manufacturer for the
supported RF configurations as listed in clause 4.6. The test
configurations to use for conformance testing are defined for each
supported RF configuration in clauses 4.8.3 and 4.8.4.

The applicable test models for generation of the carrier transmit test
signal are defined in clause 4.9.

NOTE: If required, carriers are shifted to align with the channel
raster.

### 4.7.2 Test signal used to build Test Configurations

The signal\'s channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing used to build NR
Test Configurations shall be selected according to table 4.7.2-1.

### 4.7.3 RTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of test configuration RTC1 is to test all repeater
requirements that need an input signal in the *passband* when there is
only one *passband* per *operating band*.

#### 4.7.3.1 RTC1 generation

RTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

> \- Declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth supported shall be used
> (D.18);

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower *passband* edge. If the width of the *passband* is
at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to be tested then place a
second signal adjacent to the upper *passband* edge. Otherwise
reposition the carrier to be tested according to the single carrier test
frequencies described in section 4.9.1.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis using the same *antenna connector*. All configured component
carriers are transmitted simultaneously in the tests where the repeater
should be ON.

#### 4.7.3.2 RTC1 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the expected input power to the
repeater for the test (i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB)
according to the manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.5 RTC2: Non-contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of RTC2 is to test all repeater requirements that need an
input signal in the *passband* when there is more than one *passband*
per *operating band*.

#### 4.7.5.1 RTC2 generation

RTC2 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The repeater *passband* bandwidths shall be the declared maximum
repeater RF Bandwidth supported for multiple passbands (D.18). The
repeater RF Bandwidth consists of one sub-block gap and the two highest
and lowest declared *passbands* .

\- For each *passband*, select the carrier to be tested according to
4.7.2. If the the width of the *passband* is at least twice that of the
carrier to be tested then place a carrier adjacent to the upper
*passband* edge and another carrier (as described in 4.7.2) adjacent to
the lower *passband* edge. Otherwise, tests shall be applied with one
carrier adjacent to the lower sub-block edge and one carrier adjacent to
the upper sub-block edge for each sub-block gap.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

#### 4.7.5.2 RTC2 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the
test (i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.6 RTC3: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

The purpose of RTC3 is to test multi-band operation aspects.

#### 4.7.6.1 RTC3 generation

RTC3 is based on re-using the previously specified test configurations
applicable per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed
using the following method:

\- The repeater RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall be
the declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation
(D.19).

\- The number of carriers of each supported *operating band* shall be
sufficient to fill all of the *passbands* with one or two carriers
(depending on the passband bandwidth). Carriers shall be selected
according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the outermost edges of
the declared repeater Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be
placed at the repeater RF Bandwidths edges, if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to RTC1, where the
declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. The mirror
image of the single-band test configuration shall be used in each
alternate band(s) and in the highest band.

\- If the bandwidth of any *passband* is insufficient to accommodate two
carriers then tests shall be repeated with the test carriers positioned
such that there is a carrier adjacent to the lower edge of a sub-block
gap or inter-band gap and a carrier adjacent to the upper edge of the
sub-block gap or inter-band gap, for each sub-block gap or inter-block
gap.

#### 4.7.6.2 RTC3 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same level so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the test
(i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.7 RTC4: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier

The purpose of RTC4 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
higher PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and non-contiguous
operation (if supported) in multi-band mode.

#### 4.7.7.1 RTC4 generation

RTC4 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable per
band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The repeater RF Bandwidth of each supported *operating band* shall be
the declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation
(D.19).

\- The allocated repeater RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall be selected according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth for outermost
bands and at the Repeater RF Bandwidths edges for middle band(s) if any.
Additional carriers shall next be placed at the Repeater RF Bandwidths
edges, if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to RTC3, where the
declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest
supported NR channel bandwidth and smallest subcarrier spacing shall be
used in the test configuration.

\- If only one carrier can be placed for the concerned band(s), the
carrier(s) shall be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum radio bandwidth for outermost band(s) and at one of the
outermost edges of the supported frequency range within the Base Station
RF Bandwidths for middle band(s) if any.

#### 4.7.7.2 RTC4 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same level so that the sum of the carrier powers
equals the expected input power to the repeater for the test (i.e.,
either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

4.8 Applicability of requirements
---------------------------------

### 4.8.1 General

### 4.8.2 Applicability of test configurations for single-band operation

The applicable test configurations are specified in the tables below for
each the supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according
to clause 4.6. The generation and power allocation for each test
configuration is defined in clause 4.7. This clause contains the test
configurations for a repeater capable of single carrier, and/or
multi-carrier operation in both contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
in single band.

For a repeater declared to support a single *passband* within a single
band (D.2), the test configurations in the second column of table
4.8.3-1 shall be used for testing.

For a repeater declared to support more than one *passband* within a
single band (D.2) and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s
declaration according to clause 4.6 are identical for all passbands, the
test configurations in the third column of table 4.8.3-1 shall be used
for testing.

For a repeater declared to support more than one *passband* within a
single band (D.2) and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s
declaration according to clause 4.6 are not identical for all passbands,
the test configurations in the fourth column of table 4.8.3-1 shall be
used for testing.

### 4.8.4 Applicability of test configurations for *multi-band* operation

For a repeater declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the test
configuration in table 4.8.4-1 and/or table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for
testing. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on common
*multi-band connector*, the test configuration in the second column of
table 4.8.4-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped
on common *single-band connector*, the test configuration in table
4.8.3-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector*, the test
configuration in the third column of table 4.8.4-1 shall be used.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single passband testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the repeater. These are denoted as RF
channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
passband at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum repeater RF
Bandwidth located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~
(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

For repeater capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated,
the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~: the *repeater RF Bandwidths* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and
at the highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
Maximum Radio Bandwidth, in the highest operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the *repeater RF Bandwidths* located at the top
of the supported frequency range in the highest operating band and at
the lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum
Radio Bandwidth, in the lowest operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands.
B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *repeater RF Bandwidths* are located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and
at the top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single passband, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation, the position of B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in
the supported operating band combinations shall be specified by the
laboratory. The laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer
or other bodies.

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a repeater operates can either be contiguous
or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the
present specification apply for repeater configured for both contiguous
spectrum operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For repeater operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements
apply both at the repeater *passband* edges and inside the sub-block
gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the repeater *passband* edges and the sub-block edges
respectively.

4.11 Requirements for repeater capable of multi-band operation
--------------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band connector* the conducted test requirements in clause 6
and 7 apply separately to each supported *operating band* unless
otherwise stated. For some conducted test requirements, it is explicitly
stated that specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at
*multi-band connector(s)* as detailed in the requirement clause. For
repeater capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transceivers in downlink and transceivers in
uplink implementations (multi-band or single band) with mapping of
transceivers to one or more *antenna* *connectors* for *repeater type
1-C* in different ways are possible. For *multi-band connector(s)* the
exclusions or provisions for multi-band apply. For *single-band
connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, output intermodulation, ACRR and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the repeater is configured for single-band operation, *single-band
requirements* shall apply to this connector configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable
repeater are applicable. *Single-band requirements* are tested
separately at the connector configured for single-band operation, with
all other connectors terminated.

For *multi-band connectors* supporting the bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur between the bands.

NOTE 1: The conducted test requirements for multi-band connectors
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present
release of this specification.

4.12 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

**X Title**

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

**X.1 Definition and applicability**

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

**X.2 Minimum requirement**

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.

**X.3 Test purpose**

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

**X.4 Method of test**

**X.4.1 General**

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

**X.4.2y First test method**

**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up.

**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like domain (e.g.
frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms
(e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g.
average result from several measurement positions).

**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

**X.5 Test requirement**

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 (Interpretation of measurement results). Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the NR operation in NR operating bands specification, their channel
bandwidth configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as
synchronization raster specification, refer to TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 5
and its relevant clauses.

For the conducted testing purposes in this specification, only FR1
operating bands are considered.

6 Conducted characteristics
===========================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at the *antenna connector* for *repeater type 1-C*
configuration in normal operating conditions.

Requirements apply in both DL and UL.

For the DL the *antenna connector* on the BS side is the input and the
*antenna connector* on the UE side is the output.

For the UL the *antenna connector* on the UE side is the input and the
*antenna connector* on the BS side is the output.

General test conditions for conducted tests of the *repeater type 1-C*
are given in clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results
and configurations for testing. Repeater configurations for the tests
are defined in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors* have
been declared equivalent (D.13), only a representative one is necessary
to be tested to demonstrate conformance.

6.2 Repeater output power
-------------------------

### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The output power limit for the respective repeater classes in tables
6.2.1-1 and 6.2.1-2 shall be compared to the rated output power and the
declared repeater class. It is not subject to testing.

### 6.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *passband*.

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is defined for normal
and extreme conditions in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.2.2.

### 6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the repeater output power accuracy of
the *rated passband output power* across the frequency range and under

6.5 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[4\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *channel
bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as
harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and
frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the Repeater transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* of *repeater type 1-C* DL and uplink *operating band*
of *repeater type 1-C* UL, plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and
Δf~OBUE~ below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency
range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in tables 6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.5.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band of repeater type 1-C DL*

  Repeater type       *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  Repeater type 1-C   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 200 MHz            10
                      200 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

Table 6.5.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink *operating band
of repeater 1-C UL*

  Repeater type       *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  Repeater type 1-C   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 200 MHz            10
                      200 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

### 6.5.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *repeater type 1-C passband*
whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or
multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

For a *repeater* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.5.2.5 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.5-3 or 6.5.2.5-3a, while
the CACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.5 shall apply in *gaps between
passbands* for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.5-4 or
6.5.2.5-4a.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.5
shall apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.5.2.5-3 or 6.5.2.5-3a, while the CACLR requirement in clause
6.5.2.5 shall apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.5.2.5-4 or 6.5.2.5-4a.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.5.2.2.

#### 6.5.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement
shall be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.3. All connectors not
under test shall be terminated.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

> \- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.5.2.5.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.

2\) Set the input signal to the representative connectors under test
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.7 using the
corresponding test models RDL-FR1-TM1.1 and RUL-FR1-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum rated
output power, P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB.

3\) Measure ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of the passband
edge as specified in clause 6.5.2.5. In multiple carrier case only
offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.

4\) For the ACLR requirement applied inside *gap between passbands*, or
inside *Inter passband gap* for multi-band operation:

a\) Measure ACLR inside *gap between passbands* or *Inter passband gap*
as specified in clause 6.5.2.5, if applicable.

b\) Measure CACLR inside *gap between passbands* or *Inter passband gap*
as specified in clause 6.5.2.5, if applicable.

5\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to RDL-FR1-TM1.2
for DL and RUL-FR1-TM1.2 for UL in clause 4.9.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.5.2.5 Test requirements

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in table 6.5.2.5‑1 for
*repeater type 1-C* for DL and UL for Wide Area class.

For *repeater type 1-C* for DL and for UL for WA class, the ACLR (CACLR)
absolute limits in table 6.5.2.5-2, 6.5.2.5-5 or the ACLR (CACLR)
*limits* in table 6.5.2.5-1, 6.5.2.5-3 or 6.5.2.5-4, whichever is less
stringent, shall apply for each *antenna connector*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be
applied to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna
connectors* for *repeater type 1-C*.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a *gap
between passband* or the *inter-passband gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
between passband* or the *inter-passband gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *repeater type 1-C passband edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table6.5.2.5-4 and 6.5.2.5-4a and the filters on the assigned channels
are defined in table 6.5.2.5-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for *repeater type 1-C* for DL and for UL for WA class for NR carriers
located on either side of the *gap between passband* or the
*inter-passband gap* shall be higher than the value specified in table
6.5.2.5-4.

### 6.5.3 Operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for *repeater type 1-C* DL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑1
for the NR *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for *repeater type 1-C* UL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑2 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for *repeater type 1-C* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *gap
between passband*. In addition, for a *repeater type 1-C* operating in
multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any *inter-passband*
*gap*.

*Limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band of repeater type 1-C DL and uplink operating
band of repeater type 1-C UL*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in tables
6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any ***inter-passband** gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined minimum requirement shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the minimum requirement specified at the
*repeater type 1-C passband edges* on each side of the
***inter-passband** gap*.

\- ∆f is the separation between the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation from the *repeater type 1-C passband
edge* frequency to the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *inter-passband gap* minus half of the
bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector of repeater type 1-C DL*, the operating band
unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are
carrier(s) transmitted in another supported downlink *operating band*.
In this case, no cumulative minimum requirement is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating band* with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission minimum requirement of the band
where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the
present clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirement of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined
in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset
(∆f~max~), shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up
to Δf~OBUE~ MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink
*operating band* without any carrier transmitted.

For a *multi-band connector of repeater type 1-C UL*, the operating band
unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported uplink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are
carrier(s) transmitted in another supported uplink *operating band*. In
this case, no cumulative minimum requirement is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported uplink *operating band* with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the inter-band gap between a supported uplink operating band
with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\* Δf~OBUE~, f\_offsetmax
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported uplink operating bands and the operating band
unwanted emission minimum requirement of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause,
shall apply across both uplink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirements of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as
defined in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency
offset (∆fmax), shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest
frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz above the highest frequency of the
supported uplink operating band without any carrier transmitted.

In addition, inside any *gap between passband* for a *single-band
connector* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined minimum
requirement shall be applied which is the cumulative sum of the minimum
requirement specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the
*gap between passband*.

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passband* bandwidth minus
half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.5.3.2

#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors
not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

Detection mode: True RMS.

2\) Set the input signal to the representative connectors under test
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models NR-FR1‑TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input
power intended to produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,AC~ +
10dB.

3\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For connector under test
declared to operate in multiple bands or non-contiguous spectrum, the
emission within the *Inter passband Bandwidth* or *sub-block gap* shall
be measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest
RF Bandwidth or sub block edge.

4\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases, with the channel
set-up according to NR-FR1-TM 1.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

##### 6.5.3.5.5 Minimum requirements for additional requirements

##### 6.5.3.5.5.1 Limits in FCC Title 47 {#limits-in-fcc-title-47 .H6}

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.5.3.5.1, 6.5.3.5.2,
6.5.3.5.3 and 6.5.3.5.4, the *repeater type 1-C* may have to comply with
the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[13\], when
deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer.

##### 6.5.3.5.5.2 Protection of DTT {#protection-of-dtt .H6}

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *repeater type 1-C* operating in Band n20, the level of
emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth
on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table 6.5.3.5.5.2-1, a
minimum requirements P~EM,N~ is declared by the manufacturer. This
requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part
of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Table 6.5.3.5.5.2-1: Declared emissions *minimum requirement* for
protection of DTT

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Filter centre frequency, F~filter~   *Measurement bandwidth*   Declared emission *minimum requirement* (dBm)
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  F~filter~ = 8\*N + 306 (MHz);\       8 MHz                     P~EM,N~
  21 ≤ N ≤ 60                                                    

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
emissions at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including
antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides
the characteristics of the repeater needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be
determined using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[5\], annex E.

### 6.5.4 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

For *repeater type 1-C*, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall
apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding

\- the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each
supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, where the
Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1 for downlink, or

\- the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of each
supported uplink operating band, up to ΔfOBUE above the highest
frequency of each supported uplink operating band, where the ΔfOBUE is
defined in table 6.5.1-2 for uplink

. For some *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz
in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink
*operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[4\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *Repeater type 1-C* shall
not exceed the *minimum requirements* defined in clause 6.5.4.5.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.5.4.2.

#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors
not under test shall be terminated.

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.5.4.5.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

3\) Set the input signal to the representative connectors under test
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models NR-FR1‑TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input
power intended to produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,AC~ +
10dB.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.5.4.5 Test requirements

##### 6.5.4.5.1 General transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *minimum requirements* of either table 6.5.4.5.1-1, table
6.5.4.5.1-2 (Category A limits) or table 6.5.4.5.1-3 (Category B limits)
shall apply. The application of either Category A or Category B limits
shall be the same as for operating band unwanted emissions in clause
6.5.3.

##### 6.5.4.5.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR *operating band*. It is
in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement
is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies,
since this is set by local or regional regulation.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *minimum requirements* are provided in table
6.5.4.5.2-1 where requirements for co-existence with the system listed
in the first column apply for *repeater type 1-C*. For a *multi-band

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[14\], is defined in terms
of EIRP, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the
*antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.

The following requirement shall be applied to repeater operating in Band
n26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to
800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at
the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.

##### 6.5.4.5.3 Co-location with base stations and *repeater type 1-C* Nodes

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS,
IAB-DU, IAB-MT and *repeater type 1-C* receivers when GSM900, DCS1800,
PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU,
IAB-MT, or *repeater type 1-C* are co-located with *repeater type 1-C*.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with same class.

The *minimum requirements* are in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 for a *repeater type
1-C*. Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first
column apply, depending on the declared *repeater type 1-C* class. For a
*multi-band connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column
of table 6.5.4.5.3-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit
frequency range of a *repeater type 1-C*. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[15\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.5.4.5.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a
case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

### 6.5.5 Receiver spurious emissions

#### 6.5.5.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector*. The requirements only apply to *repeater type 1-C* for TDD
operation.

For each a*ntenna connectors* on BS-side and UE-side supporting both RX
and TX in TDD, the requirements apply during the *transmitter OFF
state*. For *antenna connectors* both BS-side and UE-side in FDD, the RX
spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX spurious
emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.5.4.5.

For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF state*, and are subject to exclusion zones
in each supported *operating band*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of receiver spurious
emissions requirements over all *antenna connectors* for *repeater type
1-C* shall not exceed *minimum requirements* defined in clause 6.5.5.5.

#### 6.5.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.5.5.2.

#### 6.5.5.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to limit the
interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.

#### 6.5.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test,

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.9.

2\) Ensure the transmitter is OFF.

3\) Set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in table
6.5.5.5-1.

4\) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described
in table 6.5.5.5-1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.5.5.5 Test requirements

The receiver spurious emissions requirements for *repeater type 1-C* are
that for each *antenna connector,* the power of emissions shall not
exceed the value specified in table 6.5.5.5-1.

6.6 Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
-----------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of repeater and the measured
signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the equalization by
the measurement equipment. This difference is called the error vector.
Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as
specified in TS 38.104 Annex B for FR1. The repeater EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed in percent. The accuracy of the
input symbols is counted in the measurement uncertainty.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.1.1-1.

### 6.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference
between the reference waveform provided at the input of the repeater and
the measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is
called the error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is
determined are the same as specified in TS 38.101-1\[9\] Annex F. Before
calculating the repeater EVM the measured waveform is corrected by the
sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage
shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the
repeater EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the repeater EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement
specified in TS 38.101-1\[9\] clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms,
the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as
the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean
reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the repeater
EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square root of the
ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed as a %. The accuracy of the input waveform is counted in the
measurement uncertainty.

The basic repeater EVM measurement interval in one slot in the time
domain. The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols
that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval,
as defined in TS 38.101-1 \[9\] clause 6.3.3 for EVM for UE.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.2.1-1.

6.7 Input intermodulation
-------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

#### 6.7.1.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the passband, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the passband.

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
Repeater to maintain the wanted frequency free of internally created
interference.

The measurements shall apply to both uplink and downlink paths of the
Repeater, during the *transmitter ON state* at maximum gain.

#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\] clauses 6.7.1.2, 6.7.2.2
and 6.7.3.2.

#### 6.7.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified by the minimum
requirements.

#### 6.7.1.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A.2

A measurement system set-up is shown in Annex D.

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.

3\) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the Repeater.

##### 6.7.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the
passband, so that one carrier, f~1~, is 1 MHz outside the channel edge
frequency of the first or last channel in the passband, and the lowest
order intermodulation product from the two carriers is positioned in the
centre of the passband.

2\) Measure the increase in output power in the passband when the
interferer is applied.

3\) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the Repeater.

#### 6.7.1.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.1.5.1 General requirement

The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals
are applied to the NR Repeater:

Table 6.7.1.5.1-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  1,0 MHz       -40 dBm                     2 CW carriers     1 MHz

f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first
or last channel in the passband of the closer carrier.

For the parameters specified in Table 6.7.1.5.1-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase by more than \[10+TT\] dB at the output of the
Repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

##### 6.7.1.5.2 Co-location with BS/Repeater in other systems 

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of NR repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS
or repeater operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
a NR repeater.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater. If
the BS side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the downlink. If
the UE side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the uplink.

Table 6.7.1.5.2-1: input intermodulation requirement for NR repeater DL
when co-located with BS/repeater in other frequency bands.

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and
6.7.1.5.2-2 do not apply when the Repeaters passband frequency range is
adjacent to the frequency range of the co-location requirement in the
Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 or Table 6.7.1.5.2-2. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[15\].

NOTE 2: The Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and Table 6.7.1.5.2-2 assumes that two
operating bands, where the corresponding BS or Repeater transmit and
receive frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

For the parameters specified in table Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and 6.7.1.5.2-2,
the power in the passband shall not increase with more than \[10 + TT\]
dB B at the output of the repeater as measured in the centre of the
passband, compared to the level obtained without interfering signals
applied.

##### 6.7.1.5.3 Co-existence with other systems

This input intermodulation existence requirement may be applied for the
protection of NR repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS
or repeater operating in another frequency band co-exist with a NR
repeater.

The intermodulation performance should be met when the signals in Table
6.7.1.5.3-1 are applied to the Repeater:

NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 6.7.1.5.3-1 do not apply
when the repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the
frequency range of the co-existence requirement in the
Table 6.7.1.5.3-1. The current state-of-the-art technology does not
allow a single generic solution for co-existence.

NOTE 2: The Table 6.7.1.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where
the frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

For the parameters specified in Table 6.7.1.5.3-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase with more than \[10 + TT\] dB at the output of
the repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

6.8 Output intermodulation
--------------------------

### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability

#### 6.8.1.1 General

The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the repeater to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering
signal reaching the repeater via the output port. The requirement shall
apply during the *transmitter ON state*and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater.

For *repeater type 1-C*, the output intermodulation level is the power
of the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected
into the *antenna connector*.

#### 6.8.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\] clause 6.8.2.

#### 6.8.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject
signal on the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal
applied at the repeater output port.

#### 6.8.1.4 Method of test

##### 6.8.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A.2

A measurement system set-up is shown in Annex D.

1\) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater (wanted
signal). Connect a signal generator to the output port (interfering
signal) and make sure the signal generator power is directed to the
repeater output port.

> 2\) Detection mode: True RMS.

##### 6.8.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (wanted signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model R-FR1-TM1.1, with a
bandwidth as defined in Table 6.8.1.5.1-1, at the level which produce
the manufacturer specified maximum output power at maximum gain.

3\) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference
signal) to generate a signal in accordance to test model R-FR1-TM1.1,
with a bandwidth, level and frequency offset as defined in Table
6.8.1.5.1-1.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth as described in the test requirements and note
that the measured value does not exceed the specified value.
Measurements in the band of the interfering signal shall be excluded.
The measurements can be limited to the power of all third and fifth
order intermodulation products.

5\) Repeat the test from step 3 on until all interfering signal centre
frequency offsets in Table 6.8.1.5.1-1 has been tested, but exclude
interfering signal frequencies that are outside of the allocated
frequency band for NR downlink.

6\) For repeater supporting Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, repeat
the test using wanted and interfering signal parameters as defined in
Table 6.8.1.5.2-1.

NOTE: As a general rule the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 6.8.1.5 Test requirements

##### 6.8.1.5.1 General requirements

Test requirement shall be met using interfering and wanted signal
parameters according to Table 6.8.1.5.1-1

6.9 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
-------------------------------------------

### 6.9.1 Definitions and applicability

Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average gain
over a carrier of the repeater in the *passband* to the average gain of
the repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater *passband*.
The carrier in the *passband* and in the adjacent channel shall be of
the same type (reference carrier) with bandwidths as defined by *nominal
channel bandwidth*. In case of Local Area repeater above 2496 MHz, the
channel within the *passband* and the adjacent channel are assumed to
have a bandwidth of 10 MHz

The requirement is differentiated between uplink and downlink.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

### 6.9.2 Co-existence with UTRA, E-UTRA and NR

This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA, E-UTRA and
NR signals in geographic areas in which NR Repeater, NR BS, E-UTRA BS
and UTRA BS are deployed so that they serve adjacent channels. The
reference carrier is a NR carrier.

#### 6.9.2.1 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\] sub-clause 6.9.2.

#### 6.9.2.2 Test purpose

To verify that the Repeater ACRR requirement is met as specified in
sub-clause 6.9.2.1.

#### 6.9.2.3 Method of test

##### 6.9.2.3.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2. \[RF channels to be updated\]

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, T; see clause 4.9.1.

*Repeater RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.9.2.3.2 Procedure

1\) Set the signal generator to transmit a signal modulated with test
model XX for downlink and test model XX for uplink as defined in section
4.9 at the first or last channel with channel offset from frequency
range of passband defined in section 6.9.2.3.3 within the pass band.

2\) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain

3\) Measure the RRC filtered mean power at the RF output port over a
certain slot.

4\) Set the signal generator to transmit the same signal and the same
input power at one of the channel offsets outside the repeater pass band
according to Tables in section 6.9.2.3.3.

5\) Measure the filtered mean power at the RF output port over a certain
slot.

6\) Calculate the ratio of the measured power in the pass band to the
measured power at the channel offset.

7\) Repeat step 4) to 6) until all channel offsets in Tables in section
6.9.2.3.3 are measured.

##### 6.9.2.3.3 Test Requirements

For a repeater operating at *passband* below 2496 MHz, the ACRR
requirements in table 6.9.2.3.3-1 shall apply in downlink. In normal
conditions the ACRR for downlink shall be higher than the value
specified in the Table 6.9.2.3.3-1.

6.10 Transmit ON/OFF power
--------------------------

### 6.10.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.10.1.1 Definition and applicability

Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the
repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of the
repeater.

Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the *passband
bandwidth* of the repeater (BW~passband~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF state*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz of the input signal.

For *multi-band connectors* and for *single band connectors* supporting
transmission in multiple *operating bands*, the requirement is only
applicable during the *transmitter OFF state* in all supported
*operating bands*.

#### 6.10.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.10.1.2.

#### 6.10.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter OFF power is
within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.10.1.4 Method of test

Requirement is tested together with transmitter transient period, as
described in clause 6.10.2.4.

#### 6.10.1.5 Test requirements

The conformance testing of transmit OFF power is included in the
conformance testing of transmitter transient period; therefore, see
clause 6.10.2.5 for test requirements.

### 6.10.2 Transmitter transient period

#### 6.10.2.1 Definition and applicability

*Transmitter transient period* requirements apply only to TDD operation
of the repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of
the repeater.

The *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the *transmitter OFF state* to the
*transmitter ON state* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient period*
is illustrated in figure 6.10.2.1-1.

Figure 6.10.2.1-1: Example of relations between transmitter *ON state*,
transmitter *OFF state* and *transmitter transient period*

For *repeater type 1-C* this requirement shall be applied at the
*antenna connector* supporting transmission in the *operating ban*d.

For a repeater that is not declared to be a long delay repeater (D.15),
the beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced
to the slot timing at the input.

For a repeater that is declared to be a long delay repeater (D.15), the
beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced to
the slot timing at the input plus the declared repeater delay.

#### 6.10.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.10.2.2.

#### 6.10.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter transient periods
are within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.10.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.10.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.10.2.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *antenna connectors*, they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *antenna connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *antenna connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *antenna connector* for input and output signals to
measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All *antenna connectors*
not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

2\) Set the input signal to the representative connectors under test
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to
produce the maximum rated output power, P~rated,in,\ AC~ + 10dB.

3\) Measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the *antenna
connector* centred on the central frequency of the RF bandwidth. 70/N μs
average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end of one transmitter
ON state + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next transmitter ON state --
10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

In addition, for *multi-band connector(s)*, the following steps shall
apply:

4\) For *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

6.10.2.5 Test requirements

For *repeater type 1-C downlink*, the requirements for transmitter OFF
power spectral density shall be less than -83 dBm/MHz per *antenna
connector* for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz.

For *repeater type 1-C downlink*, the requirements for transmitter OFF
power spectral density shall be less than -82.5 dBm/MHz per *antenna
connector* for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \< f ≤ 6.0 GHz.

For *repeater type 1-C uplink*, the requirements for transmitter OFF
power spectral density shall be less than -48dBm /
(SCS\*(12\*N~RB~+1)/1000) MHz per *antenna connector,* where SCS is Sub
Carrier Spacing in kHz for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz.

For *repeater type 1-C uplink*, the requirements for transmitter OFF
power spectral density shall be less than -47.5dBm /
(SCS\*(12\*N~RB~+1)/1000) MHz per *antenna connector,* where SCS is Sub
Carrier Spacing in kHz for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \< f ≤ 6.0 GHz.

For *multi-band connector*, the requirement is only applicable during
the transmitter OFF state in all supported operating bands.

  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[16\];

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[17\];

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[18\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.1 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[19\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[20\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[21\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[19\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[20\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[19\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[20\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the repeater test environments defined in
annex B shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex E (normative): In-channel TX tests

E.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the repeater under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

E.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the repeater under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal
signal, that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an
ideal error free received signal. All signals are represented as
equivalent (generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a FDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 30 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz
(*N*~RB~ = 273). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

E.2.1 Output signal of the repeater under test
----------------------------------------------

The output signal of the repeater under test is acquired by the
measuring equipment and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at
a sampling rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and
it is named ![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png). The *FFT
size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table 6.6.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS in \[6\]. In the time domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is
modelled as a signal with the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.6.3.5-3 in \[6\]. The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of
the *FFT size* and SCS.

E.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal ![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex E.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal ![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols
are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex E.2.1 in the time domain.

E.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency stability

\- EVM

E.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1 in figure F.2.4-1.
The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT size* + cyclic prefix
length) samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\" box.
The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from table
6.6.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table
6.6.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS in \[6\].

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.6.3.5-2, 6.6.3.5-3 and
6.6.3.5-4 in \[6\]. Table F.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol
number and the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for
those two symbols according to the sampling rate.

length for normal CP

  15          1                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 128
                                     (symbol 7, slot 0)                     

  30          2                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 64
                                     (symbol 0, slot 1)                     

  60          4                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 32
                                     (symbol 0, slot 2)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic
prefix than the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length =
352).

E.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in
![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png) are varied in order to
minimise the difference between
![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png) and
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png), after the amplitude
ratio of ![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png) and
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) has been scaled. Best
fit (minimum difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value
between ![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png) and
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) is an absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency stability.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency stability can
be derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples inbetween the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinuish between both.

After this process, the samples
![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png) are called
![](./media/image41.png)![](./media/image41.png).

E.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD,
there are ![](./media/image42.png)![](./media/image42.png) FFTs
performed where ![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of
symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called
![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png),

\- ![](./media/image45.png)![](./media/image45.png), and

\- ![](./media/image46.png)![](./media/image46.png).

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from tables 6.6.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.6.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS in
\[6\]and the transmission bandwidth.

The repeater shall transmit a signal according to the test models
intended for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal
signal shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as
follows, using ![](./media/image41.png)![](./media/image41.png) and
![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png):

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal
![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png), the timing is known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal ![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png) is
a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the ideal signal
![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png) and the data in the
measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of
more than one highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the
measured signal.

The number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to
![](./media/image41.png)![](./media/image41.png). This subset of samples
is called ![](./media/image47.png)![](./media/image47.png).

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre
![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png) is determined according
to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal CP, there
are two values for ![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png) in a
1 ms period:

\- ![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png) = length of cylic
prefix / 2,

\- ![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png) = Longer CP length -
length of cylic prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.6.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.6.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS in \[6\], and the longer CP length is obtained from table
F.2.4-1.

As per the example values:

\- ![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png) = 144 within the CP
of length 288 for OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,

\- ![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png) = 208= 352 - 144)
within the CP of length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.

E.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on ![](./media/image48.png)![](./media/image48.png) with the
FFT window timing ![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png). The
result is called ![](./media/image49.png)![](./media/image49.png). The
RE TX power (RETP) is then defined as:

![](./media/image50.png)

Where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

![](./media/image51.png)

Where the summation accumulates
![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png) RETP values of all
*N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not containing PDCCH, RS or
SSB within a slot.

From the acquired samples,
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) values for each OSTP
can be obtained and averaged where
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) is the number of slots
in a 10 ms measurement interval for FDD. For TDD,
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) is the number of slots
with downlink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval and is computed
according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1 in \[6\].

For the example used in the annex,
![](./media/image53.png)![](./media/image53.png) and
![](./media/image54.png)![](./media/image54.png).

E.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform![](./media/image42.png)![](./media/image42.png) FFTs on
![](./media/image48.png)![](./media/image48.png), one for each OFDM
symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing to
produce an array of samples,
![](./media/image42.png)![](./media/image42.png) in the time axis *t* by
*FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 280 FFTs are performed on
![](./media/image48.png)![](./media/image48.png). The result is an array
of samples, 280 in the time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image55.png)![](./media/image55.png) and
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png)are determined as
follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png)and the
post-FFT ideal signal ![](./media/image58.png)![](./media/image58.png)
for each demodulation reference signal, over 10 ms measurement interval.
This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image59.png)

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image60.png)![](./media/image60.png) an unwrap operation
must be performed according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
![](./media/image60.png)![](./media/image60.png) by adding multiples of
2 \* π when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances
![](./media/image61.png)![](./media/image61.png) are greater than or
equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

![](./media/image63.png)

> Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signals time-domain
> locations ![](./media/image61.png)![](./media/image61.png) from
> ![](./media/image49.png)![](./media/image49.png) for each demodulation
> reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image64.png)![](./media/image64.png) and
![](./media/image65.png)![](./media/image65.png) at the demodulation
reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving
average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged demodulation
reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window size is 19 and
averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when the number of
available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs
is smaller than the moving average window size, the window size is
reduced accordingly as per figure F.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image64.png)![](./media/image64.png) and
![](./media/image65.png)![](./media/image65.png) to compute
coefficients![](./media/image66.png)![](./media/image66.png),
![](./media/image67.png)![](./media/image67.png) for each subcarrier.

E.7 EVM
=======

E.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of
![](./media/image69.png)![](./media/image69.png), according to the
timing ![](./media/image70.png)![](./media/image70.png) and
![](./media/image71.png)![](./media/image71.png), using the equalizer
coefficients from F.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) (annex E.2.2) and are
called ![](./media/image72.png)![](./media/image72.png).

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

![](./media/image73.png)

Where:

\- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

\- ![](./media/image74.png)![](./media/image74.png) is the set of
subcarriers within the resource blocks with the considered modulation
scheme being active in symbol *t*,

\- ![](./media/image72.png)![](./media/image72.png) *is* the ideal
signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in accordance with
relevant test models,

\- ![](./media/image69.png)![](./media/image69.png) is the equalized
signal under test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

E.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
------------------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) slots where
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) is the number of slots
in a 10 ms measurement interval. The averaging in the time domain equals
the ![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) slot duration of
the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation step.

![](./media/image75.png)![](./media/image75.png)

*Where* ![](./media/image76.png)![](./media/image76.png) is the number
of resource blocks with the considered modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus ![](./media/image77.png)![](./media/image77.png) is calculated
using ![](./media/image78.png)![](./media/image78.png) in the
expressions above and ![](./media/image79.png)![](./media/image79.png)
is calculated using ![](./media/image80.png)![](./media/image80.png) in
the ![](./media/image81.png)![](./media/image81.png) calculation where
(*l* and *h*, low and high; where low is the timing
![](./media/image70.png)![](./media/image70.png) and high is the timing
![](./media/image71.png)![](./media/image71.png)).

Thus:

![](./media/image82.png)![](./media/image82.png)

The resulting ![](./media/image83.png)![](./media/image83.png) is
compared against the limit.

E.7.2 Averaged EVM (TDD)
------------------------

Let ![](./media/image84.png)![](./media/image84.png) be the number of
slots with downlink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For
TDD, the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from
![](./media/image84.png)![](./media/image84.png) slots of different 10
ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum of
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) slots averaging length
where ![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) is the number of
slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

![](./media/image81.png)![](./media/image81.png) is derived by: Square
the EVM results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares,
divide the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

![](./media/image85.png)![](./media/image85.png)

*Where* ![](./media/image76.png)![](./media/image76.png) is the number
of resource blocks with the considered modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The ![](./media/image86.png)![](./media/image86.png) is calculated,
using the maximum of ![](./media/image81.png)![](./media/image81.png) at
the window *W* extremities. Thus
![](./media/image77.png)![](./media/image77.png) is calculated using
![](./media/image78.png)![](./media/image78.png) and
![](./media/image79.png)![](./media/image79.png) is calculated using
![](./media/image80.png)![](./media/image80.png) (*l* and *h*, low and
high; where low is the timing
![](./media/image70.png)![](./media/image70.png) and and high is the
timing ![](./media/image71.png)![](./media/image71.png)).

![](./media/image87.png)![](./media/image87.png)

In order to unite at least
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) slots, consider the
minimum integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where
![](./media/image88.png)![](./media/image88.png) is determined by.

![](./media/image89.png)![](./media/image89.png)

and ![](./media/image90.png)![](./media/image90.png) for 15 kHz SCS,
![](./media/image91.png)![](./media/image91.png) for 30 kHz SCS and
![](./media/image92.png)![](./media/image92.png) for 60 kHz SCS normal
CP.

Unite by RMS.

![](./media/image93.png)

The resulting ![](./media/image83.png)![](./media/image83.png) is
compared against the limit.
