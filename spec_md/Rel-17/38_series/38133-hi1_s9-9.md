9 Measurement Procedure
=======================

9.1 General measurement requirement
-----------------------------------

### 9.1.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements are
split in intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD,
inter-RAT E-UTRAN TDD, and L1-RSRP measurements requirements. These
measurements may be used by the NG-RAN. The measurement quantities are
defined in TS38.215 \[4\], the measurement model is defined in TS38.300
\[10\], TS37.340 \[17\] and measurement accuracies are specified in
clause 10. Control of measurement reporting is specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

In the requirements of clause 9, the exceptions for side conditions
apply as follows:

\- for the UE capable of CA but not configured with any SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.2.1 for UE supporting CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.3 for UE
supporting CA in FR2, respectively;

\- for the UE capable of CA and configured with at least one SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.2.2 for UE configured with CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.4 for
UE supporting CA in FR2, respectively;

\- for the UE capable of SUL but not configured with SUL, the applicable
exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B, clause B.3.4.1
for UE supporting SUL in FR1;

\- for the UE capable of SUL and configured with at least one SUL, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.4.2 for UE configured with SUL in FR1.

### 9.1.2 Measurement gap

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE does not support independent measurement gap
patterns for different frequency ranges as specified in Table 5.1-1 in
\[18, 19, 20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses
to apply the network must provide a single per-UE measurement gap
pattern for concurrent monitoring of all frequency layers.

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports independent measurement gap patterns
for different frequency ranges as specified in Table 5.1-1 in \[18, 19,
20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses to apply
the network must provide either per-FR measurement gap patterns for
frequency range where UE requires per-FR measurement gap for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of each frequency range
independently, or a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of all frequency ranges.

If the UE is configured via LPP \[34\] to measure PRS for any RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement and PRS-RSRPP measurement
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], in order for the requirements in clauses
9.9.2, 9.9.3, 9.9.4 and 9.9.6 to apply, the network must provide

\- a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent monitoring of
all positioning frequency layers and intra-frequency, inter-frequency
and/or inter-RAT frequency layers of all frequency ranges, or

\- if UE supports independent measurement gap patterns for different
frequency ranges for PRS measurement, i.e. supporting
*independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, per-FR measurement gap pattern for the
frequency range for concurrent monitoring of all positioning frequency
layers and intra-frequency, inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
frequency layers in the corresponding frequency range.

During the per-UE measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding E-UTRAN PCell, E-UTRAN SCell(s) and NR serving cells for
E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity except the reception of signals used for RRM
measurement(s) and the signals used for random access procedure
according to TS38.321 \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells for SA (with single carrier or CA
configured) except the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s),
PRS measurement(s) and the signals used for random access procedure
according to \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding PCell, SCell(s) and E-UTRAN serving cells for NR-E-UTRA
dual connectivity except the reception of signals used for RRM
measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and the signals used for random
access procedure according to \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells for NR-DC except the reception of signals
used for RRM measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and the signals used for
random access procedure according to \[7\].

During the per-FR measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding E-UTRAN PCell, E-UTRAN SCell(s) and NR serving cells in
the corresponding frequency range for E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity except
the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s) and the signals
used for random access procedure according to TS38.321 \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells in the corresponding frequency range for
SA (with single carrier or CA configured) except the reception of
signals used for RRM measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and the signals
used for random access procedure according to TS38.321 \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding PCell, SCell(s) and E-UTRAN serving cells in the
corresponding frequency range for NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity except the
reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and
the signals used for random access procedure according to TS38.321
\[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells in the corresponding frequency range for
NR-DC except the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s), PRS
measurement(s) and the signals used for random access procedure
according to TS38.321 \[7\].

UEs shall support the measurement gap patterns listed in Table 9.1.2-1
based on the applicability specified in table 9.1.2-2 and 9.1.2-3. UE
determines measurement gap timing based on gap offset configuration and
measurement gap timing advance configuration provided by higher layer
signalling as specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] and TS 36.331 \[16\].

In E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity mode,

\- if per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

In NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity mode,

\- if per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms and UE has NR serving cell in FR1, the measurement
gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the end of the latest NR
subframe occurring immediately before the configured measurement gap
among MCG serving cells subframes in FR1.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms and UE doesn't have NR serving cell in FR1, the
measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the end of
the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately before the configured
measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

In NR-NR dual connectivity mode,

\- If per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest MCG subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- If per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest MCG subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- If per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest SCG subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

T~MG~ is the MG timing advance value provided in *mgta* according to
TS38.331 \[2\].

In determining the measurement gap starting point, UE shall use the DL
timing of the latest E-UTRA or NR subframe occurring immediately before
the configured measurement gap among E-UTRA or NR serving cells.

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE configured with E-UTRA-NR dual
connectivity or NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity, when serving cells are in
E-UTRA and FR1, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2,

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
the measurement gap pattern configured by MN;

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to only
LTE/FR1 serving cell(s),

> \- UE fulfils the measurement requirements for FR1/LTE measurement
> objects based on the configured measurement gap pattern;
>
> \- UE fulfils the requirements for FR2 measurement objects based on
> effective MGRP=20ms;

For per-FR measurement gap capable configured with E-UTRA-NR dual
connectivity, NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity or NR-NR dual connectivity,
when serving cells are in E-UTRA, FR1 and FR2, or in E-UTRA and FR2, or
in FR1 and FR2, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA /FR1 and FR2,

> \- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
> E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
> requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
> the measurement gap pattern configured by MN.

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE in NR standalone operation (with
single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC configuration), for per-FR gap based
measurement, when there is no serving cell in a particular FR, where
measurement objects are configured, regardless if explicit per-FR
measurement gap is configured in this FR, the effective MGRP in this FR
is used to determine requirements;

\- 20 ms for FR2 NR measurements

\- 40 ms for FR1 NR measurements

\- 40 ms for LTE measurements

\- 40 ms for FR1+LTE measurements

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE in NR standalone operation (with
single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC configuration), when serving cells are
in FR1 or FR2, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA /FR1 and FR2,

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
the measurement gap pattern configured by MN;

If measurement gap is configured in one FR but measurement object is not
configured in the FR, the scheduling opportunity in the FR depends on
the configured measurement gap pattern.

For single carrier or CA with aligned frame boundaries,

For E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity (with NR single carrier, NR CA
configuration), if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20ms, 10ms, 6ms,
4ms and 3ms. And if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption time
on FR1 serving cells in SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) =
20ms, 10ms, 6ms, 4ms and 3ms, and total interruption time on FR2 serving
cells in SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20ms, 10ms, 5.5ms,
3.5ms and 1.5ms.

For NR standalone operation (with single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC
configuration), if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on a serving cell during MGL is defined when MGL(N) = 20ms, 10ms,
6ms, 5.5ms, 4ms, 3.5ms, 3ms, and 1.5ms. And if UE is capable of
per-FR-gap, total interruption time on FR1 serving cells during MGL is
defined only when MGL(N) = 20ms, 10ms, 6ms, 4ms, and 3ms, and total
interruption time on FR2 serving cells during MGL is defined only when
MGL(N) = 20ms, 10ms, 5.5ms, 3.5ms, and 1.5ms.

For NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity (with NR single carrier, NR CA
configuration), if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20ms, 10ms, 6ms,
4ms, and 3ms. And if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on FR1 serving cells in MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N)
= 20ms, 10ms, 6ms, 4ms, and 3ms, and total interruption time on FR2
serving cells in MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20ms,
10ms, 5.5ms, 3.5ms, and 1.5ms.

For CA with non-aligned frame boundaries,

\- The total interruption time on an SCC is the same as the case CA with
aligned frame boundaries, if no SCC slots are partially overlapped with
the measurement gap.

\- The total interruption time on an SCC will be additionally extended
by one SCC slot, if there exist SCC slots partially overlapped with the
measurement gap.

It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to conduct
transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when MGTA is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect
to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots
occurring immediately after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than
15kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15kHz, in the L
consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with the
same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after the slot
partially overlapped with measurement gap

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

Note: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

### 9.1.4 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria

#### 9.1.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in clause 9.1.4.2,
the UE shall meet all other performance requirements defined in clause 9
and clause 10. The requirements in this clause also apply for a UE in
EN-DC with PSCell on a carrier frequency with CCA or SA NR with PCell on
a carrier frequency with CCA.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Each measurement identity
corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic reporting, or no
reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each measurement identity
is associated with an event triggering criterion. In case of periodic
reporting, a measurement identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.

#### 9.1.4.2 Requirements

In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in
the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion
(in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case
of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of event,
with the same or different event identities, is counted as separate
reporting criterion in Table 9.1.4.2-1.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to Table 9.1.4.2-1. For the measurement
categories belonging to intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT
measurements (i.e. without counting other categories that the UE shall
always support in parallel), the UE need not support more than the total
number of reporting criteria as follows:

\- For UE configured with EN-DC:
$E_{\text{cat},\text{EN} - \text{DC},\text{NR}} + E_{\text{cat},\text{EN} - \text{DC},E - \text{UTRA}}$,
where

$E_{cat,EN - DC,NR} = 10 + 9 \times n$ is the total number of NR
reporting criteria configured by PSCell (NR intra- and inter-frequency
reporting criteria) and by E-UTRA PCell on NR serving frequencies (NR
intra-frequency reporting criteria) applicable for UE configured with
EN-DC according to Table 9.1.4.2-1, and n is the number of configured NR
serving frequencies, including PSCell and SCells carrier frequencies,

$E_{cat,EN - DC,E - \text{UTRA}}$ is the total number of reporting
criteria configured by E-UTRA PCell except PSCell and SCells carrier
frequencies, as specified in TS 36.133 \[15\] for UE configured with
EN-DC.

### 9.1.5 Carrier-specific scaling factor

This clause specifies the derivation of carrier-specific scaling factor
(CSSF) values, which scales the measurement delay requirements given in
clause 9.2, 9.2A, 9.3, 9.3A, 9.4, and NR PRS-based positioning
measurements in clause 9.9 and CSI-RS based L3 measurement in clause
9.10 when UE is configured to monitor multiple measurement objects. The
CSSF values are categorized into CSSF~outside\_gap,i~,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~, for the measurements
conducted outside measurement gaps, within measurement gaps and within
NCSG, respectively.

If concurrent measurement gaps are configured by the network, subject to
UE capability, \[the term of the union of concurrent measurement gaps in
the following clauses refer to non-dropped measurement gap occasions
**after accounting for measurment gap collisions as specified in
clause** 9.1.8.3 from all the configured measurement gap patterns. The
term of the associated measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps in
the following clauses refer to non-dropped measurement gap occasions
**associated by measurement object** *i* **after accounting for
measurment gap collisions as specified in clause** 9.1.8.3\].

#### 9.1.5.1 Monitoring of multiple layers outside gaps

For a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured the carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for
measurement object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types :*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2.5 and 9.2A.5, when none of the SMTC occasions of this
intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the union of
concurrent measurement gaps.

> \- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
> clause 9.2.5 and 9.2A.5, when part of the SMTC occasions of this
> intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the union of
> concurrent measurement gaps.

\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.2, when none
of CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped the union of concurrent measurement
gaps.

\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.2, when all
CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this intra-frequency measurement
object are partially overlapped the union of concurrent measurement
gaps.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3.9, when none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped or the union of concurrent measurement
gaps, if UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3.9, when part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of
concurrent measurement gaps, if UE supports
*interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

Otherwise, the carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for
measurement object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types:*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2.5 and 9.2A.5, when none of the SMTC occasions of this
intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the measurement
gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2.5 and 9.2A.5, when part of the SMTC occasions of this
intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the measurement
gap.

\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.2, when none
of CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.2, when all
CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this intra-frequency measurement
object are partially overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3.9, when none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3.9, when part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

> \- For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, NR SSB-based
> inter-RAT measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN PCell on an NR
> serving carrier

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- none or part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-RAT measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap;

\- Intra-frequency RSSI and channel occupancy measurement with no
measurement gap on a carrier subject to CCA when SMTC and RMTC are
overlapping and RMTCs are not fully overlapped with measurement gap.

The UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object
*i* only outside the measurement gap(s).

For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, if a measurement
object configured by PSCell and an NR inter-RAT measurment object
configured by E-UTRAN PCell are on the same serving carrier, they shall
be counted as one intra-frequency measurement object, provided that they
meet the measurement object merging conditions in clause 9.1.3.2.

The number of frequency layers for SSB measurements shall include the
total number of MOs with

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* configured, or

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* not configured *but csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility
configured with associatedSSB*.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

The UE cell identification and measurement periods derived based on
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clauses 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2 and 9.10.2 may be
extended for measurement objects of which the cell identification and
measurement periods are overlapped with T~measure\_SFTD1~ specified in
clause 9.3.8 when no measurement gaps are provided.

The requirements in this clause apply provided that

\- The SMTC on all CCs and inter-frequency layers without measurement
gap in FR2 have the same offset, and one of following conditions is met

\- If *smtc2* is configured on any FR2 CC,

\- All CCs have the same configuration for *smtc1*, and

\- All CCs configured with *smtc2* have the same configuration for
*smtc2*

\- If *smtc2* is not configured on any FR2 CC,

\- The total number of different SMTC periodicities on all serving CCs
and inter-frequency layers without measurement gap does not exceed 4

\- The starting point of the first 5ms window for CSI-RS measurement as
defined in clause 9.10.1 on all CCs in FR2 is same and one of following
conditions is met

\- If any CSI-RS resource is configured in the second 5ms window for
CSI-RS measurement as defined in clause 9.10.1 on any FR2 CC,

\- All CCs with CSI-RS resources only in the first 5ms window have the
same CSI-RS resource periodcity, and

\- All CCs with CSI-RS resources both in the first and the second 5ms
window have the same CSI-RS resource periodcity

\- If no CSI-RS resource is configured in the second 5ms window for
CSI-RS measurement as defined in clause 9.10.1 on any FR2 CC,

\- The total number of different CSI-RS resources periodicities on all
serving CCs does not exceed 3Note: Longer delays for cell identification
and measurement periods derived based on CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clauses
9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2, can be expected, if the UE is configured with more
than 4 different SMTC periodicities on FR2 serving carriers. The longer
delay applies for the FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects with the
longest SMTC periodicity/periodicities.

##### 9.1.5.1.1 EN-DC mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based, CSI-RS based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed outside gaps

For UE configured with the E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, the
carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for intra-frequency
SSB-based measurements, inter-frequency SSB-based measurements performed
outside measurements gaps, intra-frequency CSI-RS L3 measurement and
RSSI/channel occupancy measurement with no measurement gap on a carrier
subject to CCA when SMTC and RMTC are overlapping will be as specified
in Table 9.1.5.1.1-1.

##### 9.1.5.1.2 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based, CSI-RS based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed outside gaps

For UE in SA operation mode, the carrier-specific scaling factor
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for intra-frequency SSB-based measurements,
inter-frequency SSB-based measurements performed outside measurements
gaps, intra-frequency CSI-RS L3 measurement and RSSI/channel occupancy
measurement with no measurement gap on a carrier subject to CCA when
SMTC and RMTC are overlapping will be as specified in Table 9.1.5.1.2-1,
which shall also be applied for a UE configured with NE-DC operation.

#### 9.1.5.2 Monitoring of multiple layers within gaps

For a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured the carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for a
measurement object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types for the associated measurement gap:*

> \- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with no measurement
> gap in clause 9.2.5 and 9.2A.5, when

\- all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object
are overlapped with the associated measurement gap in concurrent
measurement gaps, or

> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
> SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are
> overlapped with the union of concurrent measurement gaps.
>
> \- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with measurement gap
> in clause 9.2.6 and 9.2A.6.
>
> \- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.3, when
> CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this inter-frequency
> measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap or the
> associated measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps.
>
> \- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.3, when
> CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this inter-frequency
> measurement object are partially overlapped by the measurement gap or
> the associated measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps.
>
> \- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.2, when all
> CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this intra-frequency
> measurement object are partially overlapped with the associated
> measurement gap and all CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this
> intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped with the union of
> the configured concurrent measurement gaps.
>
> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap
> in clause 9.3.4.
>
> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement
> gap for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap* in clause 9.3.9, when
>
> \- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap or associated
> measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement

Otherwise, the carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for a
measurement object *i* derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types:

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with no measurement gap
in clause 9.2.5 and 9.2A.5, when all of the SMTC occasions of this
intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the measurement.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.2.6 and 9.2A.6.

\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.3, when
CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this inter-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.10.3, when
CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this inter-frequency measurement
object are partially overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.3.4.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap
for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap* in clause 9.3.9, when

\- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap, or

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap, but the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is not configured by the Network.

\- Intra-frequency RSSI/CO measurement with measurement gap in clause
9.2A.7.

\- Intra-frequency RSSI/CO measurement with no measurement gap in clause
9.2A.7 when all of the RMTC occasions of this intra-frequency RSSI/CO
measurement are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- Inter-frequency RSSI/CO measurement in clause 9.3A.8 and 9.3A.9.

\- E-UTRA Inter-RAT measurement object in clauses 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

\- NR PRS-based measurements for positioning in clause 9.9.

\- E-UTRA Inter-RAT RSTD and E-CID measurements in clauses 9.4.4 and
9.4.5.

\- For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, NR SSB-based
Inter-RAT measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN PCell (TS 36.133
\[15\] clause 8.17.4) on an NR serving carrier

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-RAT measurement object are
overlapped by the measurement gap;

PCell (TS 36.133 \[15\] clause 8.17.3) and by the E-UTRAN PSCell (TS
36.133 \[15\] clause 8.19.3).

\- E-UTRAN Inter-frequency RSTD measurement configured by the E-UTRAN
PCell (TS 36.133 \[15\] clause 8.17.15).

\- GSM Inter-RAT measurements configured by the E-UTRAN PCell (TS 36.133
\[15\] clauses 8.17.13 and 8.17.14).

The UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object
*i* only within the measurement gap or the associated measurement gap if
concurrent measurement gaps are configured. If UE is configured with
concurrent measurement gaps and an association between measurement
object i and certain measurement gap is provided, the requirements are
defined assuming the UE shall conduct the measurement of this
measurement object *i* within the associated measurement gap.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

Number of SSB layers shall include SSB for mobility andassociated SSB
for CSI-RS mobility. The ssbfrequency is counted only once if the
ssbfrequency for mobility and associated SSB are the same, or
ssbfrequency and smtc in multiple MOs are the same.

SSB-based measurement and CSI-RS based measurement for mobility
configured in the same measurement object are considered as different
layers.

##### 9.1.5.2.1 EN-DC mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB, CSI-RS-based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed within gaps

The scaling value CSSF~within\_gap,i~ below has been derived without
considering GSM inter-RAT carriers.

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*.

For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, if a SSB-based
measurement object configured by PSCell and an NR SSB-based inter-RAT
measurement object configured by E-UTRAN PCell are on the same carrier,
they shall be counted as one measurement object in M~tot,i,j~, provided
that they meet the measurement object merging conditions \[in clause
9.1.3.2\].

If measurement object *i* refers to an RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is
configured, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~
for other measurement objects (including RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs=160ms) participate in the gap competition are derived
as below.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
count the total number of intra-frequency measurement objects and
inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects which are candidates to be
measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR carriers,
if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is
configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the
value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise the assumed
periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc1*.

\- An NR measurement object with CSI-RS measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time. -

\- An NR measurement object with RSSI and channel occupancy measurement
is a candidate to be measurement in a gap if the RMTC duration is fully
covered by MGL excluding RF switching time

\- An inter-RAT UTRA measurement object configured by E-UTRA PCell
\[15\] is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- An inter-frequency E-UTRA measurement object configured by E-UTRA
PCell \[15\] is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects,
including both SSB, CSI-RS based and RSSI/CO measurement, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB
and CSI-RS based NR inter-RAT frequency layer and RSSI/CO measurement,
configured by E-UTRA PCell, EUTRA inter-frequency measurement objects

configured by E-UTRA PCell which are candidates to be measured in gap
*j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise
M~inter,i,j~ equals 0.

\- A measurement object *i* in M~intra,i,j~ and in M~inter,i,j~ is
counted twice if the measurement object is configured with both RMTC and
SMTC which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT frequency layers which
are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object
*i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurement
object, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~ ≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~=0, where

Where R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the number of
measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate and not used
for RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity
Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary
1280ms period.

##### 9.1.5.2.2 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB, CSI-RS-based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*.

If a UE capable of concurrent gaps is configured with concurrent gaps,
the carrier specific scaling factor is calculated separately for each
gap pattern, \[provided that the association between measurement objects
and gap pattern is configured by network. Only the measurement objects
associated to the same measurement gap pattern are counted when deriving
CSSFwithin\_gap,I for a target measurement object with index i.\]. In
case of collision between concurrent measurement gaps, some measurement
gap occasions may be dropped according to clause \[9.1.X2.x\]. The
dropped gap occasions will not be used in deriving CSSFwithin\_gap,i.

If measurement object *i* refers to a long-periodicity measurement which
is any of:

\- an E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with
periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured, or

\- an NR measurement for positioning frequency layer i with
Tavailable\_PRS,i \>160ms, where Tavailable\_PRS,i is defined in clauses
9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP , UE Rx-Tx time
difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements, respectively.

then CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for other
measurement objects (including E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs=160ms) participate in the gap competition and the
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ are derived as below.

with the following steps assuming no other positioning frequency layer
is configured.

\- for each RRM frequency layer i, CSSFwithin\_gap,i is derived as
follows:

\- an intermediate CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~ is derived with the following
steps assuming only positioning frequency layer *k* is configured, and

\- CSSF~within\_gap,i~= max(CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~), where *k*=0...K-1,
and K is the number of configured positioning frequency layers. For each
measurement gap *j* not used for a long-periodicity measurement defined
above, count the total number of intra-frequency measurement objects and
inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR PRS measurements on
all positioning frequency layers which are candidates to be measured
within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

measurement gaps, is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- A positioning frequency layer is counted as candidate for a MG
occasion if at least one PRS resource on that positioning frequency
layer is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis. For UEs which
support and are configured with per FR gaps, the CSSF requirements do
not apply when NR PRS measurement in one FR gap collides with
SSB/CSI-RS/PRS measurements in the other FR gap in time domain.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects,
including both SSB, CSI-RS based and RSSI/CO measurements, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB
and CSI-RS based, EUTRA inter-RAT and UTRA inter-RAT frequency layers,
up to one positioning frequency layer, RSSI/CO measurements, which are

also a candidate. Otherwise M~inter,i,j~ equals 0.

\- A measurement object *i* in M~intra,i,j~ and in M~inter,i,j~ is
counted twice if the measurement object is configured with both RMTC and
SMTC which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT frequncy layers and up to
one NR PRS measurement on any one positioning frequency layer, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier
specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

cell detection of the inter-RAT E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference
cell when acquiring the subframe and slot timing of the cell according
to clause 9.4.4. In this case, the UE cell identification and

9.10.2 may be extended for measurement objects of which the cell
identification and measurement periods are overlapped with
T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ and T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~.

##### 9.1.5.2.3 NE-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based and CSI-RS based L3 measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*.

If measurement object *i* refers to a long-periodicty measurement which
is any of:

clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP , UE
Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements, respectively.

then CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for other
measurement objects (including E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs=160ms) participate in the gap competition are derived as below.

When multiple positioning frequency layers are configured,

\- for each positioning frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is
derived with the following steps assuming no other positioning frequency

and K is the number of configured positioning frequency layers.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, count the total number of intra-frequency measurement
objects and inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR PRS
measurements on all positioning frequency layers which are candidates to
be measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of

layer is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the counting
is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured with per UE
gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis. For UEs which support and
are configured with per FR gaps, the CSSF requirements do not apply when
NR PRS measurement in one FR gap collides with SSB/CSI-RS/PRS
measurements in the other FR gap in time domain.

M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier
specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

##### 9.1.5.2.4 NR-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based and CSI-RS-based L3 measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*.

If measurement object *i* refers to a long-periodicity measurement which
is any of:

\- an E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with
periodicity Tprs=160ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured, or

\- an NR measurement for positioning frequency layer i with
T~available\_PRS,i~ \>160ms, where T~available\_PRS,i~ is defined in
clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP , UE
Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements, respectively.

then CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for other
measurement objects (including E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs=160ms) participate in the gap competition and the
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ are derived as below.

When multiple positioning frequency layers are configured,

\- for each positioning frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is
derived with the following steps assuming no other positioning frequency
layer is configured.

\- for each RRM frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is derived as
follows:

\- an intermediate CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~ is derived with the following
steps assuming only positioning frequency layer *k* is configured, and

\- CSSF~within\_gap,i~= max(CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~), where *k*=0...K-1,
and K is the number of configured positioning frequency layers.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160ms period,
count the total number of intra-frequency measurement objects and
inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR PRS measurements on
all positioning frequency layers which are candidates to be measured
within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of

candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- A positioning frequency layer is counted as candidate for a MG
occasion if at least one PRS resource on that positioning frequency
layer is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the counting
is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured with per UE
gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis. For UEs which support and
are configured with per FR gaps, the CSSF requirements do not apply when
NR PRS measurement in one FR gap collides with SSB/CSI-RS/PRS
measurements in the other FR gap in time domain.

If the number of configured interfrequency and interRAT measuerement
objects and NR PRS measurements on all positioning frequency layers is
non-zero and the UE is configured with per UE gaps, or if the UE is
configured with per FR gaps:

FR1 and FR2 intrafrequency measurement objects belong to group A

Interfrequency and interRAT measurement objects and up to one NR PRS
measurement on any one positioning frequency layer belong to group B

M~groupA,i,j~: Sum of the number of FR1 intra-frequency measurement
objects M~intra-FR1,i,j~ and the number of FR2 intra-frequency
measurement objects M~intra-FR2,i,j~ , including both SSB and CSI-RS
based, which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupA,i,j~
equals 0.

M~groupBi,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB
and CSI-RS based, EUTRA inter-RAT and UTRA inter-RAT measurement objects
and up to one positioning frequency layer, which are candidates to be
measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is also a
candidate. Otherwise M~groupB,i,j~ equals 0.

If the number of configured interfrequency and interRAT measuerement
objects and NR PRS measurements on all positioning frequency layers is
zero and the UE is configured with per UE gaps:

FR1 intrafrequency measurement objects belong to group A

FR2 intrafrequency measurement objects belong to group B

M~groupA,i,j~: The number of FR1 intrafrequency measurement objects
M~intra-FR1,i,j~ , including both SSB and CSI-RS based, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupA,i,j~ equals 0.

M~groupBi,j~ : The number of FR2 intrafrequency measurement objects
M~intra-FR2,i,j~ , including both SSB and CSI-RS based, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupB,i,j~ equals 0.

M~tot,i,j~ = M~groupA,i,j~ + M~groupB,i,j~ : Total number of group A and
group B measurement objects which are candidates to be measured in gap
*j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise
M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier
specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is a group A measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~groupA,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupB,i,j~≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~groupA,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupB,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an group B measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~groupBi,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~ ≠0,

\- ceil(R~i~×M~groupB,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the number of
measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate and not used
for a long-periodicity measurement defined above.

##### 9.1.5.2.5 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for PRS-based measurements performed within gaps

The requirements in this clause apply for NR PRS-based measurements for
positioning in clause 9.9.

When NR PRS-based measurements for positioning are configured on one or
more positioning frequency layers within measurement gaps, the carrier
specific scaling factor for a target PRS-based positioning measurement
on a positioning frequency layer with index *i* is designated as
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is derived as described in clause 9.1.5.2.2.

*NR Positioning measurement requirements for long periodicity
measurements apply in case all PRS resources in the PFL are configured
with periodicity \> 160 ms.*

##### 9.1.5.2.6 NE-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for PRS-based measurements performed within gaps

The requirements in this clause apply for NR PRS-based measurements for
positioning in clause 9.9.

When NR PRS-based measurements for positioning are configured on one or
more positioning frequency layers within measurement gaps, the carrier
specific scaling factor for a target measurement on a positioning
frequency layer with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and
is derived as described in clause 9.1.5.2.3.

*NR Positioning measurement requirements for long periodicity
measurements apply in case all PRS resources in the PFL are configured
with periodicity \> 160 ms.*

##### 9.1.5.2.7 NR-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for PRS-based measurements performed within gaps

The requirements in this clause apply for NR PRS-based measurements for
positioning in clause 9.9.

When NR PRS-based measurements for positioning are configured on one or
more positioning frequency layers within measurement gaps, the carrier
specific scaling factor for a target measurement on a positioning
frequency layer with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and
is derived as described in clause 9.1.5.2.4.

*NR Positioning measurement requirements for long periodicity
measurements apply in case all PRS resources in the PFL are configured
with periodicity \> 160 ms.*

#### 9.1.5.3 Monitoring of multiple layers within NCSG

The measurement requirements derived from CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ defined
in this clause are applicable provided that network provides NCSG
pattern for measurement.

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ for a
measurement object *i derived in this clause is applied to following
measurement types:*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object without measurement gap
as defined in clause 9.2.1 corresponding to an activated serving cell,
when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the NCSG;

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with NCSG as defined in
clause 9.2.1 corresponding to an activated serving cell (in
non-dormancy) , when all or part of the SMTC occasions of this
intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the NCSG;

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object corresponding to a
deactivated Serving cell or to an activated Serving cell in dormancy,
when all or part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the NCSG regardless of the UE
capability reporting of *intraFreq-needForNCSG*;

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap
as defined in clause 9.3.1, when all of the SMTC occasions of this
inter-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the NCSG;

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with NCSG as defined in
clause 9.3.1;

\- E-UTRA inter-RAT measurement object, when the measurement can be
performed with no measurement gap but NCSG as defined in clause 9.4;

UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object *i*
only within the NCSG.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
for an intra-frequency measurement object, and *smtc1* is fully
overlapping with NCSG and *smtc2* is partially overlapping with NCSG,
requirements derived from CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ and CSSF~outside\_gap,i~
are not applicable.

##### 9.1.5.3.1 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for measurements performed within NCSG

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within NCSG, the
carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement object with
index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ and is derived as
described in this clause.

For each NCSG occasion *j*, count the total number of intra-frequency
measurement objects and inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects
which are candidates to be measured within the occaison *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in an NCSG occasion if its SMTC duration is
fully covered by the ML. For intra-frequency NR measurement objects, if
the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise the assumed periodicity of
SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc1*.

\- An inter-RAT E-UTRA measurement object configured is a candidate to
be measured in all NCSG occasions.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects which are
candidates to be measured in NCSG occasion *j* where the measurement
object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

> \- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency measurement objects and
> E-UTRA inter-RAT measurement objects which are candidates to be
> measured in NCSG occasion *j* where the measurement object *i* is also
> a candidate. Otherwise M~inter,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects which
are candidates to be measured in NCSG occasion *j* where the measurement
object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR NCSG, the above
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE NCSG the counting is done on a per UE basis.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~=
max(M~tot,i,j~), where *j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in NCSG occasions where M~inter,i,j~≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- M~intra,i,j~ in NCSG occasions where M~inter,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurement
object, CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(K~inter~×M~inter,i,j~) in NCSG occasions where M~intra,i,j~ ≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- M~inter,i,j~ in NCSG occasions where M~intra,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- K~intra~ and K~inter~ are defined in clause 9.1.2.1a.

### 9.1.6 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within gaps or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within NCSG or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

The carrier-specific scaling factor specified in clause 9.1.5 that
applies to the other impacted measurement objects will also apply based
on the longer measurement or cell identification delay before or after
the transition.

When the UE transitions between DRX and non-DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements apply based on the longer delay before or after the
transition.

Subsequent to this measurement period, the cell identification and
measurement period requirements on each measurement object are
corresponding to the second mode after transition.

### 9.1.7 Pre-configured measurement gap

#### 9.1.7.1 Introduction

A UE capable of Pre-configured measurement gap (Pre-MG) pattern can be
configured with a Pre-MG pattern via RRC signalling \[2\].

The gap interruption requirements in Section 9.1.2 apply to Pre-MG when
Pre-MG is activated, and no gap interruption is expected when Pre-MG is
deactivated.

\- The requirements apply for NR standalone operation with single
carrier and NR CA.

#### 9.1.7.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements related to pre-configured measurement gap apply
provided:

\- UE indicates support of *preconfiguredUE-AutonomousMeasGap* \[2\]
and/or *preconfiguredNW-ControlledMeasGap* \[2\], and

\- either a single per-UE measurement gap is pre-configured by the
network, or one or two per-FR measurement gaps are pre-configured by the
network, and

\- one of measurement gap patterns among measurement gap patterns \#0 \~
\#25 is configured for pre-configured measurement gap, and

\- UE is in NR SA with single carrier or with NR CA.

A measurement gap is configured as pre-configured measurement gap if
*preConfigInd* is indicated by network in the configuration message of
the measurement gap.

If UE indicates support of only *preconfiguredNW-ControlledMeasGap*
\[2\], UE can expect the network to configure *preConfGapStatus*.

If a measurement gap is configured as pre-configured measurement gap,
the applicability of measurement gap patterns is defined in Table
9.1.2-3.

When a pre-configured measurement gap is used to perform PRS
measurements, the UE will inform the network that it is going to
start/stop PRS measurements with the configured pre-configured
measurement gap by initiating the existing
*LocationMeasurementIndication* procedure.

If the Pre-MG status changes during a measurement period of a
measurement that can be performed without and within measurement gaps,
the UE is allowed to restart the measurement.

If the Pre-MG status changes from activated to deactivated during a
measurement period of a measurement that can only be performed within
measurement gaps, the measurement requirements do not apply.

#### 9.1.7.3 Requirements

Any of the measurement Gap pattern \#0 to \#25 defined in Table 9.1.2-1
can be configured as Pre-MG pattern.

The UE can determine the Pre-MG status based on autonomous
activation/deactivation mechanism or based on network-controlled
activation/deactivation mechanism.

A UE capable of both autonomous and network-controlled mechanisms for
activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern will not use autonomous rules
to determine the activation/deactivation status of the pre-configured MG
if the network provides the activation/deactivation status via RRC
indication *preConfGapStatus* for all the DL BWPs of all the activated
CCs, and for all the deactivated SCCs.

##### 9.1.7.3.1 Requirements for autonomous activation/deactivation mechanism

Requirements in this section apply when autonomous mechanism \[2\] is
used for activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern.

The UE can autonomously change the Pre-MG status from activation to
deactivation or vice versa based on any of the following triggering
conditions listed below. The UE shall also autonomously determine the
Pre-MG status based on all the concurrent triggering conditions
occurring jointly:

\- DCI, timer or RRC based active BWP switching,

\- Activation/deactivation of SCell(s),

\- Addition/removal of any measurement object(s)

\- Addition/release/change of a SCell in carrier aggregation,

The UE shall autonomously determine the status of the per-UE Pre-MG
pattern as deactivated immediately after the configuration of the per-UE
Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering conditions above is
satisfied provided that all the configured measurements can be performed
without measurement gaps. The UE shall autonomously determine the status
of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern as deactivated immediately after the
configuration of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering
conditions above is satisfied provided that all the configured
measurements in the same FR can be performed without measurement gaps.

A measurement can be performed by the UE without measurement gaps if any
of the following conditions is met:

\- The UE is configured with SSB based intra-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based intra-frequency measurement without
gaps in Clause 9.2.1 are met, or

\- The UE is configured with SSB based inter-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based inter-frequency measurement without
gaps in Clause 9.3.1 are met, or

\- The UE is configured with CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements.

The UE shall autonomously determine the status of the per-UE Pre-MG
pattern as activated immediately after the configuration of the per-UE
Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering conditions above is
satisfied provided that at least one of the configured measurements
cannot be performed without measurement gaps. The UE shall autonomously
determine the status of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern as activated
immediately after the configuration of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern or when
any of the triggering conditions above is satisfied provided that at
least one of the configured measurements in the same FR cannot be
performed without measurement gaps.

A measurement cannot be performed by the UE without measurement gaps if
any of the following conditions is met:

\- The UE is configured with SSB based intra-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based intra-frequency measurement without
gaps in Clause 9.2.1 are not met, or

\- The UE is configured with SSB based inter-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based inter-frequency measurement without
gaps in Clause 9.3.1 are not met, or

\- The UE is configured with any of the following measurements:

\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurements, or

\- E-UTRA Inter-RAT measurements, or

\- UTRA Inter-RAT measurements.

##### 9.1.7.3.2 Requirements for network-controlled activation/deactivation mechanism

The requirements in this section apply when network-controlled mechanism
\[2\] is used for activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern.

For per-UE Pre-configured MG,

\- the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is activated if
*preConfGapStatus* is set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for the
active DL BWP of any of the activated CCs, or if *preConfGapStatus* is
set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for any of the deactivated SCCs,

\- otherwise, the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is
deactivated

For per-FR Pre-configured MG,

\- the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is activated if
*preConfGapStatus* is set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for the
active DL BWP of any of the activated CCs in the corresponding FR, or if
*preConfGapStatus* is set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for any of
the deactivated SCCs in the corresponding FR,

\- otherwise, the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is
deactivated

##### 9.1.7.3.3 Requirements for reception/transmission during activation/deactivation

The requirements in this section apply when autonomous mechanism or
network-controlled mechanism is used for activation/deactivation \[2\]
of Pre-MG pattern.

If per-UE Pre-MG pattern is activated then the UE is not required to
conduct reception/transmission from/to the corresponding serving cells
during the gap occasion according to the same principles as described
for per-UE measurement gaps in clause 9.1.2. Otherwise, the UE can be
scheduled for reception/transmission of signals in all the serving cells
during the gap occasion.

If per-FR Pre-MG pattern is activated then the UE is not required to
conduct reception/transmission from/to the corresponding serving cells
during the gap occasion on the same FR according to the same principles
as described for per-FR measurement gaps in clause 9.1.2. Otherwise, the
UE can be scheduled for reception/transmission of signals in all the
serving cells during the gap occasion in the same FR.

### 9.1.8 Concurrent measurement gaps

#### 9.1.8.1 Introduction

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap pattern capability, network
can provide multiple measurement gaps configured by RRC message(s) as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Requirements in this section apply when
the UE is in SA operation mode.

#### 9.1.8.2 Requirements

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports *concurrentPerUE-OnlyMeasGap-r17* as
specified in \[14\], in order for the requirements in the following
clauses to apply, the network can provide at most two per-UE measurement
gap patterns for monitoring of all frequency layers.

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports
*concurrentPerUE-PerFRCombMeasGap-r17* as specified in \[14\], in order
for the requirements defined for concurrent measurement gaps to apply,
the network can provide the measurement gap pattern combinations
specified in Table 9.1.8-1 for monitoring of all frequency layers.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For UE configured in the SA operation mode, when monitoring of multiple
inter-RAT E-UTRAN carrier frequency layers, intra-frequency NR carrier
frequency layers and/or inter-frequency NR carrier frequency layers as
configured by PCell using gaps, each monitored carrier frequency layer,
including *following measurement types:*

\- a measurement object with SSB based measurement,

\- a measurement object with CSI-RS based measurement,

\- E-UTRA inter-RAT measurement object,

\- E-UTRAN inter-RAT RSTD measurement,

\- NR PRS-based positioning measurements,

can be only associated to one measurement gap pattern. Requirements for
concurrent measurement gaps apply provided that each frequency layer is
only associated with one concurrent measurement gap. There can be one or
more frequency layers associated with each concurrent measurement gap.
Furthermore, if the UE is not capable of
concurrentMeasGapEUTRA-r17\[2\], all E-UTRAN measurement objects shall
be associated with a single concurrent gap pattern for the requirement
to apply.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns, each measurement
gap pattern supported by the UE is listed in Table 9.1.2-1 based on the
applicability specified in table 9.1.2-3.

The requirements in clause 9.1.2 are also applicable for the UE capable
of and configured with multiple concurrent measurement gap patterns
within each measurement gap pattern.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns and configured with
more than 1 measurement gap pattern Per FR or Per-UE according to table
9.1.8-1, requirements does not apply if the UE is configured with more
than one measurement gap pattern (MGP) with measurement gap repetition
period (MGRP) of 20ms in an FR.

#### 9.1.8.3 Collision between concurrent measurement gaps

Collisions between occasions of two concurrent measurement gaps may
occur as specified in this clause if the two measurement gaps are

\- two per-UE measurement gaps, or

\- two per-FR measurement gaps in the same FR, or

\- one per-UE measurement gap and one per-FR measurement gap.

When UE is configured with concurrent measurement gaps, two measurement
gap occasions are considered colliding if at least one of the following
conditions is met:

\- the two occasions are fully or partially overlapping in time domain,
or

\- the distance between the two occasions is equal to or smaller than
4ms.

The distance between two measurement gap occasions is defined as the
time difference between the ending point of the first occasion and the
starting point of the second occasion, where the first measurement gap
occasion occurs earlier in time than the second measurement gap
occasion.

In case of collision between two measurement gap occasions, the UE shall
perform measurements in the occasion of the measurement gap with higher
priority, and the occasion of the measurement gap with lower priority
shall be dropped. The UE shall be able to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or
receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI in the corresponding NR serving
cells in the slots that are not interrupted according to requirements in
clause 9.1.8.4.

The requirements of concurrent measurement gaps in section 9 shall not
apply when a gap without assigned priority is configured simultaneously
with any other gap(s) that affect serving carriers in the same FR and
the measurement gaps are colliding with each other.

The priority for a measurement gap is configured by networks via
*gapPriority* in *GapConfig*. The requirements with concurrent
measurement gaps apply provided that two measurement gaps colliding with
each other are configured with different priorities.

#### 9.1.8.4 Measurement gap related requirements of concurrent measurement gaps

A slot is considered as interrupted if it is interrupted by an occasion
of any of the configured concurrent measurement gaps following the
measurement gap interruption requirements in clause 9.1.2, except for a
dropped measurement gap occasion.

### 9.1.9 Network controlled small gap

#### 9.1.9.1 Introduction

The UE capable of network controlled small gap (NCSG) pattern can be
configured with a NCSG pattern via RRC signalling \[2\].

This clause contains the general requirements on the UE regarding to
Network Controlled Small Gap (NCSG).

The requirements in this clause are applicable for UE configured with SA
NR (with single carrier or NR CA) operation mode.

It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to conduct
transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when *mgta* is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with
respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the
DL slots occurring immediately after the last each of the interrupted
slots after VIL1 and VIL2.

\- when *mgta* is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than
15kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after the last each of the interrupted slots after VIL1 and VIL2.

\- when *mgta* is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15kHz, in the
L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with
the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after the
slot partially overlapped with each of the interrupted slots after VIL1
and VIL2.

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

Note: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

The interruptions of NCSG in number of slots are listed in Table 9.1.9-1
on all serving cells when per-UE NCSG is configured with pattern \#0-11
or on FR1 serving cells when per-FR FR1 NCSG is configured to
*ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17* capable UE. The interruptions of NCSG in number
of slots are listed in Table 9.1.9-2 on all serving cells when per-UE
NCSG is configured with pattern \#12-23 or on FR2 serving cells when
per-FR FR2 NCSG is configured to *ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17* capable UE.
There are two interruptions in each NCSG occasion, VIL1 before ML and
VIL2 after ML, in NR standalone (with single carrier or NR CA). Each of
them has number of interrupted slots captured in Table 9.1.9-1 and Table
9.1.9-2.

#### 9.1.9.2 Requirements applicability

Requirements in clause 9.1.9 apply for UE capable of NCSG in standalone
NR in both FR1 and FR2 (including FR1+FR2 CA), provided UE is configured
with only NCSG and no other measurement gap is configured, and UE is
configured with

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurement (including measurement on
de-activated SCC and measurement on dormant SCell), and/or

\- SSB based inter-frequency measurement, and/or

\- Inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurement.

Requirements for the following measurements do not apply if UE is
configured with NCSG.

\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement when overlapped with NCSG,
or

\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement, or

\- Inter-RAT GSM measurement, ***or***

\- Inter-RAT UTRAN measurement, ***or***

***- PRS measurement.***

9.1.9.3 Requirements

The UE shall support NCSG patterns defined in Table 9.1.9.3-1 that are
relevant to the UE's measurement capabilities. ML is the measurement
length. During the VIL1 and VIL2, the UE is not expected to transmit and
receive any data. Where, VIL1 is the visible interruption length before
the ML and VIL2 is the visible interruption length after the ML. During
ML, whether the UE shall transmit and receive data on the corresponding
serving carrier(s) depends on the scheduling restriction requirements
specified in clauses 9.2.7.3, 9.3.10.3, 9.4.2.5 and 9.4.3.5. The NCSG
parameters VIL1, ML, VIL2 and VIRP are illustrated in Figure 9.1.9.3-1.
The applicability of the NCSG patterns in Table 9.1.9.3-1 is specified
in Table 9.1.9.3-2..

### 9.1.10 MUSIM gaps

If the UE requires gap patterns for MUSIM purpose, such as cell
identification and measurement, paging monitoring, SIB acquisition,
and/or on-demand SI request of the target cell in the target network,
then the network may provide one or more per-UE MUSIM gap pattern(s) for
concurrent monitoring of all frequency layers for MUSIM via
*MUSIM-GapConfig* \[2\]. The UE can be configured with no more than
three periodic MUSIM gap patterns and/or one aperiodic MUSIM gap pattern
for MUSIM via *MUSIM-GapConfig* \[2\]. The MUSIM gap patterns specified
in Table 9.1.10-1 are applicable only for MUSIM operation.

The UE is not required to perform cell identification and measurement,
paging monitoring, SIB acquisition, and/or on-demand SI request of the
target cell in the target network that is outside the MUSIM gaps.

The UE is not required to conduct reception or transmission from or to
the network during MUSIM gaps.

UE supporting MUSIM capability shall support the MUSIM gap patterns
listed in Table 9.1.10-1 based on UE's capability specified in
TS38.306\[14\] and the applicability specified in Table 9.1.10-2.

UE determines MUSIM gap timing based on gap offset configuration from
serving cell provided by higher layer signalling as specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

An uplink gap consists of consecutive static UL slot(s) in one or more
*TDD-UL-DL-Pattern* duration, starting from the first static UL slot of
an UL gap repetition period. UGL is the aggregated length of consecutive
UL slots used as the UL gap within an UL gap repetition period. That
means, there can be a DL slot and/or special slot but no static UL slot
between the two consecutive static UL slots within the UL gap length.

When an UL gap overlaps with an uplink transmission in NR serving cells
in FR2 single CC or FR2 intra-band CA or FR2 inter-band CA where UE does
not support tx-Support-UL-GapFR2-r17, then the UE is not required to
conduct any transmission during the UL gap on the NR serving cells other
than those listed in Clause 5.30 in TS 38.321 \[7\].

9.1A General measurement requirement for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------

### 9.1A.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the RedCap UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements are
split in intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD,
inter-RAT E-UTRAN TDD, and L1-RSRP measurements requirements. These
measurements may be used by the NG-RAN. The measurement quantities are
defined in TS38.215 \[4\], the measurement model is defined in TS38.300
\[10\], TS37.340 \[17\] and measurement accuracies are specified in
clause 10. Control of measurement reporting is specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

The SSB and SMTC in this section applies for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if
it is not additional specified.

### 9.1A.2 Measurement gap

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE does not support independent measurement gap
patterns for different frequency ranges as specified in Table 5.1-1 in
\[18, 19, 20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses
to apply the network must provide a single per-UE measurement gap
pattern for concurrent monitoring of all frequency layers.

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports independent measurement gap patterns
for different frequency ranges as specified in Table 5.1-1 in \[18, 19,
20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses to apply
the network must provide either per-FR measurement gap patterns for
frequency range where UE requires per-FR measurement gap for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of each frequency range
independently, or a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of all frequency ranges.

During the per-UE or per-FR measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cell for SA (with single carrier) except the
reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s), and the signals used
for random access procedure according to \[7\].

UEs shall support the measurement gap patterns listed in Table 9.1A.2-1
based on the applicability specified in Table 9.1A.2-2. UE determines
measurement gap timing based on gap offset configuration and measurement
gap timing advance configuration provided by higher layer signalling as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] and TS 36.331 \[16\].

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

If measurement gap is configured in one FR but measurement object is not
configured in the FR, the scheduling opportunity in the FR depends on
the configured measurement gap pattern.

For NR standalone operation (with single carrier), if UE is not capable
of per-FR-gap, total interruption time on a serving cell during MGL is
defined when MGL(N) = 6ms, 5.5ms, 4ms, 3.5ms, 3ms, and 1.5ms. And if UE
is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption time on FR1 serving cell
during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 6ms, 4ms, and 3ms, and total
interruption time on FR2 serving cell during MGL is defined only when
MGL(N) = 5.5ms, 3.5ms, and 1.5ms.

\(a\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0ms for
serving cell in synchronous NR standalone operation (with single
carrier)

\(b\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0.5ms
for serving cell in synchronous NR standalone operation (with single
carrier)

Figure 9.1A.2-1: Measurement GAP and total interruption time on serving
cell for NR standalone operation (with single carrier)

The corresponding total number of interrupted slots on serving cell is
listed in Table 9.1A.2-3 for serving cell in NR standalone (with single
carrier).

It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to conduct
transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when MGTA is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect
to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots
occurring immediately after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than
15kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15kHz, in the L
consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with the
same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after the slot
partially overlapped with measurement gap

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

#### 9.1A.2.1 SA: Measurement Gap Sharing

For NR standalone UE configured with per-UE measurement gap, measurement
gap sharing shall be applies when UE requires measurement gaps to
identify and measure cells on an intra-frequency carrier or when SMTC
configured for intra-frequency measurement are fully overlapping with
per-UE measurement gaps, and when UE requires measurement gaps to
identify and measure cells on inter-frequency carriers for SSB based L3
measurement, or when all of SMTC configured for inter-frequency SSB
based measurement without measurement gaps are fully overlapping with
per-UE measurement gaps or per-FR measurement gap, and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN carriers.

For NR standalone UE configured with per-FR1 measurement gap,
measurement gap sharing shall be applied when UE requires measurement
gaps to identify and measure cells on FR1 intra-frequency carriers or
when SMTC configured for FR1 intra-frequency measurement are fully
overlapping with per-FR1 measurement gaps, and when UE requires
measurement gaps to identify and measure cells on FR1 inter-frequency
carriers for SSB based L3 measurement and/or inter-RAT E-UTRAN carriers,
or when all of SMTC configured for inter-frequency SSB based measurement
without measurement gaps are fully overlapping with per-FR1 measurement
gaps.

For NR standalone UE configured with per-FR2 measurement gap,
measurement gap sharing shall be applied when UE requires measurement
gaps to identify and measure cells on FR2 intra-frequency carriers or
when SMTC configured for FR2 intra-frequency measurement are fully
overlapping with per-FR2 measurement gaps, and when UE requires
measurement gaps to identify and measure cells on FR2 inter-frequency
carriers for SSB based L3 measurement, or when all of SMTC configured
for inter-frequency SSB based measurement without measurement gaps are
fully overlapping with per-UE measurement gaps.

When network signals "01", "10" or "11" with RRC parameter
*MeasGapSharingScheme* \[2\] and the value of X is defined as in Table
9.1.2.1a-1, and

\- K~intra~ = 1 / X \* 100,

> \- K~inter~ = 1 / (100 -- X) \* 100,

### 9.1A.3 UE Measurement capability

#### 9.1A.3.1 SA: Monitoring of multiple layers using gaps

The requirements in this clause are applicable for UE configured with SA
NR operation mode.

When monitoring of multiple inter-RAT E-UTRAN carriers and
inter-frequency NR carriers with gaps(or without using gaps provided the
UE supports such capability or the effective MGRP is applied for per-FR
measurement gap capable UE) is configured by PCell, the UE shall be
capable of performing one measurement of the configured measurement type
(SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, SS-SINR, E-UTRAN RSRP, E-UTRAN RSRQ, E-UTRAN RS-SINR
measurements, etc.) of detected cells on all the layers.

For UE configured with the NR SA operation, the effective total number
of frequencies, excluding the frequencies of the PCell being monitored,
is N~freq,\ SA,\ RedCap~, which is defined as:

N~freq,\ SA,\ RedCap~ = N~freq,\ SA,\ NR,\ RedCap~ +
N~freq,\ SA,\ E-UTRA,\ RedCap~ ,

where

N~freq,\ SA,\ E-UTRA,\ RedCap~ is the number of E-UTRA inter-RAT
carriers being monitored (FDD and TDD) as configured by PCell,

N~freq,\ SA,\ NR,\ RedCap~ is the number of NR inter-frequency carriers
being monitored as configured by PCell.

#### 9.1A.3.2 SA: Maximum allowed layers for multiple monitoring

If a UE is configured with SA NR operation mode, the UE shall be capable
of monitoring at least:

\- Depending on UE capability, 6 NR SSB inter-frequency carriers
configured by PCell, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 6 E-UTRA TDD inter-RAT carriers
configured by PCell, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 6 E-UTRA FDD inter-RAT carriers
configured by PCell.

*In addition to the requirements defined above,* the UE shall be capable
of monitoring a total of at least \[10\] effective carrier frequency
layers comprising of any above defined combination of NR, E-UTRA FDD,
and E-UTRA TDD layers.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

### 9.1A.4 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria

#### 9.1A.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in
clause 9.1A.4.2, the UE shall meet all other performance requirements
defined in clause 9 and clause 10.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Each measurement identity
corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic reporting, or no
reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each measurement identity
is associated with an event triggering criterion. In case of periodic
reporting, a measurement identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.

#### 9.1A.4.2 Requirements

In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in
the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion
(in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case
of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of event,
with the same or different event identities, is counted as separate
reporting criterion in Table 9.1A.4.2-1.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to Table \[9.1A.4.2-1\]. For the
measurement categories belonging to intra-frequency, inter-frequency,
and inter-RAT measurements (i.e. without counting other categories that
the UE shall always support in parallel), the UE need not support more
than the total number of reporting criteria as follows:

\- For UE configured with SA operation mode: , where

is the total number of NR reporting criteria according to Table
9.1A.4.2-1,

is the total number of inter-RAT E-UTRA reporting criteria according to
Table 9.1A.4.2-1.

Table 9.1A.4.2-1: Requirements for reporting criteria per measurement
category

  ----------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Measurement category                                              E~cat~   Note
  Intra-frequency ^Note\ 1^                                         9        Events for any one or a combination of intra-frequency SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR for NG-RAN intra-frequency cells
  Inter-frequency ^Note\ 1^                                         10       Events for any one or a combination of inter-frequency SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINRfor NG-RAN inter-frequency cells

  NOTE 1: Applicable for UE configured with SA NR operation mode.            
  ----------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.1A.5 Carrier-specific scaling factor

This clause specifies the derivation of carrier-specific scaling factor
(CSSF) values, which scales the measurement delay requirements given in
clause 9.2B, 9.3Band 9.4A when UE is configured to monitor multiple
measurement objects. The CSSF values are categorized into
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ and CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~, for the
measurements conducted outside measurement gaps and within measurement
gaps, respectively.

#### 9.1A.5.1 Monitoring of multiple layers outside gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ for
measurement object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types:*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2B.5, when none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2B.5, when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3B.7, when none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap, if UE supports
*interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause \[9.3B.7\], when part of the SMTC occasions of this
inter-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the measurement
gap, if UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object *i*
only outside the measurement gaps.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps,
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ and requirements derived from
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ are not specified.

##### 9.1A.5.1.1 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based measurements performed outside gaps

For UE in SA operation mode, the carrier-specific scaling factor
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ for intra-frequency SSB-based measurements,
inter-frequency SSB-based measurements performed outside measurements
gaps, will be specified as follows:

CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ =1, if only one measurement object is configured to
be measured outside of MG for RedCap.

CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ =2 for intra-frequency measurement, and
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ = 2\*Y for inter-frequency measurement with no
measurement gap, Y is the number of configured inter-frequency MOs
without MG that are being measured outside of MG.

If intra-frequency measurement is with measurement gap,
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ = Y for inter-frequency measurement with no
measurement gap, Y is the number of configured inter-frequency MOs
without MG that are being measured outside of MG.

#### 9.1A.5.2 Monitoring of multiple layers within gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ for a
measurement object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types:*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with no measurement gap
in clause 9.2B.5, when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.2B.6.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.3B.4.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap
for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap* in clause 9.3B.7, when

-all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap, or

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap but the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is not configured by the Network-
E-UTRA Inter-RAT measurement object in clauses 9.4A.2 and 9.4A.3.

UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object *i*
only within the measurement gaps.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~
and requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ are not
specified.

##### 9.1A.5.2.1 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ and
is derived as described in this clause.

For each measurement gap *j* count the total number of intra-frequency
measurement object and inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects
which are candidates to be measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement object, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

\- M~intra\_RedCap,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects,
which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement
object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers and EUTRA
inter-RAT, which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise
M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~tot\_RedCap,i,j~ = M~intra\_RedCap,i,j~ + M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~ :
Total number of intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT frequncy
layers, which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot\_RedCap,i,j~
equals 0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is given
by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot\_RedCap,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(K~intra~×M~intra\_RedCap,i,j~) in gaps where
M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~≠0, where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(M~intra\_RedCap,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~=0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurement
object, CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(K~inter~×M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~) in gaps where
M~intra\_RedCap,i,j~ ≠0, where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra\_RedCap,i,j~=0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

### 9.1A.6 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within gaps or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

The carrier-specific scaling factor specified in clause 9.1A.5 that
applies to the other impacted measurement objects will also apply based
on the longer measurement or cell identification delay before or after
the transition.

When the UE transitions between DRX and non-DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements apply based on the longer delay before or after the
transition.

When the intra-frequency measurement transitions from measurements
performed on CD-SSB to measurements performed on NCD-SSB or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one cell identification period, the UE shall
use a cell identification period that is the maximum of the cell
identification periods corresponding to the first SSB type and the
second SSB type after the BWP switching.

When the intra-frequency measurement transitions from measurements
performed on CD-SSB to measurements performed on NCD-SSB or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one measurement period, the UE shall use a
measurement period that is the maximum of the measurement periods
corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after the
BWP switching.

When the measurement on one measurement object transitions from
inter-frequency measurement to intra-frequency measurement or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one cell identification period, the UE shall
use a cell identification period that is the maximum of the cell
identification periods corresponding to the first SSB type and the
second SSB type after the BWP switching.

When the measurement on one measurement object transitions from
inter-frequency measurement to intra-frequency measurement or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one measurement period, the UE shall use a
measurement period that is the maximum of the measurement periods
corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after the
BWP switching .

Subsequent to the above-mentioned measurement periods and/or cell
identification periods, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements on each measurement object are based on the SSB type after
the BWP switch.

9.1C General measurement requirement for SAN
--------------------------------------------

### 9.1C.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements are
split in intra-frequency, inter-frequency and L1-RSRP measurements
requirements. These measurements may be used by the NG-RAN. The
measurement quantities are defined in TS38.215 \[4\], the measurement
model is defined in TS38.300 \[10\], TS37.340 \[17\] and measurement
accuracies are specified in clause 10. Control of measurement reporting
is specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.1C.2 Measurement gap

For the UE configured with only PCell, which is served by SAN, if the UE
requires measurement gaps to identify and measure cells operating in
satellite access network and/or TN cells, in order for the requirements
in the following clauses to apply the network must provide at least one
per-UE measurement gap and the number of per-UE measurement gaps
provided by the network must not exceed the number of measurement gaps
supported by the UE, indicated by the capability
*parallelMeasurementGap*.

During the per-UE measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the PCell
except the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s) and the
signals used for random access procedure according to \[7\].

UEs shall support the measurement gap patterns listed in Table 9.1C.2-1.
UE determines measurement gap timing based on gap offset configuration
and measurement gap timing advance configuration provided by higher
layer signalling as specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

\(a\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0ms for
NR standalone operation configured with only single carrier

\(b\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0.5ms
for NR standalone operation configured with only single carrier

Figure 9.1C.2-1: Measurement GAP and total interruption time for NR
standalone operation confgigured with only single carrier

In determining the measurement gap starting point, UE shall use the DL
timing of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap. If per-UE measurement gap is configured with
MG timing advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~
ms advanced to the end of the latest subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap. T~MG~ is the MG timing advance
value provided in *mgta* according to \[2\].

The corresponding total number of DL interrupted slots on PCell is
listed in Table 9.1C.2-2 for NR standalone configured with only single
carrier.

UL slots that are fully or partially overlapping with measurement gap,
taking into account TA as defined in clause 7.1C.2, are interrupted.

Note: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

### 9.1C.8 Concurrent measurement gaps for SAN

#### 9.1C.8.1 Introduction

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap pattern capability, network
can provide multiple measurement gaps configured by RRC message(s) as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

#### 9.1C.8.2 Requirements

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells, and the UE supports
concurrent measurement gap patterns (*parallelMeasurementGap*), in order
for the requirements in the following clauses to apply the network can
provide at most two per-UE measurement gap patterns for monitoring of
all frequency layers.

For UE configured with the SA operation, when monitoring of multiple
intra-frequency and inter-frequency NR carrier frequency layers as
configured by PCell using gaps, each monitored carrier frequency layer,
including *following measurement types:*

\- a measurement object with SSB based measurement,

can be associated to one or two measurement gap pattern provided the
network configures the concurrent measurement gap patterns.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns, each measurement
gap pattern supported by the UE is listed in Table 9.1C.2-1.

The requirements in clause 9.1C.2 are also applicable for the UE capable
of and configured with multiple concurrent measurement gap patterns
within each measurement gap pattern.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns and configured with
more than 1 per-UE measurement gap patterns, requirements do not apply
if the UE is configured with more than one measurement gap pattern (MGP)
with measurement gap repetition period (MGRP) of 20ms.

#### 9.1C.8.3 Collision between concurrent measurement gaps

Collisions between occasions of two concurrent measurement gaps may
occur as specified in this clause if the two measurement gaps are

\- two per-UE measurement gaps, or

When UE is configured with concurrent measurement gaps, two measurement
gap occasions are considered colliding if at least one of the following
conditions is met:

\- the two occasions are fully or partially overlapping in time domain,
or

\- the distance between the two occasions is equal to or smaller than
4ms.

The distance between two measurement gap occasions is defined as the
time difference between the ending point of the first occasion and the
starting point of the second occasion, where the first measurement gap
occasion occurs earlier in time than the second measurement gap
occasion.

If two colliding measurement gaps are not fully overlapping, in case of
collision between two measurement gap occasions, the UE shall perform
measurements in the occasion of the measurement gap with higher
priority, and the occasion of the measurement gap with lower priority
shall be dropped. The UE shall be able to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or
receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI in the corresponding NR serving
cells in the slots that are not interrupted according to requirements in
clause 9.1C.8.4.

If two colliding measurement gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP=160ms,
in case of collision between two measurement gap occasions, the UE shall
perform measurements in the occasion of one of the measurement gaps, and
it is up to UE implementation which occasion is used for measurement,
provided that UE can meet the requirements in clause 9.2C and 9.3C.

If two measurement gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP\<160ms, no
measurement requirements apply.

#### 9.1C.8.4 Measurement gap related requirements of concurrent measurement gaps

A slot is considered as interrupted if it is interrupted by an occasion
of any of the configured concurrent measurement gaps following the
measurement gap interruption requirements in clause 9.1C.2, except for a
dropped measurement gap occasion.

### 9.1C.9 Collision between SMTC and measurement gap for SAN

#### 9.1C.9.1 Introduction

This clause contains definition of collision between SMTCs and
measurement gap for SAN.

#### 9.1C.9.2 Collision between SMTCs and measurement gap

Collision between occasions of SMTC and measurement gap may occur as
specified in this clause.

When UE is configured with one or more than one measurement gap pattern,
an SMTC occasion outside measurement gap and a measurement gap occasion
are considered colliding if at least one of the following conditions is
met:

\- the SMTC occasion is fully or partially overlapping in time domain
with the measurement gap occasion, or

\- the magnitude of the distance between the SMTC occasion and the
measurement gap occasion in time domain is less than or equals to 4ms.

The distance between a SMTC occasion and a measurement gap occasion is
defined as:

\- the time difference between the ending point of the SMTC occasion and
the starting point of the measurement gap occasion, where the SMTC
occasion occurs earlier in time than the MG occasion, or

\- the time difference between the ending point of the measurement gap
occasion and the starting point of the SMTC occasion, where the
measurement gap occasion occurs earlier in time than the SMTC occasion.

#### 9.1C.9.3 Collision between multiple SMTCs on a SAN carrier

Collision between occasions of multiple SMTCs may occur as specified in
this clause.

When UE is configured with more than one SMTC on a SAN carrier, two SMTC
occasions outside measurement gap are considered colliding if at least
one of the following conditions is met:

> \- the two SMTC occasions are fully or partially overlapping in time
> domain, or
>
> \- the magnitude of the distance between two SMTC occasions in time
> domain is less than or equals to 4 ms.

The distance between two SMTC occasions is defined as the time
difference between the ending point of the earlier SMTC occasion and the
starting point of the later SMTC occasion.

9.2 NR intra-frequency measurements
-----------------------------------

### 9.2.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or the
PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement, or

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP\[3\].

Besides the conditions listed above,

for UE supporting nr-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17 and indicating
NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR for intra-frequency measurement,

> \- An intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement
> without gap if

\- the UE indicates 'nogap-noncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
intra-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- the active downlink BWP is not an initial BWP \[3\].

An intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with NCSG
if

\- the UE indicates 'ncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
intra-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- the active downlink BWP is not an initial BWP \[3\]

\- An intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap
if

> \- the UE indicates 'gap' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
> intra-frequency measurement, and
>
> \- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE,
> and
>
> \- the active downlink BWP is not an initial BWP \[3\]

\- The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurement
corresponding to a deactivated SCell or dormant SCell with NCSG.

\- For intra-frequency SSB based measurements with NCSG, UE may cause
scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2.7.3.

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2.5.3.SSB
based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ which start earlier than the gap starting time
+ switching time, nor detect SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which end
later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching time is 0.5ms for
frequency range FR1 and 0.25ms for frequency range FR2.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

The measurement requirements defined for an activated SCell with a
non-dormant active BWP defined in this clause shall also apply to an
activated SCell with dormant BWP as active BWP.

*Editor Note: FFS the scenario when deactivated SCell measurement object
is fully overlapping with measurement gap*

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2.5 applies for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

> \- When [none]{.underline} of the SMTC occasions of this
> intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the union of
> concurrent measurement gaps.
>
> \- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

> \- when [none]{.underline} of the SMTC occasions of this
> intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the measurement
> gap.
>
> \- when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2.6 applies for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with measurement gap,

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap with
the following condition,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

> \- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap in the
> concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
> SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are
> overlapped with the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

> \- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with NCSG, and measurement gap
is configured.

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2.7 applies for
the following scenarios:

-   SSB based intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
    corresponding to an activated serving cell, when all of the SMTC
    occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped
    by the NCSG;

-   SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object corresponding to an
    activated serving cell (in non-dormancy) when UE supports
    nr-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17 and indicates 'ncsg' in
    NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR for intra-frequency measurement and all or
    part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
    object are overlapped by the NCSG;

SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object corresponding to a
deactivated serving cell or to an activated serving cell in dormancy
when all or part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the NCSG.

### 9.2.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2 apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2 and 10.1.3
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7 and 10.1.8
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12 and 10.1.13
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
Band.

### 9.2.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell (except for the
SCell) is not smaller than the number of configured RLM-RS SSB
resources.

#### 9.2.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For one single intra-frequency layer in a band, during each layer 1
measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP,
SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 6 identified cells, and

\- 24 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI,

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC when UE is configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the
band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with EN-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with NR-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- One of the SCCs on which UE is configured to report SSB based
measurements when neither PCC nor PSCC is in the same band, so that the
selected SCC shall be an SCC where the UE is configured with SS-RSRP
measurement reporting if such SCC exists, otherwise the selected SCC is
determined by UE implementation.

The UE shall also be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least 2 SSBs on serving cell for each of the other
intra-frequency layer(s) in the same band.

### 9.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodic
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.2.1
(RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for FR1),
10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1
(RS-SINR for FR2).

#### 9.2.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1
(RSRQ for FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and
10.1.13.1 (RS-SINR for FR2).

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2.4.3.

#### 9.2.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for
FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1
(RS-SINR for FR2).

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ intra\ with\ index~ or T
~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause
9.2.6.2 or clause 9.2.7.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay
can be expected. In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured
to perform E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be
expected in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional
delay can be expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of
per-FR gap.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2 or clause 9.2.7.1. If a cell
which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ or T~identify\ intra\ with\ index~
defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2 or clause 9.2.7.1 becomes
undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes
detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and triggers
an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less
than T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap
has not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is
the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected. In EN-DC and
NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform E-UTRA SRS
carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected in FR1 if
the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be expected
in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

### 9.2.5 Intrafrequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2.5.1 Intrafrequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if the UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~. The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It is assumed
that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2
with SCS smaller or equal to 480 kHz.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2.5.1-1, 9.2.5.1-2, 9.2.5.1-4 (CC with deactivated

\- For UE supporting power class 6 with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*
configured, if SMTC \<= 40ms, T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ is given in Table
9.2.5.1-11; otherwise, T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ is given in Table
9.2.5.1-2.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2.5.1-3, 9.2.5.1-15
(FR2-2), 9.2.5.1-6 (CC with deactivated SCell), 9.2.5.1-10 (CC with
deactivated SCell) or 9.2.5.1-14 (CC with deactivated PSCell).

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.2.5.2-1, table 9.2.5.2-2 table

(CC with deactivated PSCell) or 9.2.5.2-9 (CC with deactivated PSCell).

\- For UE supporting power class 6 with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*
configured, if SMTC \<= 40ms, T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is
given in Table 9.2.5.2-7; otherwise, T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~
is given in Table 9.2.5.2-2.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully non overlapping or partially overlapping with GAP.

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, an SMTC occasion is only considered to be
overlapped by Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

if the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise
the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions corresponds to
the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~: For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 1 or
5, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ =40. For a UE supporting power class 2,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class
3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power
class 4, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2-1
power class 6, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ = 24. For a UE supporting
FR2-2 power class 1, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ = 60. For a UE
supporting FR2-2 power class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ = 36. For a
UE supporting FR2-2 power class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps~ = 36.

M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~: For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 1 or
5, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =40. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class
2, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class
3, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 4,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 6,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ = 24. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
1, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 2, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ = 36. For a UE supporting FR2-2
power class 3, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ = 36.

M~SSB\_index\_intra~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 72 samples. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
2, M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 48 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 3, M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 48 samples.

> When UE supports concurrentMeasGap-r17 and is configured with

> Kp is the scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured

> \- Ntotal is the total number of SMTC occasions within the window,

\- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are not overlapped
with any non-dropped MG occasion within the window W, after accounting
for measurement gap collisions by applying the measurement gap collision
rule in section 9.1.8.3.

K~p~ = 1 when N~available~ = 0.

> Otherwise, when UE is not configured with or UE does not support
> concurrent measurement gaps:

When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with GAP, Kp=1

When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, Kp = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. When
intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with NCSG, Kp = 1/(1-
(SMTC period /VIRP)), where SMTC period \< VIRP. For calculation of Kp,
if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\]) of *smtc2* is configured,
for cells indicated in the *pci-List* parameter in *smtc2*, the SMTC
periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*;
for the other cells, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1.* If the higher layer signaling in
TS38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present and smtc1 is fully
overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2 is partially overlapping
with measurement gaps, requirements are not specified for
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~

For FR2,

> Klayer1\_measurement=1,
>
> \- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
> L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same
> band outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by

>
> \- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or

> indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;
>
> Klayer1\_measurement=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

If MCG DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in Table 9.2.5.1-1,
Table 9.2.5.1-2, Table 9.2.5.1-3, Table 9.2.5.1-4, Table 9.2.5.1-5 and
Table 9.2.5.1-6 shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use,
cell identification requirements for intra-frequency measurement in SCG

9.2.5.1-13 and Table 9.2.5.1-14 shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle.
Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use shall apply.

#### 9.2.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2.5.2-1, 9.2.5.2-2, 9.2.5.2-3 (CC with deactivated
SCell), 9.2.5.2-4 (CC with deactivated SCell), 9.2.5.2-8 (deactivated
SCG applicable for PSCell) or 9.2.5.2-9 (deactivated SCG applicable for
PSCell). When *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured, T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is specified in Table 9.2.5.2-5.

If the higher layer signaling in TS38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2
is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, an SMTC occasion is only considered to be
overlapped by Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

If MCG DRX is in use, measurement period requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in Table 9.2.5.2-1, Table
9.2.5.2-2, Table 9.2.5.2-3 and Table 9.2.5.2-4 shall depend on the MCG
DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, measurement period requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in SCG specified in Table 9.2.5.2-1, Table
9.2.5.2-2, Table 9.2.5.2-3, Table 9.2.5.2-4, Table 9.2.5.2-8 and Table
9.2.5.2-9, shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the
requirements for when DRX is not in use shall apply.

For FR2, a longer measurement period is allowed, if aperiodic CSI-RS
resource is measured for L1-RSRP measurement on any FR2 serving
frequency in the same band, and the CSI-RS resource is outside
measurement gap and overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols. If *SSB-ToMeasure* or *SS-RSSI-Measurement* is configured, the
SSB symbols are indicated by the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects on the same band which can be merged
and the RSSI symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*.

#### 9.2.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

UE shall be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the SSB
is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When any
of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of SSB-ToMeasure from all the configured measurement objects on the
same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, the requirements in 9.2.5.3 also apply
when a Pre-MG is deactivated.

For UE supporting concurrent measurement gaps, when concurrent gaps are
configured, the requirements in 9.2.5.3 are also applied to the slots
that are not interrupted according to requirements in clause 9.1.8.3.

##### 9.2.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to
be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to
be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer in TS 38.331
\[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is configured, the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to
be measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration.
If the high layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331
\[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1.*

When TDD intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

When TDD inter-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to another serving
cell in a different band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols, if UE does not have the
capability of supporting *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this band
pair.

##### 9.2.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*

SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

If the following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

The UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH
CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.2.5.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR
measurement on an FR2 intra-frequency cell

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled and the SCS of data and
SSB symbols are smaller than 960kHz, the UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols
within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled and the SCS of data or
SSB symbols is 960kHz, the UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI SSB symbols to
be measured, and on K' data symbol(s) before each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured and K' data symbol(s) after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration.

The following scheduling restriction applies to SS-RSRQ measurement on
an FR2 intra-frequency cell

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to

SSB symbols to be measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on K data
symbol(s) before each consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and K
data symbol(s) after each consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols

RSSI measurement symbols, and on K' data symbol(s) before each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and K' data symbol(s) after
each consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window
duration.

where

\- If the high layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331
\[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1.*

\- The signaling *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR2-1
and FR2-2 when SSB is using 120 kHz SCS and 480 kHz SCS.

\- K=1 for a serving cell with data symbols of 120 kHz SCS

\- K=4 for a serving cell with data symbols of 480 kHz SCS and SSB

symbols of 960kHz SCS

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ or SS-SINR measurement on an FR2 intra-frequency cell
in different bands, provided that UE is capable of independent beam
management on this FR2 band pair. Additionally, there is no scheduling
restriction if the UE is configured with different numerology between
SSB on one FR2 band and data on the other FR2 band provided the UE is
configured for IBM operation for the band pair.

Note: When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the
scheduling restrictions as defined in clause 9.2.5.3.1 due to a given
serving cell also apply to another serving cell in a different FR2 band
on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the aforementioned
restricted symbols, if UE does not have the capability of supporting
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this FR2 band pair.

If following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the

set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, the
UE shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that the UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured.

##### 9.2.5.3.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR2 serving cell frequency layer. However, the
scheduling restrictions as defined in clause 9.2.5.3.1 due to a given
serving cell in FR2 also apply to another serving cell in an FR1 band on
the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the aforementioned
restricted symbols, if UE does not have the capability of supporting
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this FR1-FR2 band pair.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR1 serving cell frequency layer. However, the
scheduling restrictions as defined in clause 9.2.5.3.1 due to a given
serving cell in FR1 also apply to another serving cell in an FR2 band on
the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the aforementioned
restricted symbols, if UE does not have the capability of supporting
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this FR1-FR2 band pair.

#### 9.2.5.4 SFTD Measurements between PCell and PSCell

##### 9.2.5.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains SFTD measurement requirements for UE which supports
NR-DC and is configured with a PSCell in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The UE
shall perform SFTD measurement between PCell and PSCell, and report the
SFTD result with/without SS-RSRP after the network requests with
*reportType* for the associated *reportConfig* set to *reportSFTD*. The
overall delay includes RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\], and SFTD measurement reporting delay in clause
9.2.5.4.3..

##### 9.2.5.4.2 SFTD Measurement delay

When no DRX is used in either of PCell and PSCell, the physical layer
measurement period of the SFTD measurement shall be T~measure\_SFTD1~ =
max(200, 5 x SMTC period) ms, where the SMTC period refers to the
maximum between the configured SMTC period in PCell and PSCell.

When DRX is used in either of the PCell or the PSCell, or in both PCell
and PSCell, the physical layer measurement period (T~measure\_SFTD1~) of
the SFTD measurement shall be as specified in Table 9.2.5.4.2-1.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If PSCell is changed without changing carrier frequency of PSCell, while
the UE is performing SFTD measurements, the UE shall still meet SFTD
measurement and accuracy requirements for the new PSCell. In this case
the UE shall restart the SFTD measurement, and the total physical layer
measurement period shall not exceed T~measure\_SFTD2~ as defined by the
following expression:

T~measure\_SFTD2~ = (M+1)\*(T~measure\_SFTD1~) +
M\*T~PSCell\_change\_NRDC~

where:

M is the number of times the NR PSCell is changed over the measurement
period (T~measure\_SFTD2~), and

T~PSCell\_change\_NRDC~ is the time necessary to change the PSCell; it
can be up to 25ms.

If PCell is changed, or if PSCell is changed with different carrier
frequency from PSCell, the UE shall terminate SFTD measurements.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement when DRX is used as
well as when no DRX is used shall be as specified in the clause 10.1.21.

##### 9.2.5.4.3 SFTD Measurement Reporting Delay

*The SFTD measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between a
command that will trigger an SFTD measurement report and the point when
the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface.* This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This measurement reporting delay excludes any delay
caused by no UL resources available for UE to send the measurement
report.

The SFTD measurement reporting delay shall be less than measurement
period defined in clause 9.2.5.4.2 plus the RRC procedure delay defined
in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.2.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2.6.1 Void

#### 9.2.6.2 Intra-frequency cell identification

When a measurement gap is provided or an activated Pre-MG is provided
without any pre-MG status changed during the measurement period, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It is assumed
that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2
with SCS smaller or equal to 480 kHz.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2.6.2-1, 9.2.6.2-2 or 9.2.6.2-9.

\- For UE supporting power class 6 with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*
configured, if SMTC \<= 40ms, T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ is given in Table

given in Table 9.2.6.3-4; otherwise, T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~
is given in Table 9.2.6.3-2.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement
gap and per-FR measurement gap within the same FR as the SSB frequency
layer, and starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other measurement gap occasions
within the window**, and**

**- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap **within the
window W after accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the
measurement gap collision rule in section 9.1.8.3.**

When concurrent measurement gaps are configured, requirements in this
clause do not apply if N~available~ =0.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_with\_gaps~ : For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 1
or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~=40. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power

FR2-1 power class 4, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a UE
supporting FR2-1 power class 6, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ = 24 For a
UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ = 60.
For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ =
36. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 3,
M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ = 36.

For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2, M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ =
36. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 3,
M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ = 36.

\- M~SSB\_index\_intra~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 72. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2,
M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 48. For a UE supporting FR2 power class 3,
M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 48.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2 is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~

If MCG DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in Table 9.2.6.2-1, Table
9.2.6.2-2, and Table 9.2.6.2-3 shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG
DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for intra-frequency
measurement in SCG specified in Table 9.2.6.2-1, Table 9.2.6.2-2, and
Table 9.2.6.2-3 shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the
requirements for when DRX is not in use shall apply.

#### 9.2.6.3 Intrafrequency Measurement Period

The requirements in this clause apply when a measurement gap is provided
or when an activated Pre-MG is provided without any pre-MG status
changed during the measurement period.

The measurement period for FR1 intrafrequency measurements with gaps is
as shown in table 9.2.6.3-1.

The measurement period for FR2 intrafrequency measurements with gaps is
as shown in table 9.2.6.3-2.

When *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured, T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is specified in Table 9.2.6.3-3.

If MCG DRX is in use, measurement period requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in Table 9.2.6.3-1 and
Table 9.2.6.3-2, shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in
use, measurement period requirements for intra-frequency measurement in
SCG specified in Table 9.2.6.3-1and Table 9.2.6.3-2, shall depend on the
SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use
shall apply.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer measurement period would
be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested
to decode an NR CGI.

### 9.2.7 Intra-frequency measurements with NCSG

#### 9.2.7.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

For the UE supporting NCSG, if NCSG is provided, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable intra frequency cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It is assumed
that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2.7.1-1, 9.2.7.1-2, 9.2.7.1-4 (deactivated Scell) or
9.2.7.1-5 (deactivated Scell).

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2.7.1-3 or 9.2.7.1-6
(deactivated Scell).

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.2.7.2-1, 9.2.7.2-2, 9.2.7.2-3,
9.2.7.2-4 (deactivated Scell) or 9.2.7.2-5 (deactivated Scell).

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

#### 9.2.7.3 Scheduling availability during intra-frequency measurement with NCSG

Scheduling availability specified in 9.2.5.3 applies to scheduling

9.2A NR intra-frequency measurements with CCA
---------------------------------------------

### 9.2A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.2.A apply for intra-frequency measurements
on carrier frequency with CCA.

When the intra-frequency measurement is performed on a neighbour cell in
FR2-2 with shared spectrum channel access, UE shall determine the CCA
mode of the neighbour cell according to *channelAccessMode2-r17*of the
cell configured in *MeasObjectNR*. If *channelAccessMode2-r17* of the
cell is enabled, UE shall assume that CCA applies to the cell and
perform measurement accordingly, and the requirements in clause 9.2A
shall apply; otherwise, UE shall assume that CCA does not apply to the
cell and perform measurement accordingly, and requirements in 9.2 shall
apply.

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or the
PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP\[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2A.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching
time is 0.5ms for frequency range FR1 and 0.25 ms for frequency range
FR2-2.

In the requirements of clause 9.2A, the term SMTC occasion not available
at the UE refers to when the SMTC contains SSBs configured by gNB in a
cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but *N~SSB~* candidate SSB
positions for the same SSB index within the discovery burst transmission
window are not available at the UE due to DL CCA failures at gNB during
the corresponding period, where:

\- For the cell detection procedure: *N~SSB~* is at least one candidate
SSB position (NOTE: the one candidate SSB position for the cell
detection shall not be impacted by the set of candidate SSB positions
which are already being measured by the UE within the current
measurement period of the on-going measurements), and

\- For other procedures in clause 9.2A: *N~SSB~* are the first two
successive candidate SSB positions when two or more candidate SSB
positions are configured for this SSB index in one discovery burst
transmission window, otherwise *N~SSB~* is one candidate SSB position;

otherwise the SMTC occasion is considered as available at the UE.

For the FR2-2 requirements of clause 9.2A, an SMTC occasion group
consists of N consecutive SMTC occasions, where N is the UE Rx beam
sweeping scaling factor. An SMTC occasion group is not available, when
at least one SMTC occasion in the group is not transmitted by the gNB.

### 9.2A.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2A apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.27 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clause 10.1.29 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clause 10.1.31 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding
Band.

### 9.2A.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2A.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell (except for the
SCell) is not smaller than the number of configured RLM-RS SSB
resources.

#### 9.2A.3.2 Requirements for FR2-2

For one single intra-frequency layer in a band, during each layer 1
measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP,
SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 6 identified cells, and

\- 24 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI,

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC when UE is configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the
band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with NR-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- One of the SCCs on which UE is configured to report SSB based
measurements when neither PCC nor PSCC is in the same band, so that the
selected SCC shall be an SCC where the UE is configured with SS-RSRP
measurement reporting if such SCC exists, otherwise the selected SCC is
determined by UE implementation.

The UE shall also be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least 2 SSBs on serving cell for each of the other
intra-frequency layer(s) in the same band.

### 9.2A.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

9.2A.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodically
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1. 36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2),10.1.29(RSRQ for FR1), TBD
(RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD (RS-SINR for FR2-2),
respectively.

9.2A.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodically
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2), 10.1.29 (RSRQ for FR1),
TBD (RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD (RS-SINR for
FR2-2) , respectively.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2A.4.3.

9.2A.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodically
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2), 10.1.29 (RSRQ for FR1),
TBD (RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD (RS-SINR for
FR2-2), respectively.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on, and
all delays due to UL CCA failures until the successful transmission of
the report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_CCA~ or T
~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_CCA~ defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or
clause 9.2A.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period T
~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ or T
~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA~ as defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or
clause 9.2A.6.2. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the
time period T ~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_CCA~ or T
~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_CCA~ defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or clause
9.2A.6.2 becomes undetectable for a period≤ 8 seconds and then the cell
becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and
triggers an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ provided the timing
to that cell has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ Tc while the
measurement gap has not been available and the L3 filter has not been
used, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS
38.211 \[3\]. When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be
expected.

### 9.2A.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

9.2A.5.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA~. The UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an
already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\ CCA~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2A.5.1-1, 9.2A.5.1-3 (deactivated Scell) .

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2A.5.1-2 or
9.2A.5.1-4 (deactivated SCell).

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~: equal to a measurement period
of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2A.5.2-1, 9.2A.5.2-2
(deactivated Scell). CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling
factor and is determined

\- according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully non overlapping or partially overlapping with measurement gaps, or
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

\- M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 1, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting
FR2-2 power class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE
supporting FR2-2 power class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

\- M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 1, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2
power class 2, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE supporting
FR2-2 power class 3, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

\- M~SSB\_index\_intra\_CCA:~ For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 72 samples. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 2, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 3, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples.

N: is the UE Rx beam sweeping scaling factor. N = 12.

When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, Kp=1

When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurent gaps,
Kp = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP.

For FR2-2,

K~layer1\_measurement~=TBD

If MCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification requirements
specified in Table 9.2A.5.1-1, Table 9.2A.5.1-2, Table 9.2A.5.1-3, Table
9.2A.5.1-4, Table 9.2A.5.1-5 and Table 9.2A.5.1-6 shall depend on the
MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification
requirements specified in Table 9.2A.5.1-1, Table 9.2A.5.1-2, Table
9.2A.5.1-3, Table 9.2A.5.1-4, Table 9.2A.5.1-5 and Table 9.2A.5.1-6
shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when
DRX is not in use shall apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

#### 9.2A.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2A.5.2-1, 9.2A.5.2-2 (deactivated SCell).

If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency measurement period requirements
specified in Table 9.2A.5.2-1, Table 9.2A.5.2-2 shall depend on the SCG
DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use shall
apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

When the time period of unsuccessful measurement attempts due to
exceeding the maximum number of unavailable at the UE SMTC occasions of
an already identified cell exceeds the maximum time requirement for the
cell to remain known defined in clause 9.2A.4.3, UE shall stop the
measurement attempts on this SSB and ***perform the detection procedure
again like for any other SSB***.

#### 9.2A.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

UE shall be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the SSB
is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When any
of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on
the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within SMTC window duration defined in
clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

##### 9.2A.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols
configured to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols configured to be measured and 1 data symbol after each
consecutive SSB symbols configured to be measured within SMTC window
duration if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled. If the high layer in
TS 38.331\[2\] signaling of smtc2 is configured, the SMTC periodicity
follows smtc2; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows smtc1.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols
within SMTC window duration if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled.
If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of smtc2 is configured,
the SMTC periodicity follows smtc2; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows
smtc1.

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols
configured to be measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data
symbol before each consecutive SSB configured to be measured/RSSI
symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB configured to be
measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled. If the high layer signaling of
smtc2 is configured (in TS 38.331), the SMTC periodicity follows smtc2;
Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows smtc1.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols
within SMTC window duration if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled.
If the high layer in TS 38.331 signaling of smtc2 is configured, the
SMTC periodicity follows smtc2; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows
smtc1.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in unlicensed spectrum is performed,
the scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to
all other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.2A.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.2A.5.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR2-2

The requirements in clause 9.2.5.3.3 apply.

### 9.2A.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2A.6.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA.~ The UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an
already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\ CCA.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\ CCA~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~ +
T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2A.6.1-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2A.6.1-2.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~: equal to a measurement period
of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2A.6.2-1 or 9.2A.6.1-3.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
1, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2
power class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE
supporting FR2-2 power class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
1, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 2, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE supporting FR2-2
power class 3, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

\- M~SSB\_index\_intra\_CCA:~ For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 72 samples. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 2, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 3, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples.

N: is the UE Rx beam sweeping scaling factor. N = 12.

If MCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification requirements

shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency
cell identification requirements specified in Table 9.2A.6.1-1, Table
9.2A.6.1-2 and Table 9.2A.6.1-3 shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle.
Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use shall apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

#### 9.2A.6.2 Intra-frequency Measurement Period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements with gaps is as
shown in table 9.2A.6.2-1.

If MCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification requirements
specified in Table 9.2A.6.2-1 and 9.2A.6.2-2 shall depend on the MCG DRX
cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency measurement period
requirements specified in Table 9.2A.6.2-1 and 9.2A.6.2-2 shall depend
on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in
use shall apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

When the time period of unsuccessful measurement attempts due to
exceeding the maximum number of unavailable at the UE SMTC occasions of
an already identified cell exceeds the maximum time requirement for the
cell to remain known defined in clause 9.2A.4.3, UE shall stop the
measurement attempts on this SSB and perform the detection procedure
again like for any other SSB.

### 9.2A.7 Intra-frequency RSSI and Channel occupancy measurements

#### 9.2A.7.1 Intra-frequency RSSI measurements

An RSSI measurement is defined as an intra-frequency measurement
provided that the RSSI measurement bandwidth is fully contained within
the current carrier bandwidth of the UE.

The UE physical layer shall be capable of performing the RSSI
measurements, defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] on one or more serving carriers
operating with CCA, TS 37.213 \[33\], if the carrier(s) are indicated by
higher layers \[2\], and report the RSSI measurements to higher layers.
The UE physical layer shall provide to higher layers a single RSSI
sample for each OFDM symbol within each configured RSSI measurement
duration \[2\] occurring with a configured RSSI measurement timing
configuration periodicity \[2\], *rmtc-Periodicity*.

The UE can perform RSSI measurements without measurement gaps if RSSI
measurement bandwidth is fully within the active DL BWP of the UE.

For performing intra-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2, UE shall
assume the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD
to the DL RS associated with the TCI state provided in the RMTC
configuration. UE does not expect to be configured with an explicit
TCI-state in RMTC-Config with a reference serving cell in FR1 or FR2-1.
If no TCI state is provided in the RMTC configuration, UE shall assume
the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD to one
of the latest received PDSCH and the latest monitored CORESET in the
active BWP of the current carrier in FR2-2.

For RSSI measurement in FR2-2 with SCS of 480 kHz or 960 kHz, the RSSI
measurement results shall be derived based on symbols configured by RMTC
except for the first symbol and the last symbol in RMTC, and there is no
requirement when *measDurationSymbols* is configured as 1.

The measurement period for intra-frequency RSSI measurements without
measurement gaps is as shown in Table 9.2A.7.1-1 and Table 9.2A.7.1-2,
for FR1, and in Table 9.2A.7.4-1 and Table 9.2A.7.5-1 for FR2-2. The
measurement period for intra-frequency RSSI measurements with
measurement gaps is as shown in Table 9.2A.7.1-3, for FR1 and in Table
9.2A.7.1-6 for FR2-2.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform intra-frequency
measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent intra-frequency measurements, including intra-frequency RSSI
measurements. The RSSI measurement duration and the measurement gap
shall be aligned, and the following additional condition shall be
fulfilled:

\- Entire RSSI measurement duration is contained in the measurement gap.

The RSSI measurement performed and reported according to this clause
shall meet the RSSI measurement accuracy requirement in Clause
10.1.34.1. The reported RSSI measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in Clause 10.1.34.3.

#### 9.2A.7.2 Intra-frequency Channel occupancy measurements

The UE shall be capable of estimating the channel occupancy on one or
more serving carrier frequencies indicated by higher layers \[2\], based
on RSSI samples provided by the physical layer.

The UE can perform channel occupancy measurements without measurement
gaps if RSSI measurement bandwidth is fully within the active DL BWP of
the UE.

The measurement period for intra-frequency channel occupancy
measurements without measurement gap is as shown in Table 9.2A.7.2-1 and
Table 9.2A.7.1-2 for FR1, and in Table 9.2A.7.2-4 and Table 9.2A.7.1-5
for FR2-2. The measurement period for intra-frequency RSSI measurements
with measurement gaps is as shown in Table 9.2A.7.2-3 for FR1, and in
Table 9.2A.7.2-6 for FR2-2 .

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform intra-frequency
measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent intra-frequency measurements, including intra-frequency RSSI
measurements. The RSSI measurement duration and the measurement gap
shall be aligned, and the following additional condition shall be
fulfilled:

\- Entire RSSI measurement duration is contained in the measurement gap.

The channel occupancy measurement performed and reported according to
this clause shall meet the channel occupancy measurement accuracy
requirements in Clause 10.1.35.1. The reported channel occupancy
measurement values contained in measurement reports shall be based on
the measurement reporting range specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

#### 9.2A.7.3 Scheduling restriction during RSSI and Channel Occupancy measurements in FR1

When the UE performs intra-frequency RSSI/CO measurements in unlicensed
spectrum, the following restrictions apply due to RSSI/CO measurements:

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on UL symbols
which are overlapping in time with the RSSI measurement symbols
configured by RMTC.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in unlicensed spectrum is performed,
the scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to
all other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

#### 9.2A.7.4 Scheduling restriction during RSSI measurements in FR2-2

When the UE performs intra-frequency RSSI measurements in unlicensed
spectrum, the following restrictions apply due to RSSI measurements:

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on UL symbols
which are overlapping in time with the RSSI measurement symbols
configured by RMTC.

\- The UE is not expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
symbols which are overlapping in time with RSSI measurement symbols
configured by RMTC if the RSSI measurement resources are not QCL-ed with
typeD to the DL RS in the active TCI state of PDCCH/PDSCH.

\- For 480 kHz and 960 kHz, The UE is not expected to receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols which are overlapping in time
with the first and last RSSI measurement symbols configured by RMTC.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in unlicensed spectrum is performed,
the scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to
all other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

9.2B NR intra-frequency measurements for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------

### 9.2B.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the reference SSB of the serving cell
and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour cell are the same,
and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also the same. The
reference SSB is the **SSB defined in BWP-specific *servingCellMO* under
*BWP-DownlinkDedicated* of active DL BWP. If the field is absent,** the
reference SSB is the SSB defined in *servingCellMO* under
*ServingCellConfig \[2\]***.**

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP \[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2B.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching
time is 0.5ms for frequency range FR1 and 0.25ms for frequency range
FR2.

### 9.2B.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2B apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

> \- For 2Rx RedCap:
>
> \- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2 and 10.1.3
> for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7 and 10.1.8
> for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12 and
> 10.1.13 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
> Band.
>
> \- For 1Rx RedCap:
>
> \- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.2 for FR1for
> a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.2 for FR1
> for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.2 for FR1
> for a corresponding Band,
>
> \- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.15 for a
> corresponding Band.

### 9.2B.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2B.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell is not smaller than
the number of configured RLM-RS SSB resources.

#### 9.2B.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For one single intra-frequency layer in a band, during each layer 1
measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP,
SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 6 identified cells, and

\- 24 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI,

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC when UE is configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the
band.

### 9.2B.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2B.4.1 Periodic Reporting

For 2Rx RedCap: The requirements in clause 9.2.4.1 shall apply.

For 1Rx RedCap: Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1A.2.1 (SS-RSRP for FR1), 10.1A.6.1 (SS-RSRQ for FR1) and
10.1A.10.1 (SS-SINR for FR1), respectively.

#### 9.2B.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

For 2Rx RedCap: The requirements in clause 9.2.4.2 shall apply.

For 1Rx RedCap: Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.1A.2.1 (SS-RSRP for FR1), 10.1A.6.1 (SS-RSRQ
for FR1) and 10.1A.10.1 (SS-SINR for FR1), respectively.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2B.4.3.

#### 9.2B.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

For 2Rx RedCap: The requirements in clause 9.2.4.3 shall apply.

For 1Rx RedCap: Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.1A.2.1 (SS-RSRP for FR1), 10.1A.6.1 (SS-RSRQ
for FR1) and 10.1A.10.1 (SS-SINR for FR1), respectively.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_RedCap~ or
T ~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_RedCap~ defined in clause 9.2B.5.1
or clause 9.2B.6.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~ as defined in clause 9.2B.5.1 or
clause 9.2B.6.1. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the
time period T~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_RedCap~ or
T~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_RedCap~ defined in clause 9.2B.5.1 or
clause 9.2B.6.1 becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then
the cell becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception
parameter and triggers an event, the event triggered measurement
reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~ provided the timing to that
cell has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement
gap has not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ*
is the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\].
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.2B.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2B.5.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if the UE is not
indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated
SSB index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap.~ It is assumed that
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_RedCap~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in tables 9.2B.5.1-1, 9.2B.5.1-2, 9.2B.5.1-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_RedCap~: it is the time period used to
acquire the index of the SSB being measured given in tables 9.2B.5.1-4,
9.2B.5.1-5

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~: equal to a measurement
period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2B.5.2-1, table
9.2B.5.2-2, table 9.2B.5.2-3.

CSSF~intra\_RedCap~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in clause 9.1A.5.1
for measurement conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when
intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping or partially overlapping
with measurement gaps, or according to CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in
clause 9.1A.5.2 for measurement conducted within measurement gaps, i.e.
when intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise
the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions corresponds to
the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

For 2Rx RedCap:

M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ : For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 1 or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ =40. For a UE
supporting power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~
=24.

M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ : For a UE supporting power class 1
or 5, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ =40. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3, 4, or 7, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ =24.

When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, K~p~=1.

When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. For
calculation of K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\]) of
*smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List* parameter
in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC periodicity
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1.*

If the higher layer signaling in TS38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2
is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~

For FR2,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and *SS-RSSI-Measurement* are
configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by the union set
of SSB-ToMeasure from all the configured measurement objects on the same
serving carrier which can be merged. and RSSI symbols are indicated by
*SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

#### 9.2B.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2B.5.2-1, 9.2B.5.2-2, 9.2B.5.2-3.

If the higher layer signaling in TS38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2
is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~.

For FR2, a longer measurement period is allowed, if aperiodic CSI-RS
resource is measured for L1-RSRP measurement on any FR2 serving
frequency in the same band, and the CSI-RS resource is outside
measurement gap and overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols. If *SSB-ToMeasure* or *SS-RSSI-Measurement* is configured, the
SSB symbols are indicated by the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects on the same band which can be merged
and the RSSI symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*.

#### 9.2B.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

UE shall be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the SSB
is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When any
of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of SSB-ToMeasure from all the configured measurement objects on the
same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

##### 9.2B.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

### 9.2B.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2B.6.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if UE is not indicated
to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap.~ The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap.~ It is assumed that
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ =
T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~ =
T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~ + T

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_RedCap~ ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2B.6.1-1 or 9.2B.6.1-2 or 9.2B.6.1-3.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~: equal to a measurement
period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2B.6.2-1 or 9.2B.6.2-2
or 9.2B.6.2-3.

determined according to CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in clause 9.1A.5.2
for measurement conducted within measurement gaps.

For 2Rx RedCap:

M~pss/sss\_sync\_with\_gaps\_RedCap~ : For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 1 or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps\_RedCap~ =40. For a UE

9.2C NR intra-frequency measurements for SAN
--------------------------------------------

### 9.2C.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.2C apply for intra-frequency measurements
on an SAN carrier frequency. The requirements apply provided that valid
parameters of ephemeris information, epoch time of the ephemeris, common
TA, validity timer information, downlink polarization information for
target NR SAN cell are send to UE.

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement, or

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP\[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2C.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or more measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements,

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is not configured, up to two measurement
window periodicities may be configured with *SSB-MTC* and *SSB-MTC2*

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is configured, multiple measurement window
offsets may be configured with *SSB-MTC* and *SSB-MTC4List-r17*, and the
requriements in 9.2C apply provided that the total number of measurement
window offsets does not exceed the UE capability *parallelSMTC-r17*

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching
time is 0.5ms for frequency range FR1.

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2C.5 applies
for the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

> \- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the union of concurrent measurement gaps.
>
> \- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

> \- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap.
>
> \- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2C.6 applies
for the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with measurement gap,

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

> \- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap in the
> concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
> SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are
> overlapped with the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

> \- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap.

### 9.2C.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2C apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

\- Valid information for the satellite serving the target cell has been
provided

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2C for FR1, for
a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7C for FR1, for
a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12C for FR1,
for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.17 for a corresponding
Band.

### 9.2C.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2C.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 8 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell (except for the
SCell) is not smaller than the number of configured RLM-RS SSB
resources.

\- 4 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI from neighbour cells in
GEO deployment.

\- In NGSO deployments: cells from 2 satellites including the satellite
serving the PCell if UE does not support the capability
*maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*; or cells from 3 or 4
satellites satellites including the satellite serving the PCell,
depending on the value indicated in
*maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*.

### 9.2C.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2C.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodic
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.2C.1
(RSRP for FR1), 10.1.7C.1 (RSRQ for FR1) and 10.1.12C.1 (RS-SINR for
FR1).

#### 9.2C.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2C.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.7C.1 (RSRQ for FR1) and
10.1.12C.1 (RS-SINR for FR1)..

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2C.4.3.

#### 9.2C.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2C.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.7C.1 (RSRQ for FR1) and 10.1.12C.1
(RS-SINR for FR1)..

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ intra\ with\ index~ or T
~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ defined in clause 9.2C.5.1 or clause
9.2C.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2C.5.1 or clause 9.2C.6.2. When L3 filtering is
used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.2C.5 Intra frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2C.5.1 Intra frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if the UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~. The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2C.5.1-1

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2C.5.1-2

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.2C.5.2-1

K~multi\_SMTC~ is the scaling factor for measurement of multiple SMTCs
or multiple satellites, and

if SMTCs do not overlap with each other,

\- $K_{multi\_ SMTC} = 1$, if GEO satellites are measured on the
carrier;

\-
$K_{multi\_ SMTC} = \left\lceil \frac{N_{LEO,i}}{N_{LEO,simul}} \right\rceil$,
if LEO satellites are measured on the carrier;

if SMTCs partially overlap with each other,

\- $K_{multi\_ SMTC} = N_{SMTC,overlap}$, if only GEO satellites are
measured on the carrier;

\-
$K_{multi\_ SMTC} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{SMTC,overlap}}\left\lceil \frac{N_{LEO,i}}{N_{LEO,simul}} \right\rceil$,
if only LEO satellites are measured on the carrier;

where

\- $N_{LEO,i}$ is the number of LEO satellites to be measured within
i-th SMTC,

\- $N_{LEO,simul}$ is the number of LEO satellites that UE can measure
in parallel within an SMTC,

\- $N_{SMTC,overlap}$ is the number of SMTCs that partially overlap with
each other.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1.

> if the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
> configured, the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions
> corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise
> the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions corresponds
> to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

K~p~ is the scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = N~total\_SAN~ / N~available\_SAN~,
where N~available\_SAN~ and N~total\_SAN~ are calculated as follows:

> \- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
>
> \- If UE supports *parallelMeasurementGap-r17* and is configured with
> concurrent measurement gaps, MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all
> configured per-UE measurement gap. Otherwise, MGRP max is the MGRP of
> configured measurement gap.
>
> \- Starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:
>
> \- N~total\_SAN~ is the total number of SMTC occasions within the
> window, including those overlapped and non-overlapped with measurement
> gap occasions within the window, and
>
> \- N~available\_SAN~ is the number of SMTC occasions within the window
> W that don't collide with any non-dropped MG occasion within or
> outside the window W, after accounting for measurement gap collisions
> by applying the measurement gap collision rule in section 9.1C.8.3.
> The collision rule between SMTC occasion and measurement gap occasion
> is defined in section 9.1C.9.1
>
> K~p~ = \[1\] when N~available\_SAN~ = 0 and measurement gap sharing in
> clause 9.1.2.1a shall apply.
>
> K~p~ = 1 when intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with

K~layer1\_measurement~: it is scaling factor for sharing between L3 and
L1 measurement, and K~layer1\_measurement~ =1, if GEO satellites are
measured on the carrier, or if LEO satellites are measured on the
carrier and UE supports *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17*,
otherwise

K~layer1\_measurement~ =1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap are not fully
overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped
by intra-frequency SMTC occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and
*SS-RSSI-Measurement* are configured, and RSSI symbols are indicated by
*SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~ =1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

If the higher layer signaling in TS38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and smtc2
is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or

#### 9.2C.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of SSB-ToMeasure from all the configured measurement objects on the
same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included. For UL, the scheduling
restriction applies to UL symbols that fully or partially overlap with
the restricted symbols as defined below.

##### 9.2C.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

The UE shall be able to receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to
be measured., if the following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

##### 9.2C.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on a neighbor cell served by a different satellite in LEO

For UE which do not support *the capability
parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17* the following restrictions
apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement on a neighbor cell served by
a different satellite in LEO.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

\- If the following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

\- The UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to
be measured.

### 9.2C.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2C.6.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2C.6.2-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2C.6.2-2.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.2C.6.3-1.

K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps.** When the UE is
**configured with concurrent measurement gaps and the two measurement
gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP=160ms, K~gap~ = 2. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap, and
starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other measurement gap occasions
within the window**, and**

**- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap **within the
window W after accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the
measurement gap collision rule in section 9.1.8.3.**

9.3 NR inter-frequency measurements
-----------------------------------

### 9.3.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or PSCell,
even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities
is provided.

A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps (either legacy measurement gap or NCSG) in
active BWP, for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap* provided that

\- the UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\], and

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.

\- For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps,
UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.9.3.

\- Note: Non-CA capable UE is not expected to indicate support of
interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16 \[15\].

Besides the conditions listed above,

for UE supporting nr-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17 and indicating
NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR for inter-frequency measurement,

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement without
gap if

\- the UE indicates 'nogap-noncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

\- During inter-frequency SSB based measurements without MG and NCSG, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.9.4.

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with
NCSG if

\- the UE indicates 'ncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

\- During inter-frequency SSB based measurements with NCSG, UE may cause
scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.10.3.

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap
if

\- the UE indicates 'gap' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ on an inter-frequency measurement object which
start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor detect
SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which ends later than the gap end --
switching time. When the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-FR
gap is configured to the UE in EN-DC, SA NR, NE-DC and NR-DC, or the
serving cells are in FR2, the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the
per-UE gap is configured to the UE in SA NR and NR-DC, the switching
time is 0.25ms. Otherwise the switching time is 0.5ms.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

Longer measurement period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an NR CGI.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3.4 and clause
9.3.5 applies for the following scenarios:

> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap.
>
> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement
> gap for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap*, when
>
> \- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap or associated
> measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
> SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object are
> overlapped with the union of concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap or associated measurement
> gap in concurrent measurement gaps and the flag
> *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is not configured by the Network.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3.9 applies for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps, if UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the
flag *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps, if UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the
flag *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3.10 applies
for the following scenarios:

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap,
when all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the NCSG;

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with NCSG.

### 9.3.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3 apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4 and 10.1.5
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9 and 10.1.10
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14 and 10.1.15
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
Band.

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

K~gap~ is a scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

\- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement
gap(s) and per-FR measurement gap(s) within the same FR, and starting
from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including those dropped and non-dropped instances of the associated
measurement gap within the window**, and**

\- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap within the
window W, after accounting for collisions between the measurement gaps
by applying the measurement gap collision rule in section 9.1.8.3.

K~gap~ **is only applicable for UE supporting**
*concurrentMeasGap-r17***.** When concurrent measurement gaps are
configured, requirements in this clause do not apply if N~available~ =0.

### 9.3.5 Inter-frequency measurements

When measurement gaps are provided for inter frequency measurements, or
the UE supports capability of conducting such measurements without gaps,
the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and
SS-SINR measurements to higher layers with measurement accuracy as
specified in clauses *10.1.4, 10.1.5, 10.1.9, 10.1.10, 10.1.14 and
10.1.15*, respectively, as shown in table 9.3.5-1 and 9.3.5-2. When
*highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured, and UE supports
*measurementEnhancementInterFreq-r17*, T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ is specified in Table 9.3.5-3. When
SCG is deactivated, T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ is specified in
Table 9.3.5-4 applies for inter-frequency carrier configured by SCG and
not configured by MCG and table 9.3.5-2 applies for inter-frequency
carrier configured by both SCG and MCG. Regardless of whether the SCG is
activated or deactivated, table 9.3.5-2 applies for an inter-frequency
carrier configured only by MCG.

clauses 10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1, 10.1.9.1, 10.1.10.1, 10.1.14.1 and
10.1.15.1, respectively.*

*The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3.6.3.*

#### 9.3.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1, 10.1.9.1, 10.1.10.1, 10.1.14.1 and 10.1.15.1,
respectively.*

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.*

*The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be* within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is
not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the
associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~.
*Both* T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ *and*
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ *are defined in clause 9.3.4. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.* In EN-DC and
NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform E-UTRA SRS
carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected in FR1 if
the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not
capable of per-FR gap.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.3.4 or clause 9.3.9.1 or clause 9.3.10.1. If a cell
which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~
defined in clause 9.3.4 or clause 9.3.9.1 or clause 9.3.10.1 becomes
undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes
detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and triggers
an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less
than T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap
has not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is
the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected. In EN-DC and
NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform E-UTRA SRS
carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected in FR1 if
the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be expected
in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

### 9.3.8 Inter-frequency SFTD measurement requirements

#### 9.3.8.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for a UE supporting NR inter-frequency
SFTD measurement and is applicable in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The UE
shall, depending on network request, perform inter-frequency SFTD
measurement and report SFTD result with or without SS-RSRP. The overall
delay includes RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\] and SFTD measurement reporting delay in clause 9.3.8.3.

UE which fulfils the requirements in clause 9.3.8 is not supposed to
fulfil the requirements defined in clause 9.2.5.4.

#### 9.3.8.2 SFTD Measurement delay

The requirements on SFTD measurement delay defined in this clause are
applicable under the side condition SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -3 dB for the
inter-frequency neighbour cell. Depending on configuration, the SFTD
measurement may be carried out with or without the support of configured
measurement gaps. In the current release, indication on whether to carry
out the SFTD measurement with or without measurement gaps is implicit
and depending on whether measurement gaps are configured.

The UE shall be able to detect, identify and measure SFTD of up to 3 of
the strongest applicable inter-frequency neighbour cells on the carrier
frequency provided in the SFTD measurement configuration. Further
depending on the SFTD measurement configuration, the UE shall
additionally report SS-RSRP for the one or more strongest cells. The UE
may or may not be configured with *cellsForWhichToReportSFTD*. The UE
does not expect *cellsForWhichToReportSFTD* to change during an ongoing
SFTD measurement.

When no measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of
finding the inter-frequency neighbour cell regardless of its SSB
position in the SMTC period, provided that the carrier frequency where
SFTD measurement is configured and the serving carrier(s) form a
supported CA or NR-DC band combination of the UE. The SFTD measurement
shall be conducted with sustained connection to the PCell and activated
SCell(s) in MCG. Depending on capability, the UE may be allowed to cause
a certain amount of interruptions for reconfiguration of the radio
receiver, as specified in clause 8.2.2.2.6.

When measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of finding
the inter-frequency neighbour cell under the additional condition that
the SSB at least occasionally falls within the measurement gap.

When no DRX is used, the UE shall be capable of determining SFTD within
a physical layer measurement period of T~measure\_SFTD1~ as follows:

> \- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and without
> additional SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 14 SMTC periods

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 112 SMTC periods

\- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and without additional
SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 8 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period)

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 64 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period))

\- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and with additional
SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 19 SMTC periods

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 152 SMTC periods

\- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and with additional
SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 13 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period)

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 104 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period)

where CSSF~inter~ is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

When DRX is used, the same T~measure\_SFTD1~ as for non-DRX applies, but
the reporting delay depends on the DRX cycle length in use.

In case PCell is changed due to handover, the UE shall terminate the
inter-frequency SFTD measurement.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement shall fulfil the
requirement in clause 10.1.21.3. The measurement accuracy for
additionally reported SS-RSRP shall fulfil the requirement in clauses
10.1.4.1 and 10.1.5.1 for neighbour cell in FR1 and FR2, respectively.

#### 9.3.8.3 SFTD Measurement reporting delay

The SFTD measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between a
command that will trigger an SFTD measurement report and the point when
the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface.
This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty of 2 × TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting
the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE
to send the measurement report.

The SFTD measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~measure\_SFTD1~ defined in clause 9.3.8.2 plus the RRC procedure delay
defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.3.9 Inter frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.3.9.1 Inter frequency Cell identification

UE satisfying the applicability conditions specified in 9.3.1 on the
requirement in this clause shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is
not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the
associated SSB index (*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or
*maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not configured) or
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is configured for the FR1 and FR2-1
target frequency layers and and UE supporting
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*. Otherwise UE shall be able
to identify a new detectable inter frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter frequency SS block of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~.

\- For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps
in active BWP, it is assumed that when UE performs inter-frequency
measurements without measurement gaps in a TDD bands on FR1 and FR2, SFN
and frame boundary across serving cell and inter-frequency neighbor
cells is aligned

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3.9.1-1 and table 9.3.9.1-2.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3.9.1-3 and table
9.3.9.1-4.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.3.9.2-1, table 9.3.9.2-2, and
table 9.3.9.2-3 and table 9.3.9.2-3a when *highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17*
is configured and UE supports measurementEnhancementInterFreq-r17.

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside GAP, i.e. when interfrequency SMTC is fully non
overlapping or partially overlapping with GAPs.

M~meas\_period\_inter~ =64. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 2,
M~meas\_period\_inter~=40. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 3,
M~meas\_period\_inter~ =40. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 4,

M~meas\_period\_inter~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 3,
M~meas\_period\_inter~ = 60. For FR1, M~meas\_period\_inter~ = 8.When UE
supports *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and is configured with concurrent
measurement gaps,

K~p~ is a scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where
N~available~ and N~total~ are calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and per-FR MG within
the same FR as the SSB frequency layer, and starting at the beginning of
any SMTC occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions within the window,
including those overlapped with MG occasions within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are not overlapped
with any non-dropped MG occasion within the window W, after accounting
for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision rule provided
that concurrent measurement gaps are configured.

K~p~ = 1 when N~available~ = 0.

Otherwise, when UE is not configured with or UE does not support
concurrent measurement gaps:

> When interfrequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement
> gaps or NCSG, or interfrequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs or
> NCSG, K~p~ =1.

When interfrequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement gaps,
K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. When
inter-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with NCSG, K~p~ = 1/(1-
(SMTC period /VIRP)), where SMTC period \< VIRP.

For FR2,

\- K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band outside
measurement gap are not fully overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and *SS-RSSI-Measurement* are
configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

For calculation of K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\])
of *smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List*
parameter in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC
periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1.*

#### 9.3.9.3 Scheduling availability of UE during inter-frequency measurements when the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE is
required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the
SSB is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When
any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the

#### 9.3.10.3 Scheduling availability during inter-frequency measurement with NCSG

When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on
the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

The requirements in clause 9.3.10.3.3 based on
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell-inter* apply provided that UE supports
ncsg-*SymbolLevelScheduleRestrictionInter-r17*. If UE does not support
*ncsg-SymbolLevelScheduleRestrictionInter-r17*, the requirements in
clause 9.3.10.3.3 apply assuming *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell-inter* is not
enabled.

##### 9.3.10.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When the UE performs inter-frequency measurements with NCSG in a TDD
band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR
measurement when (1) *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* is not supported for
the target measurement band and the serving cell's band, or (2) target
measurement and the serving cell are on the same band or on the band
with overlapping DL frequency with UE's serving cell(s).

> The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on the union of
> restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of all MOs, where
> the restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of MO *i*
> include

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to
be measured on MO *i*, and ***△t*** serving cell symbol before each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and ***△t*** serving cell symbol
after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC window
duration, if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled for MO *i*.
***△t is defined as the minimum integer number of symbols with total
duration no smaller than the tolerance specified in clause 7.9.***

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SMTC window for
MO *i* and on 1 serving cell symbol before and after the SMTC window, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled for MO *i*,

When the UE performs inter-frequency measurements with NCSG in a TDD
band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement when
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* is not supported for the target
measurement band and the serving cell band

> The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on the union of
> restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of all MOs, where
> the restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of MO *i*
> include

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to
be measured on MO *i*, and ***△t*** serving cell symbol before each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and RSSI measurement symbols, and
***△t*** serving cell symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured and RSSI measurement symbols within SMTC window duration, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled for MO *i*. ***△t is
defined as the minimum integer number of symbols with total duration no
smaller than the tolerance specified in clause 7.9.***

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SMTC window for
MO *i* and on 1 serving cell symbol before and after the SMTC window, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled for MO *i*.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1.*

##### 9.3.10.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement when the target inter-frequency layer to be measured is on
the same band with UE's serving cell(s) or on the band with overlapping
DL frequency with UE's serving cell(s).

\- The UE is not expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
the union of restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of all
MOs, where the restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of MO
*i* include

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to
be measured on MO *i*, and ***△t*** serving cell symbol before each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and ***△t*** serving cell symbol
after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC window
duration, if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled for MO *i*.
***△t is defined as the minimum integer number of symbols with total
duration no smaller than the tolerance specified in clause 7.9.***

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SMTC window for
MO *i* and on 1 serving cell symbol before and after the SMTC window, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled for MO *i,*

If the high layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331
\[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1.*

##### 9.3.10.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR2

When (1) UE does not support IBM between target measurement band and
serving cell's band(s) nor *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA*, or (2) target
measurement and a serving cell are on the same band, the following
scheduling restriction applies to the serving cell due to SS-RSRP or
SS-SINR measurement on an FR2 inter-frequency cell with NCSG:

The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on the union of restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of all MOs, where the restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of MO *i* include

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to
be measured on MO *i*, and ***△t*** serving cell symbol before each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and ***△t*** serving cell symbol
after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC window
duration, if *deriveSSB‑IndexFromCellInter‑r17* is enabled for MO *i*.
***△t is defined as the minimum integer number of symbols with total
duration no smaller than the tolerance specified in clause 7.8.***

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SMTC window for
MO *i* and on 1 serving cell symbol before and after the SMTC window, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled for MO *i*,

and due to SS-RSRQ measurement on an FR2 inter-frequency cell with NCSG

The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on the union of restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of all MOs, where the restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of MO *i* include

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to
be measured on MO *i*, and ***△t*** serving cell symbol before each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and RSSI measurement symbols, and
***△t*** serving cell symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured and RSSI measurement symbols within SMTC window duration, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled for MO *i*. ***△t is
defined as the minimum integer number of symbols with total duration no
smaller than the tolerance specified in clause 7.8.***

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SMTC window for
MO *i* and on 1 serving cell symbol before and after the SMTC window, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled for MO *i*.

When UE does not support IBM between target measurement band and serving
cell's band(s) but supports *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA*, the following
scheduling restriction applies to the serving cell due to SS-RSRP or
SS-SINR measurement on an FR2 inter-frequency cell with NCSG

The UE is not expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on the
union of restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of all MOs,
where the restricted serving cell symbols due to measurement of MO *i*
include

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to

9.3A NR inter-frequency measurements in carrier frequencies with CCA
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.3A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.3A apply for inter-frequency measurements
on a carrier frequency with CCA. A measurement is defined as an SSB
based inter-frequency measurement provided it is not defined as an
intra-frequency measurement according to clause 9.2A.The UE shall be
able to identify new inter-frequency cells in carrier frequencies with
CCA and perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified
inter-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell or PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer
cell identities is provided.

When the inter-frequency measurement is performed on a neighbour cell in
FR2-2 with shared spectrum channel access, UE shall determine the CCA
mode of the neighbour cell according to *channelAccessMode2-r17*of the
cell configured in *MeasObjectNR*. If *channelAccessMode2-r17* of the
cell is enabled, UE shall assume that CCA applies to the cell and
perform measurement accordingly, and the requirements in clause 9.3A
shall apply; otherwise, UE shall assume that CCA does not apply to the
cell and perform measurement accordingly, and requirements in 9.3 shall
apply.

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than the
gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which end later than
the gap end -- switching time.

In the requirements of clause 9.3A, the term SMTC occasion not available
at the UE refers to when the SMTC contains SSBs configured by gNB in a
cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but N candidate SSB
positions for the same SS/PBCH block index within the discovery burst
transmission window are not available at the UE due to DL CCA failures
at gNB during the corresponding evaluation or measurement period, where:

\- For the cell detection procedure: N is at least one candidate SSB
position (NOTE: the one candidate SSB position for the cell detection
shall not be impacted by the set of candidate SSB positions which are
already being measured by the UE within the current measurement period
of the on-going measurements), and

\- For other procedures in clause 9.3A: N are the first two successive
candidate SSB positions when two or more candidate SSB positions are
configured for this SSB index in one discovery burst transmission
window, otherwise N is one candidate SSB position;

otherwise the SMTC occasion is considered as available at the UE.

For the FR2-2 requirements of clause 9.3A, an SMTC occasion group
consists of N consecutive SMTC occasions. An SMTC occasion group is not
available, when at least one SMTC occasion in the group is not
transmitted by the gNB.

### 9.3A.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3A apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency CCA cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.28,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clause 10.1.30 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clause 10.1.32 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.9.

### 9.3A.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.3A.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB indexes and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

#### 9.3A.3.2 Requirements for FR2-2

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 10 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer, and

\- 1 SSB per identified cell.

### 9.3A.4 Inter-frequency cell identification

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report
SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell, in carrier frequencies with CCA, within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to identify a
new detectable inter-frequency SS block, in carrier frequencies with
CCA, of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~
+ T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1 and table 9.3A.4-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3A.4-2 and Table
9.3A.4-4.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement period
of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.

CSSF~inter~ : it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\ CCA~ = 96. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\ CCA~ = 60.

M~SSB\_index\_inter\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2 or 3,
M~SSB\_index\_inter\ CCA~ = 48 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 1, M~SSB\_index\_inter\ CCA~ = 72 samples

M~meas\_period\_inter\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~meas\_period\_inter\ CCA~ = 96. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
2, M~meas\_period\_inter\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 3, M~meas\_period\_inter\ CCA~ = 60

The UE shall restart the measurement upon exceeding L~meas,gap,max~. The
requirements apply provided that any two closest SMTC occasions
available at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more
than the maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known.

### 9.3A.6 NR Inter-frequency measurements reporting requirements

#### 9.3A.6.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.28, 10.1.30, and 10.1.32, respectively.

#### 9.3A.6.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.28, 10.1.30, and 10.1.32, respectively.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3A.6.3.

#### 9.3A.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.28, 10.1.30, and 10.1.32, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report, and all delays due to
UL CCA failures until the successful transmission of the report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be within T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ if UE
is not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the
associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~. Both
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_without\_index~ and
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~ are defined in clause 9.3A.4.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSB measured from the cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.3A.4. If a
cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.3A.4 becomes
undetectable for a period ≤ 8 seconds and then the cell becomes
detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and then
triggers the measurement report as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ defined in clause 9.3A.5
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ±
3200/$2^{µ}$ Tc while measurement gap has not been available and the L3
filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as
defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3 filtering is used an
additional delay can be expected.

### 9.3A.8 Inter-frequency RSSI measurements

An RSSI measurement is defined as an inter-frequency measurement
provided that the RSSI measurement bandwidth is not contained within the
current carrier bandwidth of the UE.

The UE physical layer shall be capable of performing the RSSI
measurements, defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] on one or more inter-frequency
carriers operating with CCA, TS 37.213 \[33\], if the carrier(s) are
indicated by higher layers \[2\], and report the RSSI measurements to
higher layers. The UE physical layer shall provide to higher layers a
single RSSI sample for each OFDM symbol within each configured RSSI
measurement duration \[2\] occurring with a configured RSSI measurement
timing configuration periodicity \[2\], *rmtc-Periodicity*. The
requirements apply if *rmtc-SubframeOffset* \[2\] is configured.

For performing inter-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2,

\- If a UE has serving cell in FR2-2,

\- If the TCI state is provided in RMTC configuration of FR2-2, the UE
shall assume the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with
TypeD to the DL RS associated with the TCI state provided in the RMTC
configuration. The UE does not expect to be configured with an explicit
TCI-state in RMTC-Config with a reference serving cell in FR1 or FR2-1.
If no TCI state is provided in the RMTC configuration, the UE shall
assume the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD
to one of the latest received PDSCH and the latest monitored CORESET in
the active BWP of a serving carrier in FR2-2.

\- If a UE has no serving cell in FR2-2,

\- The UE does not expect that a TCI state is provided in RMTC
configuration. It is up to UE implementation how to determine the
spatial domain filter for the inter-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2,
and no requirements are defined.

For RSSI measurement in FR2-2 with SCS of 480 kHz or 960 kHz, the RSSI
measurement results shall be derived based on symbols configured by RMTC
except for the first symbol and the last symbol in RMTC, and there is no
requirements when *measDurationSymbols* is configured as 1.

measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent inter-frequency measurements, including inter-frequency RSSI
measurements. The RSSI measurement duration and the measurement gap
shall be aligned, and the following additional condition shall be

concurrent inter-frequency measurements, including inter-frequency
channel occupancy measurements. The RSSI measurement duration used for
channel occupancy measurement and the measurement gap shall be aligned,
and the following additional condition shall be fulfilled:

the measurement reporting range specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

9.3B NR inter-frequency measurements for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------

### 9.3B.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2B.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap*
provided

\- the UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\], and

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.

For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3B.7.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than the
gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which ends later than
the gap end -- switching time. When the serving cells are in FR2, the
inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-UE gap or per-FR gap is
configured to the UE in SA NR, the switching time is 0.25ms. Otherwise
the switching time is 0.5ms.

Longer measurement period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI\_RedCap~ when the UE is requested to decode an NR/E-UTRA
CGI.

### 9.3B.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3B apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4 and 10.1.5
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9 and 10.1.10
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14 and 10.1.15
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
Band.

\- For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.4 for FR1 for
a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.4 for FR1 for
a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.4 for FR1,
respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.16 for a corresponding
Band.

### 9.3B.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.3B.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

#### 9.3B.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 10 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer, and

\- 1 SSB per identified cell.

### 9.3B.4 Inter-frequency measurement with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~. The
UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency SS block
of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3B.4-1, table 9.3B.4-2, table 9.3B.4-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used to
acquire the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3B.4-4,
table 9.3B.4-5, table 9.3B.4-6.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: equal to a measurement
period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3B.5-1, table 9.3B.5-2,
table 9.3B.5-3.

For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1
or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 64 samples. For a UE supporting
FR2 power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40
samples.

M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3,4 or 7, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 24 samples.

M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =64 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =40 samples.

CSSF~inter\_RedCap~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in clause 9.1A.5.2
for measurement conducted within measurement gaps.

### 9.3B.6 Inter-frequency measurements reporting requirements

#### 9.3B.6.1 Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The requirements in clause 9.3.6.1 shall apply.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses* 10.1A.4.1, 10.1A.8.1 and 10.1A.12.1*,
respectively.*

#### 9.3B.6.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1, 10.1.9.1, 10.1.10.1,
10.1.14.1 and 10.1.15.1, respectively.*

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses* 10.1A.4.1, 10.1A.8.1 and 10.1A.12.1*,
respectively.*

*The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3B.6.3.*

#### 9.3B.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1, 10.1.9.1, 10.1.10.1,
10.1.14.1 and 10.1.15.1, respectively.*

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses* 10.1A.4.1, 10.1A.8.1 and 10.1A.12.1*,
respectively.*

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.*

*The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be* within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_\ RedCap~
if UE is not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with
the associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_\ RedCap~. *Both*
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_\ RedCap~ *and*
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_\ RedCap~ *are defined in clause 9.3B.4.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.*

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_\ RedCap~ or
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_\ RedCap~ as defined in clause 9.3B.4 or
9.3B.7.1. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify\ inter\ without\ index\_\ RedCap~ or
T~identify\ inter\ with\ index\_\ RedCap~ defined in clause 9.3B.4 or
9.3B.7.1 becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell
becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and
triggers an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_\ RedCap~ provided the
timing to that cell has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while
the measurement gap has not been available and L3 filtering has not been
used, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS
38.211 \[3\]. When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be
expected.

### 9.3B.7 Inter frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.3B.7.1 Inter frequency Cell identification

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~. The
UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency SS block
of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~. It is assumed that when UE
performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps in a TDD
bands on FR1 and FR2, the following conditions are met:

\- SFN and frame boundary across serving cell and inter-frequency
neighbor cells is aligned, and

\- the timing of SSBs across serving cell and inter-frequency neighbor
cells are aligned

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3B.7.1-1, table 9.3B.7.1-2 and table
9.3B.7.1-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used to
acquire the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3B.7.1-4
and table 9.3B.7.1-5.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: equal to a measurement
period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3B.7.2-1, table
9.3B.7.2-2 and table 9.3B.7.2-3.

CSSF~inter\_RedCap~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in clause 9.1A.5.1
for measurement conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when
interfrequency SMTC is fully non overlapping or partially overlapping
with measurement gaps or according to CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in
clause 9.1A.5.2 for measurement conducted within measurement gaps, i.e.
when interfrequency SMTC is fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1
or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting
FR2 power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 24
samples.

M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 24 samples.

M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =24 samples.

When inter-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or inter-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, K~p~=1.

When inter-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP.

For FR2,

K~layer1\_measurement~ =1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and *SS-RSSI-Measurement* are
configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by SSB-ToMeasure \[2\],
if it is configured; otherwise, all L SSB symbols within the SMTC window
duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

The scheduling availability requirements when UE performs
inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps in a TDD bands on
FR1 and FR2 and HD-FDD UE performs inter-frequency measurements without

SS-SINR measurement

\- UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be
measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured within SMTC window duration.

When UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a TDD band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ

*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology-Inter-r16* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a TDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1
data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within
SMTC window duration.

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a FDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within SMTC window
duration.

##### 9.3B.7.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR
measurement on an FR2 inter-frequency cell

The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1
data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within
SMTC window duration.

The following scheduling restriction applies to SS-RSRQ measurement on
an FR2 inter-frequency cell

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, RSSI
measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration*.*

If following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, the
UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, the
UE shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that the UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured.

##### 9.3B.7.3.4 Scheduling availability of HD-FDD UE performing measurements on FR1

When HD-FDD UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement
gaps in a FR1 band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or
SS-SINR measurement

\- UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be
measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured within SMTC window duration.

gaps in a FR1 band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ
measurement

\- UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be
measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration.

9.3C NR inter-frequency measurements for SAN
--------------------------------------------

### 9.3C.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2. The requirements apply provided the valid parameters of
ephemeris information, epoch time of the ephemeris, common TA, validity
timer information, downlink polarization information for target NR SAN
cell are send to UE.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap*
provided

\- the UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\], and

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- the flag *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the
Network.

For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3C.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or more measurement
timing configurations (SMTC) which provides periodicity, duration and
offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements on
the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, the measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is not configured, one measurement window
periodicity will be configured with *SSB-MTC*

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is configured, multiple measurement window
offsets may be configured with *SSB-MTC* and *SSB-MTC4List-r17*, and the
requirements in 9.3C apply provided that the total number of measurement
window offsets does not exceed the UE capability *parallelSMTC-r17*

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than the
gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which ends later than
the gap end -- switching time, and the switching time is 0.5ms.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3C.4 and clause
9.3C.5 applies for the following scenarios:

> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap.
>
> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement
> gap when
>
> \- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap or associated
> measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
> SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object are
> overlapped with the union of concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap or associated measurement
> gap in concurrent measurement gaps.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3C.7 applies
for the following scenarios:

> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
> none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
> are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
> measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps.

### 9.3C.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3C apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4C for FR1, for
a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9C for FR1, for
a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14C for FR1,
for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.18 for a corresponding
Band.

### 9.3C.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.3C.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

\- 4 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI from neighbour cells in
GEO deployment.

\- In NGSO deployments: cells from 2 satellites if UE does not support
the capability *maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*; or cells from
3 or 4 satellites depending on the value indicated in
*maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*.

### 9.3C.4 Inter-frequency measurement with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3C.4-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3C.4-2.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.3C.5-1.

> CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
> according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
> conducted within measurement gaps.

K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps.** When the UE is
**configured with concurrent measurement gaps and the two measurement
gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP=160ms, K~gap~ = 2. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap, and
starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other measurement gap occasions
within the window**, and**

**- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap **within the
window W after accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the
measurement gap collision rule in section 9.1.8C.3.**

K~gap~ **is only applicable for UE supporting**
*parallelMeasurementGap-r17***.** When concurrent measurement gaps are
configured, requirements in this clause do not apply if N~available~ =0,
or if one SMTC overlaps more than one MGs associated to the frequency
layer.

K\_satellite: it is a satellite specific scaling factor.

If SMTCs within a measurement gap do not overlap with each other, and if
LEO and/or GEO satellite(s) is/are required to be measured within SMTC

K\_satellite = 1, if GSO satellites are measured on the carrier

$K\_ satellite = \left\lceil \frac{\text{Num}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{to}\ \text{be}\ \text{measured}\ \text{in}\ \text{the}\ \text{SMTC}}{\text{number}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{UE}\ \text{is}\ \text{capable}\ \text{to}\ \text{measure}\ \text{in}\ \text{one}\ \text{SMTC}} \right\rceil$,
if LEO satellites are measured on the carrier.

If SMTCs within a measurement gap partially overlap with each other, and
if LEO and/or GEO satellite(s) is/are required to be measured within
overlapped SMTCs

$K\_ satellite = \text{number}\ \text{of}\ \text{overlapped}\ \text{SMTCs}$,
if only GEO satellites are measured on the carrier

$K\_ satellite = \sum_{i}^{}\left\lceil \frac{\text{Num}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{to}\ \text{be}\ \text{measured}\ \text{in}\ \text{the}\ \text{SMTC}\ i}{\text{number}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{UE}\ \text{is}\ \text{capable}\ \text{to}\ \text{measure}\ \text{in}\ \text{one}\ \text{SMTC}} \right\rceil$,
if only LEO satellites are measured on the carrier.

### 9.3C.6 Inter-frequency measurements reporting requirements

#### 9.3C.6.1 Periodic Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses* 10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C*, respectively.*

#### 9.3C.6.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses* 10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C*, respectively.*

*The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3C.6.3.*

#### 9.3C.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses*
10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C*, respectively.*

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.*

*The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be* within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is
not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the
associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~.
*Both* T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ *and*
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ *are defined in clause 9.3C.4. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.* I

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSB measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2C.5.1 or clause 9.2C.6.2. If a cell which has been
detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ or T~identify\ intra\ with\ index~
defined in clause 9.2C.5.1 or clause 9.2C.6.2 becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again with the
same spatial reception parameter and triggers an event, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap has
not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the
SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3
filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.3C.7 Inter frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.3C.7.1 Inter frequency Cell identification

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~.

>
> T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ + T

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3C.7.1-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3C.7.1-2.

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.3C.7.2-1.

> CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

K~p~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = N~total\_SAN~ / N~available\_SAN~,
where N~available\_SAN~ and N~total\_SAN~ are calculated as follows:

SS-SINR measurements to higher layers with measurement accuracy as
specified in clauses 10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C, respectively, as
shown in table 9.3C.7.2-1, if UE supports inter-frequency measurement

#### 9.3C.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE during inter-frequency measurements

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE is
required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the
SSB is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When
any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by SSB-ToMeasure \[2\],
if it is configured; otherwise, all L SSB symbols within the SMTC window
duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included. For UL,
the scheduling restriction applies to UL symbols that fully or partially
overlap with the restricted symbols as defined below.

##### 9.3C.7.3.1 Void

##### 9.3C.7.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology-Inter-r16* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a FDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within SMTC window
duration.

9.4 Inter-RAT measurements
--------------------------

### 9.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are specified for NR−E-UTRAN FDD and
NR−E-UTRAN TDD measurements and are applicable without an explicit
E-UTRAN neighbour cell list containing physical layer cell identities,
for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured

\- with SA or NR-DC operation mode or configured in NE-DC operation mode
by PCell with NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR,
RSTD, or E-CID RSRP and RSRQ) on E-UTRA non-serving frequency carrier,
or

\- with SA operation mode on NR carrier frequencies with CCA by PCell
with NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR) on E-UTRA
non-serving frequency carrier, and

\- configured with an appropriate measurement gap pattern according to
Table 9.1.2-3.

The requirements in this clause for concurrent measurement gaps are only
applied for UE in NR SA operation mode.

For UE supporting *eutra-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17* and indicating
*NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for inter-RAT measurement,

\- An inter-RAT measurement is defined as measurement without gap if

\- the UE indicates 'nogap-noncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for
the inter-RAT measurement

\- An inter-RAT measurement is defined as measurement with NCSG if

\- the UE indicates 'ncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for the
inter-RAT measurement

When network configures measurement gap or NCSG, the delay requirements
are specified in clause 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

\- An inter-RAT SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap if

\- the UE indicates 'gap' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for the
inter-RAT measurement

When network configures measurement gap, the delay requirements are
specified in clauses 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

\- For inter-RAT measurements with NCSG, UE may cause scheduling
restriction as specified in clause 9.4.2.5 and 9.4.3.5.

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD
measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR, or E-CID RSRP and RSRQ) configured by
NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency carrier, then the
corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements requirements specified
in clause 8.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\] shall apply.

When *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured but UE does not support
either *measurementEnhancement-r16 or*
*interRAT-MeasurementEnhancement-r16*, the UE is not required to meet
the requirements specified in Table 9.4.2.3-2 and Table 9.4.3.3-2.

*Editor's note: the exact signalling names in the above brackets and in
Table 9.4.2.3-2 and Table 9.4.3.3-2 are subject to RAN2 definitions and
the brackets shall be replaced by the correct signalling names according
to RAN2 specification.*

Parameter T~Inter1~ used in inter-RAT requirements in clause 9.4 is
specified in Table 9.4.1-1 when measurement gap is used, and in Table
9.4.1-2 when NCSG is used.

*A UE configured with gap/NCSG pattern ID 2, 3 or 10 shall be able to
detect a target cell, provided that*

\- the E-UTRA subframe \#0 or \#5 of the target E-UTRAN cell begins not
earlier than 500 μs from the start of the measurement gap, and

\- the E-UTRA subframe \#0 or \#5 of the target E-UTRAN cell ends not
later than 500 μs before the end of the measurement gap in case of FDD
and not later than 750 μs before the end of measurement gap in case of

### 9.4.2 NR − E-UTRAN FDD measurements

#### 9.4.2.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN FDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
10.2.5 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS
36.133 \[15\].

#### 9.4.2.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps or NCSG to identify and measure
inter-RAT cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
scheduled, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are scheduled, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated, or the UE supports
capability of conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ according to the following expression:

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ FDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1,

CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ when measurement gaps are
configured, or CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ when NCSGs are configured, is the
scaling factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is
calculated as specified in clause 9.1.5.2.

> For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent measurement gaps,
> K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the scaling factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer
> to be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~
> = 1** when the UE is not **configured with concurrent measurement
> gaps. Otherwise,** K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE
> configured with concurrent measurement gaps.

For a window W of duration MGRP\_max, where MGRP\_max is the maximum
MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap(s) and per-FR
measurement gap(s) for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any
associated gap occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of associated gap occasions within the
window, including those dropped and non-dropped ocassions of the
associated measurement gap within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated measurement gap
occasions **after accounting for collisions** between the measurement
gaps **by applying the measurement gap collision rule in section
9.1.8.3**.

Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent measurement
gaps, if N~available~ =0

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

When measurement gaps are scheduled for E-UTRAN FDD inter-RAT
measurements, or the UE supports capability of conducting such
measurements without gaps, the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements to higher layers with
measurement period **T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~** given by table
9.4.2.2-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.2.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When DRX is in use and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
configured, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are configured, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ specified in Table 9.4.2.3-1. When
*highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured and UE supports the enhanced
inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurement requirements, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ specified in Table 9.4.2.3-2.

> For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent measurement gaps,
> K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the scaling factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer
> to be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~
> = 1** when the UE is not **configured with concurrent measurement
> gaps. Otherwise,** K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE
> configured with concurrent measurement gaps.

For a window W of duration MGRP\_max, where MGRP\_max is the maximum
MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap(s) and per-FR
measurement gap(s) for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any
associated gap occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of associated gap occasions within the
window, including both dropped and non-dropped instances of the
associated measurement gap within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated measurement gap
occasions **after accounting for collisions** between the measurement
gaps **by applying the measurement gap collision rule in section
9.1.8.3**.

Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent measurement
gaps, if N~available~ =0

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.2.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

##### 9.4.2.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.2.4.3.

##### 9.4.2.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap or NCSG has not
been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

#### 9.4.2.5 Scheduling Availability During NR − E-UTRAN FDD measurements with NCSG

When a serving cell and an E-UTRA FDD measurement object are in bands
with overlapping frequency, UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols
within NCSG ML. Otherwise, no scheduling restriction to the serving cell
is allowed due to NR − E-UTRAN FDD measurements with NCSG.

### 9.4.3 NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements

#### 9.4.3.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN TDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.5
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\].

#### 9.4.3.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps or NCSG to identify and measure
inter-RAT cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
scheduled, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are scheduled, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated or the UE supports
capability of conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ according to the following expression:

\- When configuration 0 or configuration 1 in Table 9.4.3.2-1 is
applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

> \- When configuration 2 or configuration 3 in Table 9.4.3.2-1 is
> applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA} + 240 \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1,

CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ when measurement gaps are
configured, or CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ when NCSGs are configured, is the
scaling factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is
calculated as specified in clause 9.1.5.2.

For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent measurement gaps,
K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the scaling factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer
to be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ =
1** when the UE is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps.
Otherwise,** K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured
with concurrent measurement gaps.

\- For a window W of duration MGRP\_max, where MGRP\_max is the maximum
MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap(s) and per-FR
measurement gap(s) for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any
associated gap occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of associated gap occasions within the
window, including those dropped and non-dropped ocassions of the
associated measurement gap within the window, and

\- N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated measurement gap
occasions **after accounting for collisions** between the measurement
gaps **by applying the measurement gap collision rule in section
9.1.8.3**.

\- Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent
measurement gaps, if N~available~ =0

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in Table 9.4.3.2-1.

+---------+---------+---------+-------+---------+---------+---------+

When measurement gaps are scheduled for E-UTRAN TDD inter-RAT
measurements, or the UE supports capability of conducting such
measurements without gaps, the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements to higher layers with
measurement period T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ given by table 9.4.3.2-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.3.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When DRX is in use and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
configured, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are configured, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ specified in Table 9.4.3.3-1. When
*highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured and UE supports the enhanced
inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurement requirements, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ specified in Table 9.4.3.3-2.

> For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent measurement gaps,
> K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the scaling factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer
> to be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~
> = 1** when the UE is not **configured with concurrent measurement
> gaps. Otherwise,** K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE
> configured with concurrent measurement gaps.

For a window W of duration MGRP\_max, where MGRP\_max is the maximum
MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap(s) and per-FR
measurement gap(s) for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any
associated gap occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of associated gap occasions within the
window, including both dropped and non-dropped instances of the
associated measurement gap within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated measurement gap
occasions **after accounting for collisions** between the measurement
gaps **by applying the measurement gap collision rule in section
9.1.8.3**.

Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent measurement
gaps, if N~available~ =0

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.3.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

##### 9.4.3.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.3.4.3.

##### 9.4.3.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.3.2 and 9.4.3.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap or NCSG has not
been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

#### 9.4.3.5 Scheduling Availability During NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements with NCSG

When UE supports *simultaneousRxTxInterBandENDC* for a band combination,
no scheduling restriction is applicable to NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements
with NCSG in this band combination; otherwise UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols within NCSG ML.

When a serving cell and an E-UTRA TDD measurement object are in bands
with overlapping frequency, UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols
within NCSG ML. Otherwise, no scheduling restriction to the serving cell
is allowed due to NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements with NCSG.

### 9.4.4 Inter-RAT RSTD measurements

#### 9.4.4.1 NR − E-UTRAN FDD RSTD measurements

##### 9.4.4.1.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSTD measurements
requested via LPP \[22, 27\].

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSTD
measurement configured by NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency
carrier, then the corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements
requirements as follows shall apply.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA PSCC shall meet E-UTRAN OTDOA
intra-frequency measurements requirements in clause 8.1.2.5. The
applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.10.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA SCC shall meet all applicable
requirements in clause 8.4, except that the terms PCell and primary
component carrier shall be deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.
The applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.12,
except that the terms PCell and primary component carrier shall be
deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.

The requirements in clause 9.4.4.1 apply when:

\- the UE is provided with the LTE timing information via LPP \[27\],
including both *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is not provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* or
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* but not with
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*.

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE may be using autonomous gaps to acquire
SFN of the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to requesting
measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements
before the ![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.4895833333333333in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} time period starts while meeting all the
requirements in clause 9.4.4.1.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance
data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to acquire the SFN
before the ![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.4895833333333333in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} starts.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps to perform
cell detection for the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to
requesting measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD
measurements before the
![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.4916666666666667in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"} time period starts while meeting all the
requirements in clause 9.4.4.1.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance
data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to detect the cell
before the ![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.4916666666666667in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"} starts.

##### 9.4.4.1.2 Requirements

When the physical layer cell identities of neighbour cells together with
the OTDOA assistance data are provided, the UE shall be able to detect
and measure inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD RSTD, specified in TS 38.215 \[4\],
for at least *n*=16 cells, including the reference cell, within
![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.4916666666666667in"

height="0.25833333333333336in"} is the total time for detecting and
measuring at least *n* cells,

![](./media/image17.wmf){width="0.3in" height="0.25in"} is the largest
value of the cell-specific positioning subframe configuration period,
defined in TS 36.211 \[23\], among the measured *n* cells including the
reference cell,

![](./media/image18.wmf){width="0.21666666666666667in" height="0.175in"}
is the number of PRS positioning occasions as defined in Table
9.4.4.1.2-1, where each PRS positioning occasion comprises of
![](./media/image19.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.25in"}
(1≤![](./media/image20.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.25in"}≤6)
consecutive downlink positioning subframes defined in TS 36.211 \[23\],

CSSF~interRAT~=CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor determined by
the gap sharing scheme for the RSTD measurements on the carrier
frequency *i* as defined in clause 9.1.5.2,

height="0.25833333333333336in"} starts from the first subframe of the
PRS positioning occasion closest in time after both the
*OTDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message and the OTDOA assistance data
in the *OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData* message via LPP as specified in
TS 38.305 \[22\], are delivered to the physical layer of the UE.

The RSTD measurement accuracy for all measured neighbor cells *i* shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy as specified in clause 10.2.4.

##### 9.4.4.1.2.1 RSTD Measurement Reporting Delay {#rstd-measurement-reporting-delay .H6}

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

##### 9.4.4.1.2.2 Requirements for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell {#requirements-for-acquiring-the-timing-of-the-e-utra-otdoa-reference-cell .H6}

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE supporting per-FR gaps may make autonomous
gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the PCell, PSCell,
and each of the SCells in FR1 for acquiring SFN of the reference cell in
the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data, while no autonomous gaps in downlink
reception or uplink transmission are allowed in any of the UE serving
cells in FR2. The UE, which are only supporting per-UE gaps, may make
autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the
PCell, PSCell, and each of the SCells for acquiring the SFN of the
reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps while
indicating *eutra-FineTimingDetection* according to TS 38.331 \[2\] for
detecting the reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is performing one or both of SFN acquisition or cell
detection as specified above, the UE shall be able to determine the
timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell during the
time period

T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ = T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ + T~MIB~ + T~ECGI~ ,

where

T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ = T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ -
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ is according to clause 9.4.2 assuming
CSSF~interRAT~=1 and it is the time needed to detect the E-UTRA OTDOA
assistance data reference cell when the UE needs to acquire the subframe
and slot timing of the cell, provided the UE is configured with
measurement gaps (T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~=0 when both
*nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset* are provided in the
E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data or the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data
reference cell is known to the UE), and

T~MIB~ = 50 ms is the time required to acquire SFN and/or PHICH
configuration of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell
provided the OTDOA assistance data reference cell is decodable and at
least all E-UTRA subframes \#0 during T~MIB~ are available at the UE
receiver (T~MIB~=0 when *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* is provided in the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data and ECGI acquisition is not needed), and

T~ECGI~ = 100 ms is the time required to acquire ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell when *cellGlobalId* is included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* and the UE is not aware of the ECGI of this
cell (T~ECGI~ = 0 when *cellGlobalId* is not included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* or the UE is aware of the ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell).

When detecting the E-UTRAN OTDOA reference cell, the requirements in
this clause shall be met, provided the conditions for the detectable
cell are fulfilled according to clause 9.4.2.1. In addition, the MIB of
the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell whose SFN is acquired shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to TS 36.101 \[25\].

The requirement for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference
cell within T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well
as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

When T~MIB~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during T~MIB~, the UE
shall transmit at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB,\ FDD~ ACK/NACKs on PCell,
PSCell, and each of activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where the
autonomous gaps are created, specified in Table 9.4.4.1.2.2-1. When both
T~MIB~\>0 and T~ECGI~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during
T~MIB~+T~ECGI~, the UE shall transmit on PCell, PSCell, and each of
activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where autonomous gaps are
created at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB+ECGI,\ FDD~ ACK/NACKs specified in
Table 9.4.4.1.2.2-3, provided the OTDOA reference cell bandwidth is
configured in the OTDOA assistance data \[22, 27\]. The requirements in
Tables 9.4.4.1.2.2-1, 9.4.4.1.2.2-2, and 9.4.4.1.2.2-3 apply, provided
that:

\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

\- no DRX cycle is used,

\- no measurement gaps are configured,

\- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,

\- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,

\- 20 ms SMTC period is configured,

\- SSBs are transmitted in one slot within SMTC window.

#### 9.4.4.2 NR − E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements

##### 9.4.4.2.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements
requested via LPP \[22, 27\].

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSTD
measurement configured by NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency
carrier, then the corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements
requirements as follows shall apply.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA PSCC shall meet E-UTRAN OTDOA
intra-frequency measurements requirements in clause 8.1.2.5. The
applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.10.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA SCC shall meet all applicable
requirements in clause 8.4, except that the terms PCell and primary
component carrier shall be deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.
The applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.12,
except that the terms PCell and primary component carrier shall be
deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.

The requirements in clause 9.4.4.1 apply when:

\- the UE is provided with the LTE timing information via LPP \[27\],
including both *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is not provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* or
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* but not with
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*.

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE may be using autonomous gaps to acquire
SFN of the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to requesting
measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements
before the ![](./media/image27.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} time period starts while meeting all the
requirements in clause 9.4.4.2.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance
data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to acquire the SFN
before the ![](./media/image27.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} starts. When the UE is not aware of and
cannot derive the subframe timing difference between the NR serving cell
and the OTDOA assistance data reference cell, the UE may need to request
measurement gaps to perform cell detection for the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell prior to requesting measurement gaps for performing the
requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements before the
![](./media/image27.wmf){width="1.5in" height="0.26666666666666666in"}
time period starts while meeting all the requirements in
clause 9.4.4.2.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance data is provided to
allow sufficient time for the UE to detect the cell before the
![](./media/image27.wmf){width="1.5in" height="0.26666666666666666in"}
starts.

##### 9.4.4.2.2 Requirements

When the physical layer cell identities of neighbour cells together with
the OTDOA assistance data are provided, the UE shall be able to detect
and measure inter-RAT -UTRAN TDD RSTD, specified in TS 38.215 \[4\], for
at least *n*=16 cells, including the reference cell, within
![](./media/image28.wmf){width="1.5in" height="0.26666666666666666in"}
ms as given below:

![](./media/image29.wmf){width="3.2916666666666665in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} ,

where

![](./media/image27.wmf){width="1.5in" height="0.26666666666666666in"}is
the total time for detecting and measuring at least *n* cells,

![](./media/image17.wmf){width="0.3in" height="0.25in"} is the largest
value of the cell-specific positioning subframe configuration period,
defined in TS 36.211 \[23\], among the measured *n* cells including the
reference cell,

![](./media/image18.wmf){width="0.21666666666666667in" height="0.175in"}
is the number of PRS positioning occasions as defined in Table
9.4.4.2.2-1, where a PRS positioning occasion is as defined in
clause 9.4.4.1.2,

CSSF~interRAT~=CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor determined by
the gap sharing scheme for the RSTD measurements on the carrier
frequency *i* as defined in clause 9.1.5.2,

![](./media/image21.wmf){width="0.15833333333333333in" height="0.175in"}
= ![](./media/image22.wmf){width="0.7083333333333334in"
height="0.475in"} ms is the measurement time for a single PRS
positioning occasion which includes the sampling time and the processing
time, and

the *n* cells are distributed on up to two E-UTRAN TDD carrier
frequencies.

The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting RSTD for the
reference cell and all the neighbor cells *i* out of at least (*n*-1)
neighbor cells within ![](./media/image31.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} provided:

![](./media/image24.wmf){width="0.925in" height="0.2833333333333333in"}
conditions apply for all subframes of at least
![](./media/image25.wmf){width="0.5083333333333333in" height="0.425in"}
PRS positioning occasions,

PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to TS 36.133 \[15, Annex B.2.6\] for a
corresponding Band,

![](./media/image26.wmf){width="0.8416666666666667in"
height="0.2833333333333333in"} is as defined in clause 9.4.4.1.2.

The time ![](./media/image32.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} starts from the first subframe of the
PRS positioning occasion closest in time after both the
OTDOA-RequestLocationInformation message and the OTDOA assistance data
in the OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData message via LPP as specified in
TS 38.305 \[22\], are delivered to the physical layer of the UE.

The RSTD measurement accuracy for all measured neighbor cells *i* shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy as specified in clause 10.2.4.

##### 9.4.4.2.2.1 RSTD Measurement Reporting Delay {#rstd-measurement-reporting-delay-1 .H6}

This requirement assumes that that the measurement report is not delayed
by other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

##### 9.4.4.2.2.2 Requirements for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell {#requirements-for-acquiring-the-timing-of-the-e-utra-otdoa-reference-cell-1 .H6}

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE supporting per-FR gaps may make autonomous
gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the PCell, PSCell,
and each of the SCells in FR1 for acquiring SFN of the reference cell in
the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data, while no autonomous gaps in downlink
reception or uplink transmission are allowed in any of the UE serving
cells in FR2. The UE, which are only supporting per-UE gaps, may make
autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the
PCell, PSCell, and each of the SCells for acquiring the SFN of the
reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps while
indicating *eutra-FineTimingDetection* according to TS 38.331 \[2\] for
detecting the reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is performing one or both of SFN acquisition or cell
detection as specified above, the UE shall be able to determine the
timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell during the
time period

T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ = T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ + T~MIB~ + T~ECGI~ ,

where

T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ = T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ -
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ is according to clause 9.4.3 assuming
CSSF~interRAT~=1 and it is the time needed to detect the E-UTRA OTDOA
assistance data reference cell when the UE needs to acquire the subframe
and slot timing of the cell, provided the UE is configured with
measurement gaps (T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~=0 when both
*nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset* are provided in the
E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data or the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data
reference cell is known to the UE), and

T~MIB~ = 50 ms is the time required to acquire SFN and/or PHICH
configuration of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell
provided the OTDOA assistance data reference cell is decodable and at
least all E-UTRA subframes \#0 during T~MIB~ are available at the UE
receiver (T~MIB~=0 when *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* is provided in the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data and ECGI acquisition is not needed), and

T~ECGI~ = 100 ms is the time required to acquire ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell when *cellGlobalId* is included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* and the UE is not aware of the ECGI of this
cell (T~ECGI~ = 0 when *cellGlobalId* is not included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* or the UE is aware of the ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell).

When detecting the E-UTRAN OTDOA reference cell, the requirements in
this clause shall be met, provided the conditions for the detectable
cell are fulfilled according to clause 9.4.3.1. In addition, the MIB of
the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell whose SFN is acquired shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to TS 36.101 \[25\].

The requirement for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference
cell within T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well
as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

When T~MIB~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during T~MIB~, the UE
shall transmit at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB,\ TDD~ ACK/NACKs on PCell,
PSCell, and each of activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where the
autonomous gaps are created, specified in Table 9.4.4.2.2.2-1. When both
T~MIB~\>0 and T~ECGI~\>0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during
T~MIB~+T~ECGI~, the UE shall transmit on PCell, PSCell, and each of
activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where autonomous gaps are
created at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB+ECGI,\ TDD~ ACK/NACKs specified in
Table 9.4.4.2.2.2-3, provided the OTDOA reference cell bandwidth is
configured in the OTDOA assistance data \[22, 27\]. The requirements in
Tables 9.4.4.2.2.2-1, 9.4.4.2.2.2-2 and 9.4.4.2.2.2-3 apply, provided
that:

\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

\- no DRX cycle is used,

\- no measurement gaps are configured,

\- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,

\- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,

\- 20 ms SMTC period is configured,

\- SSBs are transmitted in one slot within SMTC window.

measurements \[22, 27\].

##### 9.4.5.2.2 Requirements

The requirements in clause 9.4.3 also apply for this clause except the
measurement reporting requirements. The measurement reporting
requirements for E-CID RSRP and RSRQ are defined in clause 9.4.5.2.3.

##### 9.4.5.2.3 Measurement Reporting Delay

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

Reported RSRP and RSRQ measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2 and
10.2.3, respectively.

### 9.4.6 NR − UTRAN FDD measurements

#### 9.4.6.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR− UTRAN FDD CPICH RSCP and CPICH
Ec/No measurements for SRVCC.

#### 9.4.6.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

##### 9.4.6.2.1 Identification of a new UTRA FDD cell {#identification-of-a-new-utra-fdd-cell .H6}

When explicit neighbour list is provided and no DRX is used, either
measurement gaps are scheduled or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable cell belonging to the monitored set within

A cell shall be considered detectable when

\- CPICH Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB,

\- SCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -17 dB for at least one channel tap and
SCH\_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code and
secondary synchronisation code. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected.

##### 9.4.6.2.2 UE UTRA FDD CPICH measurement capability {#ue-utra-fdd-cpich-measurement-capability .H6}

When measurement gaps are scheduled for UTRA FDD inter RAT measurements,
or the UE supports capability of conducting such measurements without
gaps, the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements
to higher layers with measurement accuracy as specified in Clause 10
with measurement period given by

The UE shall be capable of performing UTRA FDD CPICH measurements for
X~basic\ measurementUTRA\_FDD~ inter-frequency cells per FDD frequency
and the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to
higher layers with the measurement period of
T~Measurement\_\ UTRA\_FDD.~

X~basic\ measurement\ UTRA\_FDD~ = 6

T~Measurement\_Period\ UTRA\_FDD~ = 480 ms. The period used for
calculating the measurement period T~measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~ for UTRA
FDD CPICH measurements.

T~basic\_identify\_UTRA\_FDD~ = 300 ms. This is the time period used in
the inter RAT equation in clause 9.4.6.2.1 where the maximum allowed
time for the UE to identify a new UTRA FDD cell is defined.

T~basic\_measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~ = 50 ms. This is the time period used
in the equation for defining the measurement period for inter RAT CPICH
measurements.

CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor for the
measured inter-RAT UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated as specified in
clause 9.1.5.2.

T~inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1.

##### 9.4.6.2.3 Periodic Reporting {#periodic-reporting-4 .H6}

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

##### 9.4.6.2.4 Event Triggered Reporting {#event-triggered-reporting-4 .H6}

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clause 10.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify,\ UTRA\_FDD~ defined in
Clause 9.4.6.2.1 for the minimum requirements. When L3 filtering is used
an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify,\ UTRA\_FDD~ defined in clause 9.4.6.2.1 for the minimum
requirements and then triggers the measurement report as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~ defined in clause 9.4.6.2.2
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ± 32 chips
while measurement gap has not been available and the L3 filter has not
been used. When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be
expected.

##### 9.4.6.2.5 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting {#event-triggered-periodic-reporting-4 .H6}

Reported measurements contained in event triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.6.2.4 Event Triggered
Reporting.

#### 9.4.6.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When explicit neighbour list is provided and DRX is used, either
measurement gaps are scheduled or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable cell belonging to the neighbour cell list
within T~identify,UTRA\_FDD~ as shown in table 9.4.6.3-1

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

The measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
the clause 10.3.

##### 9.4.6.3.1 Periodic Reporting {#periodic-reporting-5 .H6}

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

##### 9.4.6.3.2 Event Triggered Reporting {#event-triggered-reporting-5 .H6}

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clause 10.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify,UTRA\_FDD~ defined in Clause
9.4.6.3. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify,\ UTRA\_FDD~ defined in clause 9.4.6.3 and then triggers the
measurement report as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered
measurement reporting delay shall be less than T~measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~
defined in clause 9.4.6.3 provided the timing to that cell has not
changed more than ± 32 chips while measurement gap has not been
available and the L3 filter has not been used. When L3 filtering is
used, an additional delay can be expected.

##### 9.4.6.3.3 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting {#event-triggered-periodic-reporting-5 .H6}

Reported measurements contained in event triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.6.3.2 Event Triggered
Reporting.

### 9.4.7 NR -- E-UTRAN measurements with autonomous gaps

#### 9.4.7.1 CGI identification of an E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps

The requirements in this clause apply when the UE is configured with
standalone NR, NE-DC or NR-DC. The UE shall identify and report the CGI
when requested by an NR PCell for the purpose 'reportCGI'. The UE may
make autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission for
receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to clause 5.5.3.1 in
TS 38.331 \[2\]. If autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the
purpose of 'reportCGI', regardless of whether DRX is used or not, or
regardless of whether SCell(s) are configured or not, the UE shall be
able to identify a new CGI of E-UTRA cell within
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}$= 150 ms. This is the maximum
allowed time for the UE to identify a new CGI of an E-UTRA cell,
provided that the E-UTRA cell has been already identified by the UE.

A cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are
fulfilled:

\- RSRP related side conditions given in Clause 9.1 in \[15\] are
fulfilled for a corresponding Band,

\- SCH\_RP and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 in \[15\] for a
corresponding Band

The MIB of an E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be considered
decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation requirements are met
according to \[25\].

The requirement for identifying a new CGI of an E-UTRA cell within
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}$ is applicable when no DRX is used
as well as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is
used.

#### 9.4.7.2 CGI reporting delay

The E-UTRA CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command
that will trigger an E-UTRA CGI report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE
to send the measurement report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}$ plus RRC procedure delay defined in
clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\], and an additional 30ms margin.

9.4A Inter-RAT measurements for RedCap
--------------------------------------

### 9.4A.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are specified for NR−E-UTRAN FDD and
NR−E-UTRAN TDD measurements and are applicable without an explicit
E-UTRAN neighbour cell list containing physical layer cell identities,
for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured

\- with SA operation mode by PCell with NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD
measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR) on E-UTRA non-serving frequency
carrier, and

\- configured with an appropriate measurement gap pattern according to
Table 9.1A.2-1 and Table 9.1A.2-2.

Parameter T~Inter1\_RedCap~ used in inter-RAT requirements in clause
9.4A is specified in Table 9.4A.1-1.

#### 9.4A.2.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure inter-RAT
cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern is scheduled, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable FDD cell within
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ according to the following
expression:

$T_{\text{Identify}\_ RedCap,\ \ E - UTRAN\ FDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1\_ RedCap}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1\_RedCap~ is defined in clause 9.4A.1,

CSSF~interRAT\_RedCap~ = CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is the scaling
factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated
as specified in clause 9.1A.5.2.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in Table 9.4A.2.2-1 and Table
9.4A.2.2-2 for 2 Rx RedCap UE and 1 Rx RedCap UE, respectively.

The UE shall be capable of identifying and performing NR -- E-UTRAN FDD
RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements of at least 4 identified E-UTRAN
FDD cells per E-UTRA FDD carrier frequency layer during each layer 1
measurement period, for up to 7 E-UTRA FDD carrier frequency layers.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2A.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2A.3.

#### 9.4A.2.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When DRX is in use and measurement gaps are configured, the UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ specified in Table 9.4A.2.3-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2A.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2A.3.

#### 9.4A.2.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4A.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The requirements in clause 9.4.2.4.1 shall apply.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

##### 9.4A.2.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and
10.2.5, respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4A.2.4.3.

##### 9.4A.2.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5,
respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined
in clauses 9.4A.2.2 and 9.4A.2.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5
seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event
as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay
shall be less than T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ provided the timing
to that cell has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap has
not been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

### 9.4A.3 NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements

#### 9.4A.3.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN TDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.5
are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\].

\- For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
10.2A.2 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS
36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
10.2A.3 are fulfilled for a corresponding Band, together with the
corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS
36.133 \[15\],

#### 9.4A.3.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure inter-RAT
cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern is scheduled, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable TDD cell within
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ according to the following
expression:

\- When configuration 0 or configuration 1 in Table 9.4A.3.2-1 is
applied,

$T_{\text{Identify}\_ RedCap,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1\_ RedCap}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

> \- When configuration 2 or configuration 3 in Table 9.4A.3.2-1 is
> applied,

$T_{\text{Identify}\_ RedCap,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1\_ RedCap}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap} + 240 \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1\_RedCap~ is defined in clause 9.4A.1,

CSSF~interRAT\_RedCap~ = CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is the scaling
factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated
as specified in clause 9.1A.5.2.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in Table 9.4A.3.2-1 and Table
9.4A.3.2-2 for 2 Rx RedCap UE and 1 Rx RedCap UE, respectively.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

\- The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured
cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

\- The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured
cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2A.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD
RSRQ measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified
in clause 10.2A.3.

#### 9.4A.3.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4A.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The requirements in clause 9.4.3.4.1 shall apply.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

##### 9.4A.3.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and
10.2.5, respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4A.3.4.3.

##### 9.4A.3.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5,
respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined
in clauses 9.4A.3.2 and 9.4A.3.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5
seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event
as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay
shall be less than T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ provided the timing
to that cell has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap has
not been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

### 9.4A.4 NR -- E-UTRAN measurements with autonomous gaps

#### 9.4A.4.1 CGI identification of an E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps

The requirements in this clause apply when the 1Rx RedCap UE or 2Rx
RedCap UE is configured with standalone NR. The UE shall identify and
report the CGI when requested by an NR PCell for the purpose
'reportCGI'. The UE may make autonomous gaps in downlink reception and
uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to
clause 5.5.3.1 in TS 38.331 \[2\].

For 2Rx RedCap UE: If autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the
purpose of 'reportCGI', the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell within$T_{\text{identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN}}$= 150 ms.

For 1Rx RedCap UE: If autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the
purpose of 'reportCGI', the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell within $T_{\text{identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN}}$= 190 ms.

This is the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a new CGI of an
E-UTRA cell, provided that the E-UTRA cell has been already identified
by the UE.

A cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are
fulfilled:

\- RSRP related side conditions given in Clause 9.1 in \[15\] are
fulfilled for a corresponding Band,

\- SCH\_RP and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 in \[15\] for a
corresponding Band

The MIB of an E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be considered
decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation requirements are met
according to \[25\].

The requirement for identifying a new CGI of an E-UTRA cell within
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI}\text{\_RedCap}\text{,\ E-UTRAN}}$ is applicable
when no DRX is used as well as when any of the DRX cycles specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

#### 9.4A.4.2 CGI reporting delay

The E-UTRA CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command
that will trigger an E-UTRA CGI report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE
to send the measurement report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN}}$ plus RRC procedure delay
defined in clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\], and an additional 30ms margin.

#### 9.4A.4.3 CGI reporting scheduling restriction

When a UE is identifying CGI of an E-UTRA FDD cell or E-UTRA TDD cell
with autonomous gaps, within time period
T~identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRA~ specified in clause 9.4A.4.1, the UE
shall be able to transmit at least the number of ACK/NACKs specified in
Table 9.4A.4.3-1 on PCell in the frequency range where autonomous gaps
are used, provided that:

\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

\- no DRX cycle is used,

\- no measurement gaps are configured,

\- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,

\- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,

\- 20 ms SMTC period is configured.

9.5 L1-RSRP measurements for Reporting
--------------------------------------

### 9.5.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured CSI-RS, SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources for
L1-RSRP. The measurements shall be performed for a serving cell,
including PCell, PSCell, or SCell, on the resources configured for
L1-RSRP measurements within the active BWP.

The UE shall be able to measure all CSI-RS resources and/or SSB
resources of the *nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* and/or *csi-SSB-ResourceSet*
within the CSI-Resource*Config* settings configured for L1-RSRP for the
active BWP, provided that the number of resources, including the number
of SSB resources of the cell with PCI different from serving cell
configured for L1-RSRP measurements in 9.13, does not exceed the UE
capability indicated by *beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the
*reportConfigType* according to the CSI reporting configuration(s)
(*CSI-ReportConfig*) for the active BWP.

### 9.5.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.5 apply, provided:

> \- The CSI-RS or SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources configured for
> L1-RSRP measurements are measurable.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SSB the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.1 and
10.1.20.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant CSI-RS the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.2 and
10.1.20.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RS\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.2 for a
corresponding band.

A CSI-RS and SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered
measurable when the measurable resource conditions are met for both
CSI-RS resource and SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

In case the SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements outside
SMTCs are overlapped with the PDSCH/PDCCH that is associated to a PCI
different from serving cell, L1-RSRP measurement performance degradation
is expected.

### 9.5.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2 if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If
*nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if
groupBasedBeamReporting is enabled,* the UE shall use differential
L1-RSRP based reporting as defined in clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and 10.1.20
for FR2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2dB
step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in 10.1.6.

In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

#### 9.5.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1 and
10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send periodic L1-RSRP measurement reports for an
active BWP.

The UE shall transmit the periodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUCCH over the
air interface according to the periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in
TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in a Semi-Persistent L1-RSRP
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports, if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~ is defined in Table
9.5.4.1-1 for FR1. The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~ is
defined in Table 9.5.4.1-2 for FR2 when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is
not configured, and defined in Table 9.5.4.1-3 for FR2 power class 6 UE
when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is configured, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- N= 8 in Table 9.5.4.1-2 and Table 9.5.4.1-3.

> For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and when concurrent gaps
> are configured,

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with Navailable \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps and
per-FR measurement gaps within the same FR as serving cell, and starting
at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions
or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion
within the window W

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

Otherwise, for a UE not supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or when
concurrent gaps are not configured,

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

> P~1~=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
> when SSB is not overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is partially
> overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).
>
> \- P is P~L1\_sharing~\*P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is not overlapped
> with measurement gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
> (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
P~1~=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}} - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with GAP and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ xRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P~1~ is
$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with GAP and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with GAP and T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~SSB~ =
0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
P~1~=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{min(T_{\text{SMTCperiod}},xRP)}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SSB~ \< xRP) and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with GAP.

\- P is
$\ P_{L1\_ sharing}*\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion
is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \< xRP)

\- If SSB resource from the cell with different PCI is configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and P~2~ is valid accoding to 9.13.4.1, and any
symbol of the SSBs from serving cell and cell with different PCI are
overlapping or adjacent (in time domain)

\- P =
$\frac{P_{1}}{1 - \frac{P_{1}*T_{\text{SSB}}}{{P_{2}*T}_{\text{SSB}\_\text{CDP}}}}$
, if P~1~\*T~SSB~ \< P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~.

\- P = P~1~, if P~1~\*T~SSB~ \> P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~.

\- P = 2\*P~1~, if P~1~\*T~SSB~ = P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~.

> \- Otherwise, P = P~1~
>
> Where:

\- T~SSB~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell of the serving cell

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period

\- T~SSB\_CDP~ = SSB periodicity of the cell with PCI different from
serving cell

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 2, if SSB resource from the cell with different PCI
is configured for L1-RSRP measurement, and P~sharing\_factor,CDP~ is
used in 9.13.4.1, and any symbol of the SSBs from serving cell and cell
with different PCI are overlapping or adjacent (in time domain).
P~L1\_sharing~ = 1, otherwise.

\- T~SSB~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period

\- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG, an SSB or an SMTC occasion is
only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is
activated.

> \- When a measurement gap is configured and the measurement gap is not
> NCSG,
>
> \- an SSB or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped with the
> GAP if it overlaps a measurement gap occasion, and
>
> \- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG measurement gap is configured,

\- an SSB or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped with the
GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

\- When concurrent gaps are configured, an SSB or an SMTC occasion is
not considered to be overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap occasion is
dropped according to clause 9.1.8.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 9.5.4.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured CSI-RS resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table
9.5.4.2-1 for FR1 and in Table 9.5.4.2-2 for FR2, where

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources, M=1 if higher
layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is configured,
and M=3 otherwise

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources M=1

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The requirements
apply if *qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured for all the resources in
the resource set and for each resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam*
/ N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is number of resources in
the resource set. The requirements apply provided
*qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured with QCL-TypeD for all resources
in the resource set.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requirements apply provided TCI state is provided for all resources in
the resource set in the MAC CE activating the resource set and for each
resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON,
N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam* / N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
TCI state is provided with QCL-TypeD for all resources in the resource
set in the MAC CE activating the resource set.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The requirements
apply provided *qcl-info* is configured for all resources in the
resource set and for each resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=1. UE is not required
to meet the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.19.2 and 10.1.20.2 if
number of resources in the resource set is smaller than
*maxNumberRxBeam*. The requirements apply provided *qcl-info* is
configured with QCL-TypeD for all resources in the resource set.

> For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and when concurrent gaps
> are configured,

\- P value for a CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with Navailable \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps and
per-FR measurement gaps within the same FR as serving cell, and starting
at the beginning of any CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions
or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion
within the window W

**T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS**.**

Otherwise, for a UE not supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or when
concurrent gaps are not configured,

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P=1, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with a GAP and also not overlapped
with SMTC occasion.

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when CSI-RS is
partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is not overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< xRP)

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
CSI-RS is not overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P=P~sharing\ factor~, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with GAP and
CSI-RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P=1, when aperiodic CSI-RS resource is not overlapped with GAP

\-
P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}} - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (TCSI-RS \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ xRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\frac{3}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when CSI-RS is
partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is partially overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with GAP and T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~CSI-RS~ =
0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
P=$\text{\ \ }\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{min(T_{\text{SMTCperiod}},x\text{RP})}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with GAP (T~CSI-RS~ \< xRP) and
CSI-RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
GAP.

\-
P=$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \< xRP)

Where:

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the CSI-RS configured for L1-RSRP
measurement outside gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period.

T~CSI-RS~ = the periodicity of CSI-RS configured for L1-RSRP measurement

If the UE is configured with Pre-MG, a CSI-RS or an SMTC occasion is
only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is
activated.

> \- When a measurement gap is configured and the measurement gap is not
> NCSG,
>
> \- a CSI-RS or an SMTC occasion is considered to be as overlapped with
> the GAP if it overlapps a measurement gap occasion, and
>
> \- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG measurement gap is configured,

\- a CSI-RS or an SMTC occasion is considered to be as overlapped with
the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB and CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
without measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the
following clauses.

#### 9.5.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE shall be able
to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB from cell with additional PCI for BFD, CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period
for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

#### 9.5.5.2 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP

The SSB mentioned in this clause can be associated with either the
serving cell PCI or a PCI different from serving cell PCI.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is
not required to receive CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the
UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE
shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement without any
restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for
CBD measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when
beam failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the
same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource
set configured with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement without any restriction.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 serving cell(s) in different band(s),
provided that UE is capable of independent beam management on this FR2
band pair. Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is

9.5A L1-RSRP measurements for Reporting under CCA
-------------------------------------------------

### 9.5A.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured SSB resources for L1-RSRP. The measurements
shall be performed for a serving cell under CCA operating mode,
including PCell, PSCell, or SCell, on the resources configured for
L1-RSRP measurements within the active BWP.

The UE shall be able to measure all SSB resources of the
*csi-SSB-ResourceSet* within the *CSI-ResourceConfig* settings
configured for L1-RSRP for the active BWP, provided that the number of
resources does not exceed the UE capability indicated by
*beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the
*reportConfigType* according to the CSI reporting configuration(s)
(*CSI-ReportConfig*) for the active BWP.

During EN-DC operation in FR-1, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching, an additional delay can be expected.

The requirements in clause 9.5A apply for any *channelAccessMode*
configuration \[TS 38.331, 2\].

In the requirements of clause 9.5A, the term SSB occasion not available
at the UE refers to when the SSB is configured by gNB in a cell on a
carrier frequency subject to CCA, but the first two successive candidate
SSB positions for the same SS/PBCH block index within the set of
configured SSB are not available at the UE due to DL CCA failures at gNB
during the corresponding evaluation or measurement period; otherwise the
SSB occasion is considered as available at the UE.

### 9.5A.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.5A apply, provided:

> \- The SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements are
> measurable.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SSB the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.19.1 for FR1 for
a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when the measurable resource conditions are met for SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

### 9.5A.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2-2 if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If
*nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if
groupBasedBeamReporting is enabled,* the UE shall use differential
L1-RSRP based reporting as defined in clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and 10.1.20
for FR2-2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with
2dB step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in 10.1.6.

During EN-DC operation, for FR1, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected.

#### 9.5A.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1 and
10.1.20 for FR2-2, respectively.

The UE shall only send periodic L1-RSRP measurement reports for an
active BWP.

The UE shall transmit the periodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUCCH over the
air interface according to the periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in
TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5A.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in a Semi-Persistent L1-RSRP
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2-2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

When CCA is used on target frequency, if UE cannot transmit HARQ-ACK for
the MAC CE activation command due to UL CCA failure, the UE shall not
perform MAC CE activation at the MAC action time based on the originally
scheduled HARQ-ACK transmission time specified in clause 5.2.1.5.2 in TS
38.214 \[26\].

When CCA is used on target frequency, if UE cannot transmit HARQ-ACK for
the MAC CE deactivation command due to UL CCA failure, the UE shall
perform MAC CE deactivation at the MAC action time based on the
originally scheduled HARQ-ACK transmission time specified in clause
5.2.1.5.2 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5A.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2-2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5A.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5A.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CCA~ is defined in
Table 9.5A.4.1-1 for FR1, and in Table 9.5A.4.1-2 for FR2-2, where,

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- N = 8

For FR1, for a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* concurrent
measurement gap and when concurrent gaps are configured,

\- P value for an SSB resource to be measured is defined as N~total~ /
N~outside\_MG~

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1~, MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE **measurement gaps** and
per-FR **measurement gaps** within the same FR as serving cell, and
starting at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions
within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

Otherwise, for a UE not supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or when
concurrent gaps are not configured,

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xGP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the SSB.

For FR2-2,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
SSB is not overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is not overlapped with measurement
gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P is
$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ =
MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when S SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SSB~ \<MGRP)
and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\- P is
$\ \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion
is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

> Where:

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\]

T~SSB~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell

T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC1 period or SMTC2 period if
configured

\- When a measurement gap is configured,

\- an SSB is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it overlaps a
measurement gap occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- When NCSG is configured,

\- an SSB is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it overlaps the
VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, and

\- xRP = VIRP

> \- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG, an SSB is only considered to
> be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

\- When concurrent gaps are configured, an SSB or an SMTC occasion is
not considered to be overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap occasion is
dropped according to clause 9.1.8.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

UE shall report RSRP\_0 (Not valid) if L~1~\>L~1max~, where L1 and
L1~max~ are defined in Table 9.5A.4.1-1.

### 9.5A.5 Measurement restriction for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for L1-RSRP without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

#### 9.5A.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

When the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE shall be able
to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is
required to measure SSB for L1-RSRP measurement.

### 9.5A.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.5A.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB configured as RS for L1-RSRP measurement with the same
SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.5A.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols corresponding
to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier
aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other bands than the
bands in which the serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
is configured.

#### 9.5A.6.3 (Void)

#### 9.5A.6.3A Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on serving cell(s) under CCA.

#### 9.5A.6.3B Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2-2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement
on an FR2-2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on

\- symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP
measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the periodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the semi-perssitent CSI-RS resource
configured for L1-RSRP measurement when the resource is activated,
and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the aperiodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement when the reporting is triggered.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2-2 is performed, the
scheduling restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is
performed apply to all serving cells in the band on the symbols that
fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols.

For FR2-2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
is expected to receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for
L1-RSRP measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
is expected to receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for
L1-RSRP measurement.

### 9.5B.1 Introduction

The applicability of the requirements for performing L1-RSRP
measurements for reporting in subclause 9.5B is defined in Section 3.6.
The SSB and SMTC in this section applies for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if
it is not additional specified.

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured CSI-RS, SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources for
L1-RSRP. The measurements shall be performed for PCell, on the resources
configured for L1-RSRP measurements within the active BWP.

The UE shall be able to measure all CSI-RS resources and/or SSB
resources of the *nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* and/or *csi-SSB-ResourceSet*
within the CSI-Resource*Config* settings configured for L1-RSRP for the
active BWP, provided that the number of resources does not exceed the UE
capability indicated by *beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the
*reportConfigType* according to the CSI reporting configuration(s)
(*CSI-ReportConfig*) for the active BWP.

semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.19 for FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports, if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5B.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5B.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_RedCap~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~ is defined in Table
9.5B.4.1-1 for FR1 and Table 9.5B.4.1-2 for FR2, for 2 Rx RedCap, and
Table 9.5B.4.1-3 for FR1 for 1 Rx RedCap, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise.

\- N= 8.

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
SSB is not overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is not overlapped with measurement
gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC period (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P is
$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ =
MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when S SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SSB~ \<MGRP)
and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\- P is
$\ \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion
is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

Where:

\- T~SSB~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 9.5B.4.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured CSI-RS resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_RedCap~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_RedCap~ is defined
in Table 9.5B.4.2-1 for FR1 and in Table 9.5B.4.2-2 for FR2, for 2 Rx
RedCap, and in Table 9.5B.4.2-3 for 1 Rx RedCap, where

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources, M=1 if higher
layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is configured,
and M=3 otherwise

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources M=1

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The requirements
apply if *qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured for all the resources in
the resource set and for each resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam*
/ N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is number of resources in
the resource set. The requirements apply provided
*qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured with QCL-TypeD for all resources
in the resource set.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requirements apply provided TCI state is provided for all resources in
the resource set in the MAC CE activating the resource set and for each
resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON,
N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam* / N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
TCI state is provided with QCL-TypeD for all resources in the resource
set in the MAC CE activating the resource set.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The requirements
apply provided *qcl-info* is configured for all resources in the
resource set and for each resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=1. UE is not required
to meet the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.19.2 and 10.1.20.2 if
number of resources in the resource set is smaller than
*maxNumberRxBeam*. The requirements apply provided *qcl-info* is
configured with QCL-TypeD for all resources in the resource set.

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P=1, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with measurement gap and also not
overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when CSI-RS is
partially overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is not overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
CSI-RS is not overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P=P~sharing\ factor~, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with measurement
gap and CSI-RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P=1, when aperiodic CSI-RS resource is not overlapped with
measurement gap

\-
P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (TCSI-RS \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\frac{3}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when CSI-RS is
partially overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP
and T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
CSI-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)
and CSI-RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\-
P=$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is
fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \<
MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the CSI-RS configured for L1-RSRP
measurement outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

Where:

T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period.

T~CSI-RS~ = the periodicity of CSI-RS configured for L1-RSRP measurement

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

### 9.5B.5 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS and SSB for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB and CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
without measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the
following clauses.

#### 9.5B.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE shall be able
to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC, UE is required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP
measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 9.5B.5.2 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is
not required to receive CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the
UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE
shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement without any
restriction.

### 9.5B.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.5B.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For FD-FDD and TDD RedCap UEs, there are no scheduling restrictions due
to L1-RSRP measurement performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as RS for
L1-RSRP measurement with the same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

For HD-FDD RedCap UE, scheduling restrictions apply for transmission on
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS during the CBD evaluation period, as CBD evaluation is
prioritized over UL transmission. The CBD evaluation period equals the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_RedCap~ in
case L1-RSRP measurement is performed on SSB as defined in clause
9.5B.4.1, or T~L1‑RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI‑RS\_RedCap~ in case
L1-RSRP measurement is performed on CSI-RS and/or SSB as defined in
clause 9.5B.4.1.

#### 9.5B.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- For FD-FDD and TDD RedCap UEs, the UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for
CQI on symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

\- For HD-FDD RedCap UE, scheduling restrictions apply for transmission
on PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS during the CBD evaluation period, as CBD evaluation
is prioritized over UL transmission. The CBD evaluation period equals
the measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_RedCap~
in case L1-RSRP measurement is performed on SSB as defined in clause
9.5B.4.1, or T~L1‑RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI‑RS\_RedCap~ in case
L1-RSRP measurement is performed on CSI-RS and/or SSB as defined in
clause 9.5B.4.1.

#### 9.5B.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement.

\- For the case where RS for L1-RSRP measurement is CSI-RS which is
QCLed with active TCI state for PDCCH/PDSCH and not in a CSI-RS resource
set with repetition ON, and N=1 applies as specified in clause 9.5B.4.2

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed based on the CSI-RS.

\- Otherwise

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
> PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on

\- symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP
measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the periodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the semi-perssitent CSI-RS resource
configured for L1-RSRP measurement when the resource is activated,
and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the aperiodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement when the reporting is triggered.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

9.5C L1-RSRP measurements for Reporting for satellite access
------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.5C.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP

respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RS\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.19.2 for a
corresponding band.

A CSI-RS and SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered
measurable when the measurable resource conditions are met for both
CSI-RS resource and SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

### 9.5C.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.19C for
FR1 if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If *nrofReportedRS is
configured to be larger than one, or if groupBasedBeamReporting is
enabled,* the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP based reporting as
defined in clause 10.1.19C for FR1. The differential L1-RSRP is
quantized to a 4-bit value with 2dB step size. The mapping between the
reported L1-RSRP value and the measured quantity is described in 10.1.6.

#### 9.5C.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19C.

The UE shall only send periodic L1-RSRP measurement reports for an

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19C.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports, if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5C.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5C.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_SAN~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_SAN~ is defined in
Table 9.5C.4.1-1 for FR1, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of SSB resource occasions that are not overlapped with any
**measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W,
if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

**-** P~sharing\ factor~ **= 3.**

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

  Note: T~SSB~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell is the periodicity of the SSB-Index configured for L1-RSRP measurement. T~DRX~ is the DRX cycle length. T~Report~ is configured periodicity for reporting.   

9.5C.4.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured CSI-RS resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_SAN~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table
9.5C.4.2-1 for FR1, where

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources, M=1 if higher
layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is configured,
and M=3 otherwise

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources M=1

\- P value for a CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W, if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17*
and LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- **T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS**.**

**-** P~sharing\ factor~ **= 3.**

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

### 9.5C.5 Measurement restriction for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB and CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
without measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the
following clauses.

#### 9.5C.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE shall be able
to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 9.5C.5.2 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the
UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE
shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement without any
restriction.

### 9.5C.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement are described in the following clauses. For UL, the
scheduling restriction applies to UL symbols that fully or partially
overlap with the restricted symbols as defined below.

#### 9.5C.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as RS for L1-RSRP measurement
with the same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.5C.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols corresponding
to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

9.6 NE-DC: Measurements
-----------------------

### 9.6.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for UE supporting dual connectivity
with NR PCell and E-UTRA FDD or TDD PSCell. The requirements apply to
UEs that have been configured with NE-DC.

### 9.6.2 SFTD Measurements

#### 9.6.2.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for reporting of
SFN and frame time difference between NR PCell and E-UTRA PSCell in
RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements comprise measurement reporting

physical layer measurement period of the SFTD measurement shall be
T~measure\_SFTD1~ = max(0.2, 5 \* SMTC period) s.

When DRX is used in either of the NR PCell or the E-UTRA PSCell, or in
both PCell and PSCell, the physical layer measurement period
(T~measure\_SFTD1~) of the SFTD measurement shall be as specified in
Table 9.6.2.2-1.

Table 9.6.2.2-1: SFTD measurement requirement when DRX is used

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If PSCell is changed without changing carrier frequency of PSCell while
the UE is performing SFTD measurements, the UE shall still meet SFTD
measurement and accuracy requirements for the new PSCell. In this case
the UE shall restart the SFTD measurement, and the total physical layer
measurement period shall not exceed T~measure\_SFTD2~ as defined by the
following expression:

T~measure\_SFTD2~ = (M+1)\*(T~measure\_SFTD1~) +
M\*T~PSCell\_change\_NEDC~

where:

M is the number of times the E-UTRA PSCell is changed over the
measurement period (T~measure\_SFTD2~), and

T~PSCell\_change\_NEDC~ is the time necessary to change the PSCell; it
can be up to 25 ms.

If PCell is changed, or if PSCell is changed to a different carrier
frequency, the UE shall terminate the SFTD measurement.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement when DRX is used as
well as when no DRX is used shall be as specified in clause 10.1.21.1.

9.7 Cross Link Interference measurements
----------------------------------------

### 9.7.1 Introduction

The UE capable of performing CLI measurements shall be able to measure
SRS-RSRP and CLI-RSSI which are defined in TS38.215 \[4\] within active
DL BWP. The measurements requirements in this clause apply for TDD mode
only.

CLI measurements are only applicable for RRC\_CONNECTED intra-frequency:

\- when SRS-RSRP measurement resource is fully confined within BW of DL
active BWP

\- when CLI-RSSI measurement resouce is configured within active BWP

When the UE measures SRS-RSRP and CLI-RSSI, a constant offset relative
to the downlink reference timing in the serving cell shall be applied.
The constant offset value is derived by UE implementation and shall be
at least Tc\*N~TA\_offset~.

For performing CLI measurement in FR2, UE can assume the configured CLI
measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD to one of the latest
received PDSCH and the latest monitored CORESET.

CLI measurement requirements defined in clause 9.7 are applicable if

\- CLI measurement is not performed on an NR carrier in the same band as
E-UTRA serving carrier; and

\- UE supports simultaneous Rx/Tx for inter-band CA, inter-band EN-DC,
inter-band NE-DC, and NR-DC.

### 9.7.2 SRS-RSRP measurements

#### 9.7.2.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform SRS-RSRP
measurements of configured *srs-ResourceConfigCLI*. The requirements
apply when the subcarrier spacing for SRS-RSRP measurement resource
configuration is the same as the subcarrier spacing of the active DL BWP
of serving cell. The UE is not required to measure SRS using different
SCS compared to the downlink active BWP SCS of the same carrier.

#### 9.7.2.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.7.2 apply, provided:

\- SRS resources configured for SRS-RSRP measurements are measurable.

An SRS resource configured for SRS-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SRS the following conditions are met:

\- SRS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.22.1 for FR1
and FR2 for a corresponding band,

\- SRS\_RP and SRS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.7 for a corresponding
band.

#### 9.7.2.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send SRS-RSRP reports only for report configurations
according to *reportType* which is *cliPeriodical* or
*cliEventTriggered* when SRS-RSRP report is configured.

The UE shall report the SRS-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.22.1 for
FR1 and FR2.

##### 9.7.2.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported SRS-RSRP measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.1.

##### 9.7.2.3.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting 

Reported SRS-RSRP measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.22.1.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.7.2.3.3.

##### 9.7.2.3.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported SRS-RSRP measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.1.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report on.

#### 9.7.2.4 Measurement capability

The UE shall be capable of performing SRS-RSRP measurements on the SRS
resources configured for measurement, provided that the number of SRS to
be monitored by UE does not exceed 8 within a slot, and the total number
of SRSs to be monitored by the UE does not exceed 32.

#### 9.7.2.5 SRS-RSRP measurement period

The UE shall be capable of performing SRS-RSRP measurement based on the
configured SRS resource, and the UE shall be capable of reporting
SRS-RSRP measured over measurement period of

  Note: T~SRS~ is SRS measurement periodicity configured *SRS-PeriodicityAndOffset*, and T~DRX~ is the DRX cycle length.   

If the SRS resources configured for measurement are partially or fully
overlapping with SMTC window, SSB or CSI-RS configured for RLM, BFD, CBD
or L1-RSRP measurement or measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~SRS\_RSRP\_measurement\_period.~

### 9.7.3 CLI-RSSI measurements

#### 9.7.3.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform CLI-RSSI
measurement of configured *rssi-ResourceConfigCLI*. The subcarrier
spacing for CLI-RSSI measurement resource configuration can be same or
different from the subcarrier spacing of active BWP. UE shall perform
CLI-RSSI measurement with the SCS of the active BWP.

#### 9.7.3.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.7.3 apply, provided:

\- The measurement resources configured for CLI-RSSI measurements are
measurable.

A measurement resource configured for CLI-RSSI shall be considered
measurable when for each relevant CLI-RSSI resource the following
conditions are met:

\- CLI-RSSI related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.22.2 for FR1
and FR2 for a corresponding band.

#### 9.7.3.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send CLI-RSSI reports only for report configurations
according to *reportType* which is *cliPeriodical* or
*cliEventTriggered* when CLI-RSSI report is configured.

The UE shall report the CLI-RSSI value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-100, -25\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.22.2 for
FR1 and FR2.

##### 9.7.3.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CLI-RSSI measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.2.

##### 9.7.3.3.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting 

Reported CLI-RSSI measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.22.2.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.7.3.3.3.

##### 9.7.3.3.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported CLI-RSSI measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.2.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report on.

#### 9.7.3.4 Measurement capability

The UE shall be capable of performing CLI-RSSI measurement based on the
configured resource, provided that the maximum number of CLI-RSSI
measurement resources for the UE does not exceed 64.

#### 9.7.3.5 CLI-RSSI measurement period

The UE shall be capable of performing CLI-RSSI measurement based on the
configured measurement resource within
T~CLI\_RSSI\_measurement\_period~. The UE shall be able to provide a
single RSSI sample for each measurement resource configured for CLI-RSSI
measurement occurring with a configured periodicity. The CLI-RSSI
measurement period T~CLI\_RSSI\_measurement\_period~ corresponds to the
CLI-RSSI measurement resource periodicity, which is configured for by
higher layers via *RSSI-PeriodicityAndOffset*.

If the CLI-RSSI measurement resources configured for measurement are
partially or fully overlapping with SMTC window, SSB or CSI-RS
configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement or measurement gaps,
requirements are not specified for T~CLI\_RSSI\_measurement\_period.~

### 9.7.4 Scheduling availability of UE during CLI measurements

edicated resource configured as IMR for L1-SINR computation, and the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting L1-SINR measured over the
measurement period of

configured, and M=3 otherwise;

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR, M=1.

For the value of N in FR2

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON,
N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam* / N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
TCI state is provided for all resources in the resource set in the MAC
CE activating the resource set.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requriements apply provided *qcl-info* is configured for all resources
in the resource set and for each resource has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=1. UE is not
required to meet the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.28.1 and
10.1.28.3 if number of resources in the resource set is smaller than
*maxNumberRxBeam*. The requriements apply provided *qcl-info* is
configured for all resources in the resource set.

For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and when concurrent gaps are
configured,

\- P value for a CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with Navailable \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps and
per-FR measurement gaps within the same FR as serving cell, and starting
at the beginning of any CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions
or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion
within the window W

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS**.**

Otherwise, for a UE not supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or when
concurrent gaps are not configured,

For the value of P in FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAP configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the CSI-RS.

For the value of P in FR2,

\- P=1, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with GAP and also not overlapped
with SMTC occasion.

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xGP}}}$, when CSI-RS is
partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is not overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< xRP)

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
CSI-RS is not overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~,, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with GAP and
CSI-RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xGP}} - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ xRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
P=$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xGP}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with GAP and T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and
T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{min(T_{\text{SMTCperiod}},xRP)}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with GAP (T~CSI-RS~ \< xRP) and
CSI-RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
GAP .

\-
P=$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xGP}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with GAP and CSI-RS is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \< xRP)

Where:

P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement
outside gap is

not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC1 period or SMTC2 period if
configured.

\- T~CSI-RS~ = the periodicity of CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR
measurement

\- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG, a CSI-RS reourse or an SMTC
occasion is only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG
is activated.

> \- When a measurement gap is configured and the measurement gap is not
> NCSG,
>
> \- a CSI-RS is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it overlaps
> a measurement gap occasion, and
>

\- Otherwise, when NCSG measurement gap is configured,

\- a CSI-RS is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

\- When concurrent gaps are configured, a CSI-RS resource or an SMTC
occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap
occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous conditions.

9.8.4.2 L1-SINR reporting with SSB based CMR and dedicated IMR
configured

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements with the SSB
configured as CMR and dedicated resource configured as IMR for L1-SINR
computation, in which the NZP-CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource configured as
dedicated IMR shall be 1-to-1 mapped to SSB configured as CMR, with the
same periodicity. The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
L1-SINR measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CMR\_IMR~.

The requirements in this clause are not applicable if NZP-CSI-RS or
CSI-IM resource configured as dedicated IMR is scheduled with different
periodicity as SSB configured as CMR.

The value of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CMR\_IMR~ is defined
in Table 9.8.4.2-1 for FR1 and in Table 9.8.4.2-2 for FR2 when
*highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured, and defined in Table
9.8.4.2-3 for FR2 power class 6 UE when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is
configured, where

For the value of M

\- For periodic or semi-persistent NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource as
dedicated IMR, M=1 if the higher layer parameters
*timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* and/or
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured, and M=3
otherwise;

For the value of N in FR2

> \- N = 8.

P is defined as the maximum value between P~CMR~ and P~IMR~, i.e., P =
max(P~CMR~, P~IMR~), where

\- the value of P~CMR~ shall be derived in the same way as the value of
P used for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement in clause 9.5.4.1, in which the
occasions and period of the SSB for CMR shall be used instead.

\- the value of P~IMR~ shall be derived in the same way as the value of
P used for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement in clause 9.5.4.2, in which
the occasions and period of the NZP CSI-RS for NZP-IMR or CSI-IM for
ZP-IMR shall be used instead.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For L1-SINR measurement with SSB as CMR and CSI-RS or CSI-IM as IMR, the
requirement shall apply if the CSI-RS is configured as IMR with
repetition field as "repetition = OFF" or CSI-IM is configured as IMR.

For L1-SINR measurement with SSB as CMR and CSI-RS/CSI-IM as IMR, no
requirement shall apply if SSB occasions for CMR or CSI-RS/CSI-IM
occasions for IMR are fully overlapped with the configured measurement
gap

#### 9.8.4.3 L1-SINR reporting with CSI-RS based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements with the
CSI-RS resource configured as CMR and dedicated resource configured as
IMR for L1-SINR computation, in which the NZP-CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource
configured as dedicated IMR shall be 1-to-1 mapped to CSI-RS resource
configured as CMR, with the same periodicity. The UE physical layer
shall be capable of reporting L1-SINR measured over the measurement
period of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_IMR~.

The requirements in this clause are not applicable if NZP-CSI-RS or
CSI-IM resource configured as dedicated IMR is scheduled with different
periodicity as CSI-RS resource configured as CMR.

The value of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_IMR~ is
defined in Table 9.8.4.3-1 for FR1 and in Table 9.8.4.3-2 for FR2, where

For the value of M,

\- M=1 shall be applied if

\- aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS as CMR or dedicated IMR, or

\- aperiodic CSI-IMR as dedicated IMR, or

\- periodic and semi-persistent NZP-CSI-RS as CMR or dedicated IMR and
the higher layer parameters *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
and/or *timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured, or

\- periodic and semi-persistent CSI-IM as dedicated IMR and the higher
layer parameters *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* and/or
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured;

\- M=3 otherwise.

For the value of N in FR2

> \- For periodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
> with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
> requirements apply if *qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured for all
> the resources in the resource set and for each resource one RS has
> QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON,
N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam* / N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
*qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured for all resources in the resource
set.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requirements apply provided TCI state is provided for all resources in
the resource set in the MAC CE activating the resource set and for each
resource has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON,
N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam* / N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
TCI state is provided for all resources in the resource set in the MAC
CE activating the resource set.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requriements apply provided *qcl-info* is configured for all resources
in the resource set and for each resource has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=1. UE is not
required to meet the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.28.1 and
10.1.28.3 if number of resources in the resource set is smaller than
*maxNumberRxBeam*. The requriements apply provided *qcl-info* is
configured for all resources in the resource set.

P is defined as the maximum value between P~CMR~ and P~IMR~, i.e., P =
max(P~CMR~, P~IMR~), where

\- The value of P~CMR~ and P~IMR~ shall be derived in the same way as
the value of P used for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement in clause
9.5.4.2, in which the occasions and period of the CSI-RS for CMR and NZP
CSI-RS for NZP-IMR or CSI-IM for ZP-IMR shall be used instead
respectively.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-RS as IMR, the
requirement shall apply only if CSI-RS resources as CMR and IMR are
configured with the same repetition field and the number of CSI-RS
resources in the resource sets for CMR and IMR are same.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-IM as IMR, the
requirement shall apply only if the number of CSI-RS resources in the
resource set for CMR and the number of CSI-IM resources in the resource
set for IMR are same.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-RS/CSI-IM as IMR, no
requirement shall apply if CSI-RS occasions for CMR or CSI-RS/CSI-IM
occasions for IMR are fully overlapped with the configured measurement
gap.

information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS configured for
L1-SINR measurement without any restriction.

#### 9.8.5.3 Measurement restriction if CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement
is in the same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement, UE is not required to measure CSI-IM for L1-SINR
measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR
measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement on one CC is

### 9.8.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-SINR measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-SINR
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.8.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-SINR measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement with the
same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.8.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-SINR
measurement based on SSB configured for L1-SINR measurement. For UEs
which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the
following restrictions apply due to L1-SINR measurement based on SSB
configured for L1-SINR measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking /CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be
measured for L1-SINR measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-SINR measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier
aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other bands than the
bands in which the serving cell where L1-SINR measurement is performed
is configured.

9.8.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement on
FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-SINR measurement.

\- For the cases of [ ]{.underline} CSI-RS used for L1-SINR measurement
of CSI-RS based CMR only case and CSI-RS based CMR plus CSI-RS based
ZP-IMR/NZP-IMR case and CSI-RS based CMR plus ZP-IMR case, where CSI-RS
is QCLed with active TCI state for PDCCH/PDSCH and not in a CSI-RS
resource set with repetition ON, and N=1 applies as specified in
clause 9.8.4

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-SINR measurement
performed based on the CSI-RS.

\- Otherwise

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the symbols to be
measured for L1-SINR for FR2 power class 6 UE which is not configured
with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*, and for the UE not supporting FR2 power
class 6;

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the symbols to be
measured for L1-SINR, and on 1 data symbol before symbols to be measured
for L1-SINR and 1 data symbol after symbols to be measured for L1-SINR
for FR2 power class 6 UE configured with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-SINR measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

for the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-SINR
measurement; and

shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-SINR
measurement.

#### 9.8.6.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
L1-SINR measurement performed on FR2 serving cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
L1-SINR measurement performed on FR1 serving cell(s).

9.9 NR measurements for positioning
-----------------------------------

### 9.9.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for UE capable of performing NR
positioning measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], including RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, NR E-CID, and PRS-RSRPP
measurements.

#### 9.9.1.1 General Aspects of Gap-based Measurement

For gap-based RSTD, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, and PRS-RSRPP
measurements, the requirements in clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5 and
9.9.6.5 apply provided:

\- the UE is configured or pre-configured with measurement gaps or
configured with concurrent measurement gaps

\- all positioning frequency layers are measured or associated with only
one per-UE measurement gap, or

\- for the UE supporting *independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, all positioning
frequency layers in the same FR are measured or associated with only one
per-FR measurement gap in the corresponding FR.

\- if the measurement gap is pre-configured, the gap must be activated
throughout the measurement period, and

\- if concurrent measurement gaps are configured, one of the gap
combinations specified in clause 9.1.8.2 is configured, and

\- if the UE does not support *independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, the
configured or pre-configured gap used to perform the PRS measurements
must be of per-UE type, and

\- No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement gaps for PRS
measurement, and

All measurement requirements specified in clause 9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5,
9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 shall apply without DRX as well as for any DRX
configuration specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are fully or partially
overlapped with measurement gaps, and the requirements in clause
9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 are applicable to PRS resources
that are fully or partially overlapped with measurement gaps.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with
measurement gaps if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a
measurement gap occasion. A PRS resource instance is considered to be
overlapped with measurement gap occasion if the minimum number of
unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into account *nr-DL-
PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty* and *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD* is fully
covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time, where the minimum number
is given in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.23, 10.1.24,
10.1.25 and 10.1.38 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference and
PRS-RSRPP, respectively.

When UE is configured with measurement for more than one positioning
requests, the measurement period for each request may be longer than
measurement period when UE is configured with measurement for single
positioning request.

If a positioning measurement gap is configured via *PosGapConfig* and
activated by MAC CE, the measurement requirements in clause 9.9.2.5,
9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 apply provided that no other MGs are
configured, and only one measurement gap configured via *PosGapConfig*
is activated.

#### 9.9.1.2 General Aspects of Gapless Measurement

The requirements for RSTD, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, and
PRS-RSRPP measurement without measurement gaps specified in clauses
9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6 shall apply provided that:

> Positioning frequency layer to be measured is within an active BWP,

UE is configured with PPW, and the PPW for the active BWP containing the
positioning frequency layer to be measured is activated,

No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement period specified
in clauses 9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6,

PRS is within PPW and does not overlap with other signals/channels of
higher priority,

\- for PPW type 1A/1B, the PPW does not overlap with any symbol for
SSB-based RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB
based RRM measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement
gaps,

\- for PPW type 2, PRS does not overlap with any symbol for SSB-based
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB based RRM
measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement gaps,

max∣ΔT∣≤ THR, where

∆T is the time difference between the start of a slot containing PRS
from the neighbor cell/TRP and the start of the closest slot from the
serving cell;

the range of ∆T is determined by the expected RSTD and expected RSTD
uncertainty in the assistance data;

THR is the threshold as reported in UE capability
*prs-MeasurementWithoutMG-r17*.

SCS of PRS within PPW and SCS of DL active BWP are the same.

All measurement requirements specified in clauses 9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6,
9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6 shall apply without DRX as well as for any DRX
configuration specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

The UE is not required to perform additional SSB measurement for the SSB
configured as QCL source of PRS resources.

The UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are unmuted and
fully or partially overlapped with PPW, and the requirements in clauses
9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6 are applicable to PRS resources
that are unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with PPW.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with PPW
if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a PPW occasion. A PRS
resource instance is considered to be overlapped with PPW occasion if
the minimum number of unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into
account Rx time difference between serving and non-serving cell is fully
covered by the PPW , where the minimum number is given in the accuracy
requirements in clause 10.1.23, 10.1.24, 10.1.25 and 10.1.38 for RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP, respectively.

When UE is configured with measurement for more than one positioning
requests, the measurement period for each request may be longer than
measurement period when UE is configured with measurement for single
positioning request.

#### 9.9.1.3 Scheduling Availability of UE during PRS Measurement without Measurement Gaps

The requirements in this clause apply for UE performing RSTD, PRS-RSRP,
UE Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurement without measurement
gaps.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1A-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
options 1, 2 and 3 is configured with a *type1A* PRS processing window
with priority value '*st1*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS from any serving cell on all symbols
within PRS processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1A-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
option 2 is configured with a *type1A* PRS processing window with
priority value '*st2*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to
receive PDSCH/CSI-RS from any serving cell on all symbols within PRS
processing window but shall receive PDCCH and URLLC PDSCH within PRS
processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1B-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
options 1, 2 and 3 is configured with a *type1B* PRS processing window
with priority value '*st1*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS from serving cells in the same band as DL
PRS on all symbols within PRS processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1B-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
option 2 is configured with a *type1B* PRS processing window with
priority value '*st2*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to
receive PDSCH/CSI-RS from serving cells in the same band as DL PRS but
shall receive PDCCH and URLLC PDSCH from a certain band on all symbols
within PRS processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType2-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
options 1, 2 and 3 is configured with a *type2* PRS processing window
with priority value '*st1*' for PRS measurement, then the UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS from the serving cell containing
DL PRS in case of FR1 or from serving cells in the same band as DL PRS
in case of FR2 on the symbols overlapped with DL PRS within PRS
processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType2-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
option 2 is configured with a *type2* PRS processing window with
priority value '*st2*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to
receive PDSCH/CSI-RS from the serving cell containing DL PRS in case of
FR1 or from serving cells in the same band as DL PRS in case of FR2 on
the symbols overlapped with DL PRS within PRS processing window but
shall receive PDCCH and URLLC PDSCH on the symbols overlapped with DL
PRS within PRS processing window.

When PRS is lower priority than the DL signals/channels the following
applies when UEs have an activated PRS processing window with *type1A*
or *type1B*:

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS in the PPW no later than N~2~ symbols,
defined in clause 6.4 of \[26, TS38.214\] for the subcarrier spacing
$\mu$ of the DL PRS, before the start of the PPW, UE expects to receive
the DL signals/channels and drop all DL PRS in the PPW.

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS in the PPW later than N~2~ symbols, defined
in clause 6.4 of \[26, TS38.214\] for the subcarrier spacing $\mu$ of
the DL PRS, before the start of the PPW, UE is not required to receive
the other DL signals/channels except SSB of higher priority and may
receive the DL PRS in the PPW.

When PRS is lower priority than the DL signals/channels the following
applies when UEs have an activated PRS processing window with *type2*:

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS on a PRS symbol no later than N~2~ symbols,
defined in clause 6.4 of \[26, TS38.214\] for the subcarrier spacing
$\mu$ of the DL PRS, before the PRS symbol, UE expects to receive the DL
signals/channels and drop the PRS symbol.

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS on a PRS symbol later than N~2~ symbols,
defined in clause 6.4 of \[26, TS38.214\] for the subcarrier spacing
$\mu$ of the DL PRS, before the PRS symbol, UE is not required to
receive the other DL signals/channels except SSB of higher priority and
may receive the PRS symbol.

For inter-band case for FR2 for the DL signals/channels from a different
FR2 band than the FR2 band of the DL PRS, if the same Rx beam is used
for both FR2 bands and the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority,
UEs are not expected to receive the DL signals/channels if they are
expected to measurement the DL PRS in a configured DL PRS processing
window with *type1B* or *type2*.

### 9.9.2 RSTD measurements

#### 9.9.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.9.2 shall apply provided the UE has
received *NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to measure and report DL RSTD measurements
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

#### 9.9.2.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9.2 apply for periodic and triggered RSTD
measurements, provided:

\- PRS-RSTD related side conditions given in clause 10.1.23 for FR1 and
FR2 are fulfilled, for a corresponding Band.

#### 9.9.2.3 Measurement Capability

UE PRS RSTD measurement capability is as indicated by the UE in
*NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities*, according to TS 37.355\[34\].

#### 9.9.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the
moment when the periodic measurement report is triggered and the moment
when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or
subslot when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with
subframe or slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay
excludes any delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the

the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in the
assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause

each reporting period and activate the location report at the time when
the periodic timer expires.

Note: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured, the measurement period can be
longer. When PRS-RSRP is configured for DL-TDOA, RSTD and RSRP are
performed over the same measurement period.

The measurement requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS
symbols are dropped during the measurement period T~RSTD,Total~ within
measurement gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, the
measurement period can be longer.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if the PRS
resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration
$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if time
span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the minimum number
of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is greater than
UE reported capability N.

The requirements in clause 9.9.2 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any

slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The reported PRS-RSRP measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clauses 10.1.24.3.

The PRS-RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured PRS resources shall

$T_{i}$ corresponds to *durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsInEveryTms* in TS
37.355 \[34\],

$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}} = \ \text{LCM}\left( T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}},\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}} \right)\text{\ is}$
the least common multiple between $T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$ and
$\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}}$ ,

$T_{PRS,i}$ is the maximum PRS resource periodicity among all PRS
resources in positioning frequency layer i,

$\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}}$ is the measurement gap repetition period in
positioning frequency layer *i*.

If positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL PRS resource set
with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among the DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where:

> *DL-PRS-MutingOption1-r16*.

Note: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
fully or partially covered by the MG are considered.

When PRS-RSRP measurements are configured for DL-AoD, except for
deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 \[TS 23.273\], the time
$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ starts from the first MG instance aligned
with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 \[TS 23.273\], the time$\ T_{PRS - RSRP,total}$
starts from the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in
the assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 \[TS 23.273\], the UE shall perform the PRS-RSRP measurement in
each reporting period and activate the location report at the time when
the periodic timer expires.

Note: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with RSTD
measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the* RSTD
measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.2.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the UE
Rx-Tx time difference* measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.4.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

-   if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
    duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

-   if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
    minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy
    requirements) is greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured either per UE request or not per
UE request, the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in this section apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period $T_{PRS - RSRP,\ total}$ within
measurement gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a
longer measurement period may be used.

The requirements in clause 9.9.3 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If handover occurs while PRS-RSRP measurements are being performed then
the UE shall complete the ongoing PRS-RSRP measurements session. The
PRS-RSRP measurement period can be longer. The UE shall meet the
PRS-RSRP measurement accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.24.

#### 9.9.3.6 Measurement Period Requirements without Measurement Gaps

When the physical layer receives *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData*
message and *NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF* via
LPP \[34\], the UE shall be able to measure multiple (up to the UE
capability specified in Clause 9.9.3.3) PRS-RSRP measurements as defined
in TS 38.215 \[4\] without measurement gap, on configured positioning
frequency layer *i*, within $T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ ms.

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$
*if any of the positioning frequency layers are in Case 1, or*

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = max\left( T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \text{T}_{\text{uncertainty,i}} \right)$*,
if all the positioning frequency layers are in Case 2,*

Where,

$i$ is the index of positioning frequency layer, and

$L$ is total number of positioning frequency layers, and

$T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the PRS RSTD measurement in
positioning frequency layer i, and

$\text{T}_{\text{uncertainty,i}}$ is the time from the start of the
first PPW occasion for positioning frequency layer i to the start of

A positioning frequency layer is in Case 1 if UE reports
*ppw-durationOfPRS-Processing1-r17* for the band containing the
positioning frequency layer, and a positioning frequency layer is in
Case 2 if UE reports *ppw-durationOfPRS-Processing2-r17* for the band
containing the positioning frequency layer.

$T_{PRS - RSRP,i}$ is the measurement period for PRS-RSRP measurement in
positioning frequency layer *i* as specified below.

$T_{PRS - RSRP,i} = {\left( N_{\text{RxBeam},i}*\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS,i}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last}}$

> where

$T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the PRS-RSRP measurement in
positioning frequency layer *i*.

$N_{RxBeam,i}\ $is the scaling factor for Rx beam sweeping, and
$N_{RxBeam,i}$=1 if positioning frequency layer *i* is in FR1. If
positioning frequency layer *i* is in FR2,$\ N_{RxBeam,i}$ is equal to
the value reported by the UE in *supportedLowerRxBeamSweepingFactor-FR2*
if the UE supports the capability for the band containing positioning
frequency layer i, and the LMF indicates *lowerRxBeamSweepingFactor-FR2*
in *NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation*. $N_{RxBeam,i}$ **is** equal
to 8, otherwise.

$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS to be
measured in the positioning frequency layer i to be measured during
$T_{available\_ PRS,i}$, and is calculated in the same way as PRS
duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\]. For
calculation of $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$,

*only unmuted PRS resource instances that meet the applicability
conditions and fully or partially overlapped with PRS processing window
are considered*, if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1, or*

only the PRS resources unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with
the first (PPWL-T2) ms of PPW are considered, if positioning frequency
layer i is in Case 2, where PPWL is the PPW length and T2 corresponds to
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2*.

$N_{PRS,i}^{\text{slot}}$ is the maximum number of DL PRS resources of
positioning frequency layer i configured in a slot,

$\{ N,T\}$ is UE capability combination per band where N is a duration
of DL PRS symbols in ms corresponding to
***ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN*** in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or corresponding to
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN2* in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2*,

$N’$ is UE capability for number of DL PRS resources that it can process
in a slot as indicated by ***ppw-maxNumOfDL-PRS-ResProcessedPerSlot***
in clause 6.4.3 of TS 37.355 \[34\],

$N_{\text{sample}}$ is the number of PRS RSRP measurement samples, where

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 1 if the UE supports
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* \[34\], and the LMF
requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number
of samples, and meets the following conditions:

\- PRS bandwidth is within the active BWP and

\- Magnitude of difference between the serving cell's SS-RSRP and the
neighbor cell's PRS-RSRP is within 6 dB.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 2 if the UE supports
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* \[34\], and the LMF
requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number
of samples, and does not meet the following conditions:

\- PRS bandwidth is within the active BWP and

\- Magnitude of difference between the serving cell's SS-RSRP and the
neighbor cell's PRS-RSRP is within 6 dB.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 4 otherwise.

$\text{T}_{\text{last}}$ is the measurement duration for the last
PRS-RSRP sample, including the sampling time and processing time.

If *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1 and* all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = $T_{\text{i}}$ +PPWL,
else

if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2 and*$\ $all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = PPWL;

otherwise, $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ **=** $T_{\text{i}}$ **+**
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$**.**

$T_{effect,i} = \ \left\lceil \frac{T_{i}}{T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}} \right\rceil*T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$
is the periodicity of PRS-RSRP measurement in positioning frequency
layer *i*,

$T_{i}$ corresponds to ***ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT*** in TS
37.355 \[34\] if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or
corresponds to the sum of *ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2* and
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN2* in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2*

$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}} = \ \text{LCM}\left( T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}},\text{PPWRP}_{\text{i}} \right)$
is the least common multiple between $T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$ and
$\text{PPWRP}_{i}$,

$T_{PRS,i}$ is the maximum PRS resource periodicity among all PRS
resources in positioning frequency layer i,

$\text{PPWRP}_{i}$ is the PRS processing window repetition period in
positioning frequency layer *i*.

If positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL PRS resource set
with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among the DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where:

$T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the periodicity of PRS resource sets
given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-Periodicity*.

$N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
muting. If bitmap $\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$ for higher-layer parameter
*DL-*$N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
muting.
$N_{\text{muting}} = T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}*L_{\text{muting}}$,
where $T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the muting repetition factor
given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-MutingBitRepetitionFactor*,
and $L_{\text{muting}}$ is the size of the bitmap
$\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$.

Note: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
that meet the applicability conditions and fully or partially covered by
the PRS processing window are considered.

When PRS-RSRP measurements are configured for DL-AoD, the time
$T_{PRS - RSRP,i}$ starts from the first PRS processing window instance
aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

> Note: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
> scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with RSTD
measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the* RSTD
measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.2.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the UE
Rx-Tx time difference* measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.4.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration
$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

The requirements in clause 9.9.3 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the PPW is reconfigured or reactivated, the PRS-RSRP
*measurement period can be longer*.

If any *positioning frequency layer is in Case 2, the requirements in
this clause apply provided that the PPWL corresponding to the
positioning frequency layer is larger than (T2+X) ms.*

*The requirements in this clause apply provided that a single
positioning frequency layer is configured for measurement in each PPW.*

#### 9.9.3.7 Void

#### 9.9.3.8 Measurements Period Requirements with both MG and PPW

If the UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the UE shall measure positioning frequency layer
*i* within

\- MG, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with MG, or

\- PPW, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with PPW.

The measurement period $T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}}$ is defined as:

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,MG} + \ T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,PPW} + \ T_{\text{guard}}$*,*

Where

*-* $T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,MG}$ is defined in clause 9.9.3.5 and includes
all positioning frequency layers to be measured within MG,

The requirements apply provided the following conditions are satisfied:

\- MGs and PPWs do not overlap in time;

\- Each PFL in the assistance data can be measured completely (all PRS
resources) either within MG or within activated PPW.

### 9.9.4 UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements

#### 9.9.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to measure and report one or more UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

#### 9.9.4.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9.4 apply for periodic and triggered UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurements, provided:

> \- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement related side conditions given
> in clause 10.1.25 are met for a corresponding band.

\- SRS is configured on at least one of the PCell, PSCell and SCell.

\- The UE transmits SRS within \[-160, 160\] msec of at least one DL PRS
resource of each of the TRPs in the assistance data.

UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement capability is as indicated by the
UE in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,* according to TS 37.355 \[34\].

#### 9.9.4.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~where TTI~DCCH~is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy for all measured DL
PRS resources shall be fulfilled according to the accuracy requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25.

#### 9.9.4.5 Measurement Period Requirements

within the measurement period $T_{UERxTx,Total}$ ms.

$T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,\ Total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$*.*

where $i$ is the index of positioning frequency layer,

>
> L is total number of positioning frequency layers, and
>
> $T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the UE Rx-Tx time difference
> measurement in positioning frequency layer *i* as defined further in
> this clause.

$$T_{UERxTx,i} = {\left( {{k_{multiTEG,i}*\text{CSSF}}_{i}*{ceil(\ K}_{p,PRS,i})*N}_{\text{RxBeam},i}*\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS\text{,i}}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last},i}$$

Where

same DL PRS resource simultaneously from multiple Rx TEGs, and

$k_{\text{multiTEG},i\ }$=$\left\lceil \frac{N_{TEG,i}}{k_{TEG,simul,i}} \right\rceil$

defined as $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = **N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured
with concurrent measurement gap, and** $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = 1 **for UE not
configured with concurrent measurement gap**.

For a window W of duration max($T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$~,~ MGRP\_max),
where MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and
per-FR MG within the same FR as the positioning frequency layer, and
starting at the beginning of any associated gap occasions covering the
PRS occasion:

**N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions within the window,** including both dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within **the
window, and**

**N~available~ is the number of non-dropped** associated gap occasions
covering **PRS occasions within the window W, after further accounting

Requirements do not apply if **N~available~** =0.

$N_{RxBeam,i}\ $is the scaling factor for Rx beam sweeping, and
$N_{RxBeam,i}$=1 if positioning frequency layer *i* is in FR1 and if
positioning frequency layer *i* is in FR2, $N_{RxBeam,i}$ is equal to

equal to 8, otherwise.

$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS resources
in the positioning frequency layer *i*, to be measured during
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$, and is calculated in the same way
as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\]. *For

positioning frequency layer i configured in a slot,

$\text{T}_{\text{last,i}}$ is the measurement duration for the last UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurement sample in the positioning layer i,
including the sampling time and processing time,
$\text{T}_{\text{last,i}}$ *=* $T_{\text{i}}$ *+*
$T_{available\_ PRS\text{,i}}$ ,

$T_{effect,i}$ is periodicity of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement in
positioning frequency layer *i*:

$T_{effect,i} = \ \left\lceil \frac{T_{i}}{T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}} \right\rceil*T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$

where

$T_{i}$ corresponds to *durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsInEveryTms* in TS
37.355 \[34\],

$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}} = \ \text{LCM}\left( T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}},\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}} \right)$,

${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$

Note: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
fully or partially covered by the MG are considered.

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 \[TS 23.273\], the
time $T_{UERxTx,Total}$ starts from the first MG instance aligned with
DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 \[TS 23.273\], the time$\ T_{UERxTx,Total}$ starts
from the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in the
assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 \[TS 23.273\], the UE shall perform the PRS-RSRP measurement in
each reporting period and activate the location report at the time when
the periodic timer expires.

Note: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted if HO
occurs during the measurement period and after SRS reconfiguration on
the target cell is complete.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

\- if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

\- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured either per UE request or not per
UE request, the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in this section apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period T~UERxTx,Total~ within measurement
gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a longer
measurement period may be used.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

The requirements in clause 9.9.4 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured,
subject to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

When PSCell or SCell addition or release does not cause SRS
reconfiguration during the measurement period, UE continues the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement, and the measurement period requirements
apply.

When PSCell or SCell addition or release causes SRS reconfiguration
during the measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement after the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell
is complete.

When SRS is reconfigured without serving cell change during the
measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement after the SRS reconfiguration is complete.If UE uplink
transmission timing changes due to the network-configured Timing Advance
command during the UE Rx-Tx measurement period, then the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement period is restarted after uplink transmission
timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period
requirements in this clause shall not apply.

When a serving cell change occurs during the measurement period, the UE
shall continue and complete the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
provided that the serving cell change does not impact SRS configuration
for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in Table 7.1.2-2 during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is
restarted after uplink transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1.2 during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, then:

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement period requirements in this clause shall apply
for a cell, which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in
section 7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply for a cell, which is not the downlink reference cell (defined in
section 7.1.1) for SRS transmission. The UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period may be restarted in such case.

#### 9.9.4.6 Measurement Period Requirements without Measurement Gaps

When physical layer receives last of
*NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF via LPP
\[34\], UE shall be able to measure multiple* (up to the UE capability

within the measurement period $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,Total}$ ms.

$T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap\text{,\ Total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$,

positioning frequency layer, and a positioning frequency layer is in
Case 2 if UE reports *ppw-durationOfPRS-Processing2-r17* for the band
containing the positioning frequency layer.

$T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap\text{,i}}$ is the measurement period for UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement in positioning frequency layer *i* as
specified below.

$T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i} = {\left( k_{\text{multiTEG},i}*N_{\text{RxBeam},i}*\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last},i}$

same DL PRS resource simultaneously from multiple Rx TEGs, and

$k_{\text{multiTEG},i\ }$=$\left\lceil \frac{N_{TEG,i}}{k_{TEG,simul,i}} \right\rceil$
if UE is capable of receiving the same DL PRS resource simultaneously
from multiple Rx TEGs.

where

$N_{TEG,i}$ is the number of Rx TEGs or RxTx TEGs with which UE is
requested to measure a PRS resource indicated via
*measureSameDL-PRS-ResourceWithDifferentRxTEGs-r17* or
*measureSameDL-PRS-ResourceWithDifferentRxTxTEGs-r17* \[34\] in
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation*, and in case 'n0' is
indicated, $N_{TEG,i}$ is the maximum number of Rx TEGs with which UE
can support to measure the same PRS resource as reported in
*NR-UE-TEG-Capability*, and

$k_{TEG,simul,i}$ is the number of Rx TEGs UE can measure simultaneously
which is reported via
*measureSameDL-PRS-ResourceWithDifferentRxTEGsSimul*.

$N_{RxBeam,i}\ $is the scaling factor for Rx beam sweeping, and

positioning frequency layer *i* is in FR2,$\ N_{RxBeam,i}$ is equal to
the value reported by the UE in *supportedLowerRxBeamSweepingFactor-FR2*
if the UE supports the capability for the band containing positioning
frequency layer i, and the LMF indicates *lowerRxBeamSweepingFactor-FR2*
in *NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation*. $N_{RxBeam,i}$ **is**
equal to 8, otherwise.

$L_{\text{available}\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS
resources in the positioning frequency layer *i*, to be measured during
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$, and is calculated in the same way
as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\]. *For
calculation of* $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$*,*

*only the unmuted PRS resources that meet the applicability conditions
and fully or partially overlapped with PRS processing window are
considered*, if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1, or*

only the PRS resources unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with
the first (PPWL-T2) ms of PPW are considered, if *positioning frequency
layer i is in Case 2,* *where PPWL is the PPW length* *and T2
corresponds to ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2.*

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 1 if the UE is capable of
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* defined in \[34\] and
LMF requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced
number of samples by *reducedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* \[34\] and the
following conditions are met:

\- PRS bandwidth is within the active BWP and

\- Magnitude of difference between the serving cell's SS-RSRP and the
neighbor cell's PRS-RSRP is within 6 dB.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 2 if the UE is capable of
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* defined in \[34\] and
the LMF requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced
number of samples by *reducedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* \[34\] but the
following conditions are not met:

\- PRS bandwidth is within the active BWP and

\- Magnitude of difference between the serving cell's SS-RSRP and the
neighbor cell's PRS-RSRP is within 6 dB.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 4 otherwise.

\- $\text{T}_{\text{last,i}}$ is the measurement duration for the last
UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement sample in the positioning layer i,
including the sampling time and processing time.

If *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1 and* all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = $T_{\text{i}}$ +PPWL,
else

if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2 and* all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = PPWL;

otherwise, $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ **=** $T_{\text{i}}$ **+**
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$**.**

\- $T_{effect,i}$ is periodicity of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
in positioning frequency layer *i*:

$T_{effect,i} = \ \left\lceil \frac{T_{i}}{T_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}} \right\rceil*T_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}$

where

$T_{i}$ corresponds to ***ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT*** in TS
37.355 \[34\] if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or
corresponds to the sum of *ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2* and

$\text{PPWRP}_{\text{i}}$

$\text{PPWRP}_{\text{i}}$ is the PRS processing window repetition
periodicity in positioning frequency layer *i*.

$T_{PRS,i}$ is the PRS resource periodicity in positioning frequency
layer *i*. If the positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL
PRS resource sets with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$

Note: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
that meet the applicability conditions and fully or partially covered by
the PRS processing window are considered.

The time $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ starts from the first PRS processing
window instance aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data
after both the *NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted if HO
occurs during the measurement period and after SRS reconfiguration on
the target cell is complete.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

\- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the PRS processing window is reconfigured or reactivated either
per UE request or not per UE request, the measurement period can be
longer.

The requirements in this section apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ within
PRS processing window due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a
longer measurement period may be used.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

The requirements in clause 9.9.4.6 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured,
subject to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

When PSCell or SCell addition or release does not cause SRS
reconfiguration during the measurement period, UE continues the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement, and the measurement period requirements
apply.

When PSCell or SCell addition or release causes SRS reconfiguration
during the measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement after the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell
is complete.

*W*hen SRS is reconfigured without cell change during the measurement
period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement after
the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell is complete.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the network-configured
Timing Advance command during the UE Rx-Tx measurement period, then the
UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted after uplink
transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period requirements in this clause shall not apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in Table 7.1.2-2 during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is
restarted after uplink transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1.2 during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, then:

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement period requirements in this clause shall apply
for a cell, which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in
section 7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply for a cell, which is not the downlink reference cell (defined in
section 7.1.1) for SRS transmission. The UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period may be restarted in such case.

If any *positioning frequency layer is in Case 2, the requirements in
this clause apply provided that the PPWL corresponding to the
positioning frequency layer is larger than (T2+X) ms.*

*The requirements in this clause apply provided that a single
positioning frequency layer is configured for measurement in each PPW.*

#### 9.9.4.7 Void

#### 9.9.4.8 Measurements Period Requirements with both MG and PPW

If the UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the UE shall measure positioning frequency layer
*i* within

\- MG, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with MG, or

\- PPW, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with PPW.

The measurement period $T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,\ Total}}$ is defined as:

$T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,\ Total}} = T_{UERxTx,Total,MG} + \ T_{UERxTx,Total,PPW}\  + \ T_{\text{guard}}$*,*

Where

*-* $T_{\text{UERxTx},Total,MG}$ is defined in clause 9.9.4.5 and
includes all positioning frequency layers to be measured within MG,

*-* $T_{\text{UERxTx},Total,PPW}$ is defined in clause 9.9.4.6 and
includes all positioning frequency layers to be measured within PPW,

\- $T_{\text{guard}}$ is the maximum T~effect~ defined in clauses
9.9.4.5 and 9.9.4.6 among all PFLs.

The requirements apply provided the following conditions are satisfied:

\- MGs and PPWs do not overlap in time;

\- Each PFL in the assistance data can be measured completely (all PRS
resources) either within MG or within activated PPW.

### 9.9.5 E-CID measurements

The requirements in clause 9.9.5 shall apply provided the UE has
received *nr-ECID-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP
\[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more of the following
measurements for NR E-CID positioning \[22\]: SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ,
CSI-RSRP, and CSI-RSRQ.

#### 9.9.5.2 Measurement Requirements

##### 9.9.5.2.1 Intra-frequency Measurement Requirements

The intra-frequency NR E-CID measurements shall meet the requirements in
clause 9.2 and clause 9.10.2, except the measurement reporting
requirements. The NR E-CID measurement reporting requirements are
defined in clause 9.9.5.2.3.

The reported intra-frequency NR E-CID measurements shall also meet:

\- for FR1 SS-RSRP, the accuracy requirements in clauses 10.1.2.1,

##### 9.9.5.2.2 Inter-frequency Measurement Requirements

The inter-frequency NR E-CID measurements shall meet the requirements in
clause 9.3 and 9.10.4, except the measurement reporting requirements.

\- for FR2 CSI-RSRQ, the accuracy requirements 10.1.10.2.

##### 9.9.5.2.3 Measurement Reporting Delay

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the
moment when the periodic measurement report is triggered and the moment
when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface. This requirement assumes that that the measurement report is
not delayed by other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or
subslot when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with
subframe or slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay
excludes any delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the
measurement report.

The reported NR E-CID measurement values contained in periodically
triggered measurement reports shall be based on the measurement report
mapping requirements specified in clause 10.1.6 for SS-RSRP and
CSI-RSRP, and clause 10.1.11 for SS-RSRQ and CSI-RSRQ.

The UE shall not send any measurement reports as long as no
corresponding reporting criteria specified in clause 9.1.4 are
fulfilled.

### 9.9.6 PRS-RSRPP measurements

#### 9.9.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.9.6.5 shall apply when UE is performing PRS
measurement in the configured MG and provided the UE has received a
message from LMF via LPP requesting the UE to measure and report
PRS-RSRPP measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

The requirements in clause 9.9.6.6 shall apply when UE is performing PRS
measurement without gap and provided the UE has received a message from
LMF via LPP requesting the UE to measure and report PRS-RSRPP
measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

#### 9.9.6.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9.6 apply for periodic and triggered
PRS-RSRPP measurements, provided:

\- PRS-RSRPP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.38 are met for
a corresponding Band.

#### 9.9.6.3 Measurement capability

UE PRS-RSRPP measurement capability is as indicated by the UE in
*NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities* according to TS 37.355 \[34\].

#### 9.9.6.4 Measurement reporting requirements

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes the delay uncertainty caused by inserting the measurement
report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The reported PRS-RSRPP measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clauses 10.1.38.3.

The PRS-RSRPP measurement accuracy for all measured PRS resources shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy requriements specified in the
clauses 10.1.38.2.

#### 9.9.6.5 Measurement period requirements

For PRS measurement within MG configured to UE, measurement period
requirements for PRS-RSRP defined in 9.9.3.5 is re-used for PRS-RSRPP.

#### 9.9.6.6 Measurement Period Requirements without Measurement Gaps

For PRS measurement without MG configured to UE, measurement period
requirements for PRS-RSRP defined in 9.9.3.6 is re-used for PRS-RSRPP.

The PRS-RSRPP measurement requirements in this section apply for the
first path PRS-RSRP measurement.

#### 9.9.6.7 Void

#### 9.9.6.8 Measurements Period Requirements with both MG and PPW

If the UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the measurement period requirements for PRS-RSRP
defined in 9.9.3.8 is re-used for PRS-RSRPP.

9.10 CSI-RS based L3 measurements
---------------------------------

### 9.10.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the UE regarding CSI-RS
based measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements
are split in intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements
requirements.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided:

\- Only one MO is configured per CSI-RS frequency layer, and

\- all CSI-RS resources in the same MO are configured with the same
csi-rs-MeasurementBW, and

\- *associatedSSB* is configured in *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and
detectable, and

\- all CSI-RS resources in the same MO are configured with the same
periodicity, and- the associated SSB is QCLed with the corresponding
CSI-RS resources in FR2, and

\- the number of CSI-RS resources in any duration that equals to the
length of a slot is no larger than UE capability
*maxNumberCSI-RS-RRM-RS-SINR*.

\- When there are mixed numerologies, the length of a slot is defined
based on the smallest SCS

### 9.10.2 CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements

#### 9.10.2.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement
provided that:

\- the SCS of the CSI-RS resource of the neighbour cell configured for
measurement is the same as the SCS of the CSI-RS resource on the serving
cell indicated for measurement, and

\- the CP type of the CSI-RS resource of neighbour cell configured for
measurement is the same as the CP type of the CSI-RS resource of the
serving cell indicated for measurement, and

\- It is applied for SCS = 60KHz

\- the centre frequency of the CSI-RS resource of the neighbour cell
configured for measurement is the same as the centre frequency of the
CSI-RS resource of the serving cell indicated for measurement

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR measurements of identified
intra-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell or the PSCell.

No measurement gap is needed for intra-frequency CSI-RS resources
measurements.

For intra-frequency CSI-RS based measurements, UE may cause scheduling
restriction as specified in clause 9.10.2.6.

Note: Extended CP for CSI-RS based measurement is not supported in this
release.

#### 9.10.2.2 Requirements applicability

The measurement of the associated SSB follows the same requirements as
SSB based measurements defined in 9.2.

The requirements in clause 9.10.2 apply, provided:

\- Only one intra-frequency CSI-RS layer per serving cell is configured,
and

\- The BW of the CSI-RS on the intra-frequency neighbor cell is within
the active BWP of the UE, and

\- The associated SSB of the CSI-RS resources being identified or
measured are detectable, and the CSI-RS resources configured for CSI-RS
based L3 measurements are measurable, and

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS resources of intra-MO is the same as that of
the CSI-RS resources configured for the serving cell, and

\- All CSI-RS resources on one intra-frequency layer are configured
within up to two separate windows where each window is up to 5ms, and

\- for the case of single window further provided

\- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 10ms, 20ms or
40ms- for the case of two separate windows further provided

\- The two windows are either both fully non-overlapped with MG or both
partially overlapped with MG

> \- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 20ms or 40ms

\- The starting point of the first window is the slot boundary of the
serving cell, where the corresponding slot contains the configured L3
CSI-RS resource of the serving cell in the servingCellMO with the
smallest offset, and

> \- The starting point of the second window if configured is determined
> by an offset of half of the CSI-RS periodicity in slots with regards
> to the starting point of the first window, and

\- Numerology for intra-frequency CSI-RS and data of serving cell are
the same.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant associated SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2.1 and
10.1.3.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7.1 and
10.1.8.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12.1 and
10.1.13.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
Band.

A CSI-RS resource shall be considered measurable when for each relevant
CSI-RS resource:

\- CSI-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2.3 and
10.1.3.3 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- CSI-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7.2 and
10.1.8.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- CSI-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12.2 and
10.1.13.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- CSI\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.12 for a
corresponding Band.

#### 9.10.2.3 Number of cells and number of CSI-RS

##### 9.10.2.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 32 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI on the
intra-frequency layer, and

\- the cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB

##### 9.10.2.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For one single intra-frequency CSI-RS layer in a band, during each layer
1 measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP,
CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 32 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI, and

\- the cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB.

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC on which UE is configured to report CSI-RS measurement when UE is
configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the band; or

\- PSCC on which UE is configured to report CSI-RS measurement when UE
is configured with EN-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- One of the SCCs on which UE is configured to report CSI-RS based
measurements when neither PCC nor PSCC is in the same band, so that the
selected SCC shall be an SCC where the UE is configured with CSI-RSRP
measurement reporting if such SCC exists, otherwise the selected SCC is
determined by UE implementation.

The UE shall also be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least 2 CSI-RSs on serving cell for each of
the other intra-frequency layer(s) in the same band.

For each FR2 band, UE is only required to measure neighbour cell CSI-RS
on the CSI-RS layer, whose associated SSB is on the same SSB layer as
the one where UE is required to measure neighbour cell SSB.

#### 9.10.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

Note: The UE is not required to report CSI-RS based L3 measurements when
the timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is larger than one CP. If the UE reports
CSI-RS based L3 measurements when the timing offset exceeds one CP, the
UE is not required to meet the CSI-RS based L3 measurement accuracy
requirements for CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR in TS 38.133 section
10.1, which apply only when the timing offset is no larger than one CP.

##### 9.10.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.3, 10.1.7.2, 10.1.8.2, 10.1.12.2 and 10.1.13.2.

##### 9.10.2.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.3, 10.1.7.2, 10.1.8.2, 10.1.12.2 and
10.1.13.2.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.10.2.4.3.

##### 9.10.2.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI- SINR measurements contained in
event triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.3, 10.1.7.2, 10.1.8.2, 10.1.12.2 and 10.1.13.2.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criterion is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than the CSI-RS based measurement defined in
clause 9.10.2.5. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

#### 9.10.2.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameters
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and *associatedSSB*, the CSI-RS based
measurement shall include PSS/SSS detection time of associatedSSB, the
time period used to acquire the SFN information and CSI-RS based
measurement period without gap.

\- PSS/SSS detection time of associatedSSB is the intra-frequency
T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ in Clause 9.2.5.1.

\- The time period used to acquire the SFN information is equal to 0 if
the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is synchronous with the
serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled). Otherwise, the time
period used to acquire the SFN information is T~CSI-RS\_SFN\_intra~ as
shown in Table 9.10.2.5-3 for FR1. It is assumed that
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

\- If the associatedSSB, which has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.2.5.1,
becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the associatedSSB
becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ±
3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as defined in
clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\], PSS/SSS detection time and time period
used to acquire the SFN information are equal to 0.

The measurement period for CSI- RS based intra-frequency measurements
without gaps is as shown in table 9.10.2.5-1and Table 9.10.2.5-2.

Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SS/PBCH
block is configured but not detected by the UE, or if CSI-RS is
configured with associated SSB but not QCL-ed to the associated SSB, the
UE is not required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource.

#### 9.10.2.6 Scheduling availability of UE during CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements 

UE is required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when
CSI-RS resources are completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.
Note the configured CSI-RS symbol is indicated in
*firstOFDMSymbolInTimeDomain* included in
*CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility* for RRM. When UE is required to perform
CSI-RS based RRM measurements, and any of the conditions in the
following clauses is met, there are restrictions on the scheduling
availability; otherwise, there is no scheduling restriction. Note same
numerology for intra-frequency CSI-RS and data of serving cell is
considered in this release.

##### 9.10.2.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing CSI-RS based measurements in TDD bands

When UE performs CSI-RS intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band,

\- UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on configured CSI-RS
resource symbols, and on 1 OFDM symbol before and after each
consecutively configured CSI-RS symbols.

When TDD intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.10.2.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing CSI-RS based measurements in FR2 

When the UE performs CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements for L3
mobility management in FR2, the following restrictions apply.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on the configured CSI-RS symbol within
the configured slot as indicated in *slotConfig of the corresponding
CSI-RS resource to be measured for mobility.*

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to
CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ or CSI-SINR measurement on an FR2 intra-frequency
cell in different bands, provided that UE is capable of independent beam
management on this FR2 band pair.

### 9.10.3 CSI-RS based Inter-frequency measurements

#### 9.10.3.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.10.2.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and the higher layer parameter
*associatedSSB* is configured, the UE shall be able to identify
inter-frequency cells indicated for measurement and perform CSI-RSRP,
CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency cells.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect the
associated SSB nor perform measurement of the CSI-RS resource configured
in *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* on an inter-frequency measurement object
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, and
ends later than the gap end -- switching time. When the inter-frequency
cells are in FR2 and the per-FR gap is configured to the UE in EN-DC, SA
NR, NE-DC and NR-DC, or the serving cells are in FR2, the
inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-UE gap is configured to the
UE in SA NR and NR-DC, the switching time is 0.25ms. Otherwise the
switching time is 0.5ms.

If a UE is configured with multiple concurrent gaps, the requirements in
this clause shall apply when the measurement gap pattern is configured
to be associated to the CSI-RS resources of the inter-frequency layer.

#### 9.10.3.2 Requirements applicability

The associated SSB layer of the CSI-RS follows the same requirements as
SSB based measurements defined in 9.3.

The requirements in clause 9.10.3 apply, provided:

\- The associated SSB of the cell being identified or measured is
detectable, and

\- All CSI-RS resources on one inter-frequency layer are configured
within a window of up to 5ms, and

\- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 10ms, 20ms or
40ms, and

\- CSI-RS resources for measurements and the associated SSB for cell
identification are configured within measurement gap.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant associated SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4.1 and
10.1.5.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9.1 and
10.1.10.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14.1 and
10.1.15.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
Band.

A CSI-RS resource shall be considered measurable when for each relevant
CSI-RS resource:

\- CSI-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4.3 and
10.1.5.3 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- CSI-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9.2 and
10.1.10.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- CSI-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,

\- CSI \_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.13 for a
corresponding Band.

#### 9.10.3.3 Number of cells and number of CSI-RS resources

##### 9.10.3.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 14 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI , and

\- The cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB.

##### 9.10.3.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For each inter-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 24 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI, and

\- The cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer the associated SSB.

#### 9.10.3.4 Measurements reporting requirements

Note: The UE is not required to report CSI-RS based L3 measurements when
the timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is larger than one CP. If the UE reports
CSI-RS based L3 measurements when the timing offset exceeds one CP, the
UE is not required to meet the CSI-RS based L3 measurement accuracy
requirements for CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR in TS 38.133 section
10.1, which apply only when the timing offset is no larger than one CP.

##### 9.10.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.2, 10.1.5.2, 10.1.9.2, 10.1.10.2, 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2..

##### 9.10.3.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.2, 10.1.5.2, 10.1.9.2, 10.1.10.2, 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2..

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.10.3.4.3.

##### 9.10.3.4.3 Event-triggered Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.2, 10.1.5.2, 10.1.9.2, 10.1.10.2, 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2..

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 × TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be within CSI-RS based measurement defined in clause .
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

#### 9.10.3.5 Inter frequency measurements with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, if configured with the higher layer
parameters *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and *associatedSSB,* the UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable CSI-RS based inter frequency cell
within T ~CSI-RS\_identify\_inter~,

T ~CSI-RS\_identify\_inter~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync~ + T
~CSI-RS\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~CSI-RS\_SFN\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync~ is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection which is
determined according to T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ in clause 9.3.4,

~TCSI-RS\_SFN\_inter\ is\ the\ time\ period\ used\ to\ acquire\ the\ SFN\ information\ of\ the\ cell\ being\ measured,\ which\ is\ shown\ in\ Table\ 9.10.3.5-3\ for\ FR1\ and\ equals\ inter-frequency\ TSSB\_time\_index\_inter\ in\ Clause\ 9.3.4\ for\ FR2,~

T~CSI-RS\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of
CSI-RS based measurement given in table 9.10.3.5-1 and table
9.10.3.5-2..

M~meas\_period\_inter~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or 5,
M~meas\_period\_inter~ =8×N samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power class
2, M~meas\_period\_inter~=5×N samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 3, M~meas\_period\_inter~ =5×N samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 4, M~meas\_period\_inter~ = 5×N samples. Note that scaling
factor N = \[8\].

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

If a UE which supports concurrent measurement gaps has been configured
with concurrent measurement gaps, K~p\_CSI-RS~ is the scaling factor for
a CSI-RS frequency layer to be measured within the associated
measurement gap which is defined as K~p\_CSI-RS~ = N~total~ /
N~available~. K~p\_CSI-RS~ = 1 for for UE not configured with concurrent
measurement gaps.

\- For a window W of duration max(CSI-RS period,
MGRP\_max)[,]{.underline} where MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all
configured per-UE MG and per-FR MG within the same FR as the CSI-RS
frequency layer, and starting at the beginning of any gap occasions
covering the CSI-RS resources.:

\- N~total~ is the total number of associated gap occasions covering
CSI-RS resources within the window, **including both** dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within the
window, and

\- N~available~ is the number of **non-dropped** associated gap
occasions covering CSI-RS resources within the window W, after
accounting for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision
rule.

\- Requirements do not apply if N~available~ = 0

Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SSB is
configured but not detected by the UE, or if CSI-RS configured with
associated SSB but not QCL-ed to the associated SSB, the UE is not
required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource.

9.11 NR measurements with autonomous gaps
-----------------------------------------

### 9.11.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are applicable for CGI identification of
an intra frequency and inter frequency NR target cell.

The requirements in this clause are specified for CGI identification of
an NR target cell and are applicable for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured with SA or NR-DC or NE-DC operation mode, or with EN-DC
operation mode for CGI identification requested by NR PSCell.

The overall CGI reporting delay is defined in clause 9.11.3.

### 9.11.2 CGI identification of an NR cell with autonomous gaps

The UE shall identify and report the CGI of a known NR target cell when
requested by the network for the purpose of reportCGI. Only one cell is
provided to the UE with *cellForWhichToReportCGI* for identifying the
CGI.The UE may make autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and
uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to
clause 5.5.3 of TS 38.331 \[2\]. Note that a UE is not required to use
autonomous gap if *useAutonomousGaps* is set to false. If autonomous
gaps are used for measurement with the purpose of reportCGI, regardless
of whether DRX is used or not, or whether SCell(s) are configured or
not, the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of NR cell within:

T~identify\_CGI~ = (T~MIB~ + T ~SIB1~) ms

Where:

T~MIB~ is the time period used to acquire MIB message. T~MIB~ = 6 \*
T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on FR1 and T~MIB~ = 25 \*
T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on FR2.

T~SIB1~ is the time period used to acquire SIB1 message. T~SIB1~ = 6 \*
T~RMSI-scheduling~ ms.

Where T~SMTC~ is the SMTC periodicity configured for the target cell
measurement, and T~RMSI-scheduling~ is

\- the maximum between the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually
transmitted by the NR target cell and 20ms when SSB and RMSI CORESET
multiplexing pattern is 1

\- the maximum between the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually
transmitted by the NR target cell and T~SMTC~ when SSB and RMSI CORESET
multiplexing pattern is 2 or 3.

The requirement for identifying the CGI of an NR cell within
T~identify\_CGI~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well as when any
of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

Within the time T~identify\_CGI~, over which the UE identifies the CGI
of an NR cell, the UE shall fulfil interruption requirements specified
in,

\- Clause 8.2.1.2.16 for NR serving cells and Clause 7.32.2.15 in
TS36.133 \[15\] for E-UTRA serving cells if the UE is configured with
EN-DC operation mode,

\- Clause 8.2.2.2.14 if the UE is configured with SA operation mode,

\- Clause 8.2.3.2.14 for NR serving cells and Clause 7.36.2.14 in
TS36.133 \[15\] for E-UTRA serving cells if the UE is configured with
NE-DC operation mode,

\- Clause 8.2.4.2.11 if the UE is configured with NR-DC operation mode.

In the requirement a cell is known if,

\- During the last 5 seconds for FR1 or 3 seconds for FR2 before the
reception of the report CGI command:

\- The UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index for
the target cell and

\- During MIB decoding at least reported SSBs remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2
or 9.3 of TS 38.133, and

\- During SIB1 decoding the SSB used for MIB decoding remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2
or 9.3 of TS 38.133, and

\- During MIB decoding, the SSB for MIB decoding remains detectable with
SNR ≥-3dB

\- During SIB1 decoding, the PDSCH for SIB1 decoding remains detectable
with SNR ≥-3dB

### 9.11.3 CGI reporting delay

The CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command that
will trigger a CGI report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than T~identify\_CGI~ defined in
clause 9.11.2 plus RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\], and additional 20ms margin if target cell is on FR2.

9.11A NR measurements with autonomous gaps for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------------

### 9.11A.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are applicable for CGI identification of
an intra frequency and inter frequency NR target cell.

The requirements in this clause are specified for CGI identification of
an NR target cell and are applicable for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured with SA operation mode.

The overall CGI reporting delay is defined in clause 9.11A.3.

### 9.11A.2 CGI identification of an NR cell with autonomous gaps 

The UE shall identify and report the CGI of a known NR target cell when
requested by the network for the purpose of reportCGI. Only one cell is
provided to the UE with *cellForWhichToReportCGI* for identifying the
CGI.The UE may make autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and
uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to
clause 5.5.3 of TS 38.331 \[2\]. Note that a UE is not required to use
autonomous gap if *useAutonomousGaps* is set to false. If autonomous
gaps are used for measurement with the purpose of reportCGI, regardless
of whether DRX is used or not, the UE shall be able to identify a new
CGI of NR cell within:

T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~ = (T~MIB\_redcap~ + T ~SIB1\_redcap~) ms

Where:

> For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

T~MIB\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire MIB message.
T~MIB\_redcap~ = 6 \* T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on
FR1 and T~MIB\_redcap~ = 25 \* T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier
frequency on FR2.

T~SIB1\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire SIB1 message.
T~SIB1\_redcap~ = 6 \* T~RMSI-scheduling~ ms.

> For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

T~MIB\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire MIB message.
T~MIB\_redcap~ = 6 \* T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on
FR1.

T~SIB1\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire SIB1 message.
T~SIB1\_redcap~ = 12 \* T~RMSI-scheduling~ ms.

Where T~SMTC~ is the SMTC periodicity configured for the target cell
measurement, and T~RMSI-scheduling~ is

\- the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually transmitted by the NR
target cell when SSB and RMSI CORESET multiplexing pattern is 1

\- the maximum between the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually
transmitted by the NR target cell and T~SMTC~ when SSB and RMSI CORESET
multiplexing pattern is 2 or 3.

The requirement for identifying the CGI of an NR cell within
T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well as
when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

Within the time T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~, over which the UE identifies
the CGI of an NR cell, the UE shall fulfil interruption requirements
specified in,

\- Clause 9.11A.4 if the UE is configured with SA operation mode.

In the requirement a cell is known if,

\- During the last 5 seconds for FR1 or 3 seconds for FR2 before the
reception of the report CGI command:

\- The UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index for
the target cell and

\- During MIB decoding at least reported SSBs remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses
9.2B or 9.3B of TS 38.133, and

\- During SIB1 decoding the SSB used for MIB decoding remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses
9.2B or 9.3B of TS 38.133, and

\- During MIB decoding, the SSB for MIB decoding remains detectable with
SNR ≥-3dB

\- During SIB1 decoding, the PDSCH for SIB1 decoding remains detectable
with SNR ≥-3dB

### 9.11A.3 CGI reporting delay

The CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command that
will trigger a CGI report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~
defined in clause 9.11A.2 plus RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12
in TS 38.331 \[2\], and additional 20ms margin if target cell is on FR2.

### 9.11A.4 CGI reporting scheduling restriction

When a RedCap UE is identifying CGI of an NR cell with autonomous gaps,
the UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on PCell for the following slots:

\- with up to K1 interruptions with interrupted slots up to X1 specified
in Table 9.11A.4-1 for each interruption during MIB decoding time period

RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2 and 3.

Where:

\- K1 = 6 for the target cell carrier frequency on FR1 and K1 = 25 for
the target cell carrier frequency on FR2, and

\- L1 = T~SIB1\_redcap~ /20 and

\- L2 = T~SIB1\_redcap~ /T~SMTC~, where T~SMTC~ is the periodicity of
the SMTC occasion configured for the target cell carrier.

difference measurement based on TRS, the requirements apply provided
that the SCS of the TRS is same as that of the active BWP on PCell.

For FR2, the requirements apply if QCL information is provided for all
the TRS resources in the resource set and for each resource one RS has
QCL-TypeD.

If TRS resources overlap with Type 1A/1B/2 PPW, the UE is allowed longer
measurement period to measure UE Rx-Tx time difference on PCell.

### 9.12.5 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall report UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement results if UE
supports *gNB-SideRTT-BasedPDC-r17*.

The measurement reporting delay excludes the delay uncertainty caused by
inserting the measurement report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The
delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTIDCCH where TTIDCCH is the duration of
subframe or slot or subslot when the measurement report is transmitted
on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or subslot duration. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by no UL resources for UE to
send the measurement report.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement values contained in measurement
report shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25.3, with k = 5.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy shall be fulfilled
according to the accuracy requirements specified in clause 10.1.39.2 and
10.1.39.3 for PRS and TRS, respectively.

### 9.12.6 Scheduling availability during measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation

During measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation in an FR2 cell,

\- For the case where the PRS or TRS for PDC measurement is QCLed with
active TCI state for PDCCH/PDSCH, there are no scheduling restrictions
due to PDC measurement performed based on PRS or TRS.

\- Otherwise, the UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or
receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols
corresponding to the PRS or TRS resource configured for PDC measurement.

### 9.12.7 Measurement restriction for measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation

During measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation in an FR2 cell,
when the PRS or TRS for PDC measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB or CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both PRS or TRS for PDC measurement and the other RS if they
are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL information is not known to
UE. Longer measurement period for PRS or TRS for PDC measurement is
expected.

9.13 L1-RSRP measurements for a cell with different PCI from serving cell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.13.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured measurement resources from a cell with
different PCI in addition to serving cell (PCI indicated in
*additionalPCI-r17*), with the measurement resources configured as SSBs
of the cell with different PCI.

The UE shall be able to measure all SSB resources of the cell with
different PCI in *csi-SSB-ResourceSet* within the CSI-Resource*Config*
settings for the active BWP, while the *additionalPCI-r17 of the SSB
resources are different from serving cell PCI.* The number of resources,
including the number of resources configured for serving cell L1-RSRP
measurement in 9.5, does not exceed the UE capability indicated by
*beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the higher
layer parameter *reportConfigType* of each reporting setting
*CSI-ReportConfig* for the active BWP.

### 9.13.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in the clause 9.13 are applicable to inter-cell beam
management and inter-cell multi-TRP scenarios.

The requirements in clause 9.13 apply, provided the SSB from cell with
PCI different from serving cell configured for L1-RSRP if the following
conditions are met:

\- the number of cells with PCI different from seving cells N~max~ = 1
for FR2 and N~max~ = maxNrofAdditionalPCI for FR1. Where,
maxNrofAdditionalPCI is defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

> \- The SSB from the cell with different PCI completely contained in
> the active BWP or associated with initial downlink BWP of the UE
>
> \- The SSB of the cell with different PCI from serving cell has the
> same SCS, SFN offset and center frequency as the SSB of the serving
> cell

\- The timing difference of arrival at UE between the SSBs of serving
cell and cell with different PCI is less than CP length of the
corresponding SCS

\- The cell with different PCI from serving cell is known

\- The SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements are measurable

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP for cell with different PCI from
serving cell shall be considered measurable when for each relevant SSB
the following conditions are met:

10.1.20.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

The cell with different PCI from serving cell is considered as known if
the following conditions are met in this requirement:

\- The UE has sent a valid L3 measurement report during the last 5
seconds, and

\- The SSB from the cell with different PCI remains detectable according
to the cell identification requirements specified in clause 9.2.

Otherwise, the cell is unknown.

In case the SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements outside
SMTCs are overlapped with PDSCH/PDCCH that is associated to serving
cell, L1-RSRP measurement performance degradation is expected.

### 9.13.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2 if *nrofReportedRS* is configured to one. If
*nrofReportedRS* is configured to be larger than one, or if
*groupBasedBeamReporting-r17* is enabled, the UE shall use differential
L1-RSRP based reporting as defined in clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and 10.1.20
for FR2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2dB
step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in 10.1.6.

In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

#### 9.13.3.1 Periodic Reporting 

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1 and
10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send periodic L1-RSRP measurement reports for an
active BWP.

The UE shall transmit the periodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUCCH over the
air interface according to the periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in
TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.13.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting 

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in a Semi-Persistent L1-RSRP
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.13.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting 

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement report if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.13.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.13.4.1 Inter-cell SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

9.13.2, the UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based
on the configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CDP~. The

for FR2 when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- N= 8.

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{\text{MRGP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\-
P~2~=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB\_CDP~ \< T~SMTCperiod~)
and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB\_CDP~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P~2~
is$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with GAP and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB\_CDP~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with GAP and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and
T~SSB\_CDP~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P~2~=
$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{{min(T}_{\text{SMTCperiod}},MGRP)}}$,when
SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SSB\_CDP~ \<MGRP)
and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB\_CDP~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\- If SSB resource from serving cell is configured for L1-RSRP
measurements, and P~1~ is valid accoding to 9.5.4.1, and any symbol of
the SSBs from serving cell and cell with different PCI are overlapping
or adjacent (in time domain)

\- P =
$\frac{P_{2}}{1 - \frac{P_{2}*T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{{P_{1}*T}_{SSB\_ SC}}}$ ,
if P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~ \< P~1~\*T~SSB\_SC~.

\- P = P~2~, if P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~\> P~1~\*T~SSB\_SC~.

\- P = 2\*P~2~, if P~1~\*T~SSB\_SC~ = P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~.

\- Otherwise, P = P~2~

\- T~SSB\_CDP~ = SSB periodicity of the cell with PCI different from
serving cell

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period

\- T~SSB\_SC~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell of the serving cell

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 2, if SSB resource from serving cell is configured
for L1-RSRP measurements, and P~sharing\_factor~ is used in 9.5.4.1, and
any symbol of the SSBs from serving cell and cell with different PCI are
overlapping or adjacent (in time domain). P~L1\_sharing~ = 1, otherwise.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell with PCI different from serving cell,
longer evaluation period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell with PCI different from serving cell,
longer L1 RSRP measurement period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

### 9.13.5 Measurement restriction for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for L1-RSRP without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

Unless explicitly stated, the SSB to be measured for L1-RSRP measurement
is transmitted from cell(s) with PCI different from serving cell(s).

#### 9.13.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1,

> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as SSB
> transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
> measurement,
>
> \- UE shall be able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without
> any restriction;
>
> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
> CSI-RS transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
> measurement,
>
> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the
> SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;
>
> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,
>
> \- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
> able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any
> restriction;
>
> \- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
> is required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement
> and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP
> measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2,

> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
> symbol as SSB transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD, or CBD
> measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is
> required to measure one of but not both the two SSBs. Longer
> measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and
> no requirements are defined.
>
> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
> symbol as SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on the different CCs in the same
> band, UE is required to measure one of but not both the two SSBs.
> Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
> expected, and no requirements are defined.
>
> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
> symbol as CSI-RS transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD, CBD or
> L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,
> UE is required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP
> measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based
> L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

### 9.13.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions described in the following clauses
apply when UE is performing L1-RSRP measurement on cell(s) with PCI
different from serving cell, and UE is receiving PDCCH/PDSCH from
serving cell and/or cell(s) with different PCI.

#### 9.13.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement with the same SCS as
PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.13.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
> PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols
> corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions apply to cell(s) in the same band on the symbols that fully
or partially overlap with restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier
aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 cells configured in other bands than the bands in
which the cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed is configured.

#### 9.13.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
> PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols
> corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions is performed apply to cell(s) in the band on the symbols
that fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 cells in the bands due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s) in different band(s), provided that
UE is capable of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.
Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is configured
with different numerology between SSB on one FR2 band and data on the
other FR2 band provided the UE is configured for IBM operation for the
band pair.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

#### 9.13.6.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR1 cell(s).

#### 9.13.6.5 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs L1-RSRP measurement on cell with different PCI from
serving cell in a TDD band, the following restrictions apply due to
L1-RSRP measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on symbols
corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement,
where the transmission of PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS may be on serving cell(s) and
cell(s) with PCI different from serving cell(s), and restricted symbols
may partially or fully overlap with UL symbols
