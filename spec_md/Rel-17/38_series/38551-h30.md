 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies details of conformance testing of UE
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Over-the-Air (OTA) requirements

=========

Editor\'s Note: Intended to capture additional general information to be
used within this test specification, such as follows:

4.3 Specification suffix information

4.4 Test point analysis

4.5 Applicability and test coverage rules

4.6 Pass fail decisions rule of test case based on Test Tolerance
definitions.

4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Minimum Requirements given in 3GPP TS 38.151 \[7\] make no allowance
for Measurement Uncertainty (MU). The present document defines the MU
and Test Tolerances in Annex B for FR1 MIMO OTA. The test tolerances are
used to relax the Minimum Requirements in 3GPP TS 38.151 \[7\] to create
the Test Requirements.

4.2 Applicability of minimum requirements
-----------------------------------------

The MIMO OTA minimum requirements apply only to the primary mechanical
mode of UE which is declared by the manufacturer if the UE can support
multiple mechanical modes.

The minimum requirements apply only to the UE under normal environmental
conditions specified in Annex E.

4.3 Applicability rules for testing of SA and NSA UEs
-----------------------------------------------------

The applicability and test coverage rules for Non-Standalone (NSA) only
capable UEs shall include the following:

\- For FR1 NSA (EN-DC) only capable UEs, testing is not required.

The applicability and test coverage rules for Standalone (SA) and NSA
(EN-DC) capable UEs shall include the following:

\- For FR1 UEs, for each NR band in a device, test the UE in Standalone
Mode as per the TRMS test procedures in this specification. This shall
also fulfil coverage for all EN-DC minimum performance requirements for
that NR band and need not be retested in EN-DC mode.

5 Frequency Bands
=================

5.1 General
-----------

NR MIMO OTA Requirements are defined separately for different Frequency
Ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in which NR can operate according to
this version of the specification are identified as described in Table
5.1-1.

Table 5.1-1: Definition of frequency ranges

  Frequency range designation   Corresponding frequency range
  ----------------------------- -------------------------------
  FR1                           410 MHz - 7125 MHz
  FR2                           24250 MHz - 52600 MHz

The present specification covers FR1 operating bands.

5.2 Operating bands
-------------------

NR is designed to operate in FR1 operating bands defined in 3GPP TS
38.101-1 \[3\]. NSA band combinations are defined in 3GPP TS 38.101-3
\[3\].

6 FR1 MIMO OTA Performance
==========================

6.1 General
-----------

### 6.1.1 Definition of MIMO throughput

The MIMO throughput is defined here as the time-averaged number of
correctly received transport blocks in a communication system running an
application, where a Transport Block is defined in the reference
measurement channel. From OTA perspective, this is also called MIMO OTA
throughput. It will be used as the baseline figure of merit for FR1 and
FR2 MIMO OTA testing.

The MIMO OTA throughput is measured at the top of physical layer of NR
system under the use of FRC, the SS transmit fixed-size payload bits to
the DUT. The DUT signals back either ACK or NACK to the SS. The SS then
records the following:

\- number of ACKs;

\- number of NACKs; and

\- number of DTX slots.

Hence the MIMO (OTA) throughput can be calculated as:

![](./media/image3.wmf){width="3.5416666666666665in"
height="0.3819444444444444in"}

Where Transmitted TBS is the Transport Block Size transmitted by the SS,
which is fixed for an FRC during the measurement period. Measurement
Time is the total composed of successful slots (ACK), unsuccessful slots
(NACK) and DTX-symbols.

The time-averaging is to be taken over a time period sufficiently long
to average out the variations due to the fading channel. Therefore, this
is also called the average MIMO OTA throughput. The throughput should be
measured at a time when eventual start-up transients in the system have
evanesced.

### 6.1.2 Total Radiated Multi-Antenna Sensitivity (TRMS)

Editor's note: The test case is incomplete. TT is pending further
analysis.

##### 6.1.2.1 Test Purpose {#test-purpose .H6}

The purpose of this test is to ensure that the UE meets the TRMS minimum
performance requirements.

##### 6.1.2.2 Test Applicability {#test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 17 and forward. See
clause 4.2 for additional applicability.

##### 6.1.2.3 Minimum Conformance Requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

Editor\'s Note: TRMS values for n28/n79 are pending in RAN4 spec
TS38.151.

The average TRMS of free space data mode portrait (FS DMP), free space
data mode landscape (FS DML), and free space data mode screen up (FS
DMSU), is defined as the FR1 MIMO OTA requirement. The averaging shall
be done in linear scale for the TRMS results at these DUT positions,
according to the formula:

where

Such that *MODE* is one of {*FS\_DMP, FS\_DML, FS\_DMSU*}, and
{*P~MODE,70,0~, ..., P~MODE,70,11~*} are the measured sensitivity values
at each azimuth position at the 70% throughput outage.

The reported TRMS value shall be corrected by
$- 0.5 \cdot output\ \text{level}\ \text{step}\ \text{resolution}$ of
the final power step search and the correction shall be noted in the
test report.

If 1 azimuth position does not result in a defined measured sensitivity
at 70 % throughput, S~MODE,70~ is calculated using the 11 measured
sensitivities and the maximum downlink RS-EPRE P~RS-EPRE-MAX~
(substitution approach) for the one missing result. P~RS-EPRE-MAX~ is
the maximum downlink RS-EPRE supported by the test system, and is
defined as -80 dBm/15 kHz (or equivalent -77 dBm/30 kHz) for FR1 MIMO
OTA.

The TRMS shall be measured at the mid channel as specified in 3GPP TS
38.508-1 \[4\], subclause 4.3.1.The average TRMS shall be lower than the
average TRMS requirements specified in Table 6.1.2.3-1.

The additional criterion in azimuthal orientations shall be met:

\- The EUT has to meet 70 % throughput in 11 of total 12 azimuthal
orientations. If the EUT fails to meet this criterion even under maximum
downlink power condition (i.e. P~RS-EPRE-MAX~), the EUT shall fail the
FR1 MIMO OTA test.

\- The EUT has to meet 90 % throughput in 10 of total 12 azimuthal
orientations. If the EUT fails to meet this criterion even under maximum
downlink power condition (i.e. P~RS-EPRE-MAX~), the EUT shall fail the
FR1 MIMO OTA test.

FR1 TRMS minimum performance requirements for NR handheld UEs operating
in SA mode in free space and the primary mechanical mode for 70% DL
throughput with the corresponding measurement configurations
(i.e. channel model and gNB configuration) specified in clause C.1 and
clause E.1 are defined in Table 6.1.2.3-1.

##### 6.1.2.4 Test Description {#test-description .H6}

##### 6.1.2.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

A radio communications tester or a corresponding device is used as a gNB
simulator to setup calls to the DUT according to Clause D.1.

Channel model shall be set according to Clause C.1 and the emulated BS
beam configuration shall be set according to Clause C.2.

Chamber environment constraints shall be the same as described in Clause
A.2.1. The coordinate system shall match that of Clause A.3.

Environmental conditions from Annex E shall apply.

The positioning of the device under test within the test volume shall be
set as defined in Clause A.3.

The calibration procedure is specified in Clause A.2.2.

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE shall be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state for each test case.

1\) Ensure environmental requirements of Annex E are met.

2\) Configure the test system according to Annexes C and D for the
applicable test case.

3\) Verify the implementation of the channel model as specified in
clause C.3.

4\) Position the UE in the chamber according to clause A.3.

5\) Power on the UE.

6\) Set up the connection.

NOTE: For step 3, the verification of the channel model implementation
is usually performed once for each channel model as part of the
laboratory accreditation process and will remain valid as long as the
setup and instruments remain unchanged. Otherwise, the channel model
validation may need to be performed prior to starting each throughput
test.

##### 6.1.2.4.2 Test Procedure {#test-procedure .H6}

For throughput testing, the following steps shall be followed in order
to evaluate NR MIMO OTA performance of the DUT:

1\) Measure MIMO OTA throughput from one measurement point, the maximum
downlink power P~RS-EPRE-MAX~ is defined in clause 6.1.2. MIMO OTA
throughput is the minimum downlink signal power resulting in a
pre-defined throughput value, i.e. 70 % and 90 % of the maximum
theoretical throughput. The downlink signal power step size shall be no
more than 0.5 dB when RF power level is near the NR MIMO sensitivity
level.

2\) Rotate the UE around vertical axis of the test system by 30 degrees
and repeat from step 1 until one complete rotation has been measured
i.e. 12 different UE azimuth rotations.

3\) Repeat the test from step 1 for each specified device orientation. A
list of orientations is given in clause A.3.

4\) The postprocessing method to calculate the average MIMO Throughput
is defined in clause 6.

NOTE: For step 1 of throughput testing, the measurement is not needed to
start from maximum downlink power each time. To save testing time, the
starting downlink power can be set as a proper value (lower than maximum
downlink power supported by test system) as long as all the throughput
curve curves at 12 different UE azimuth rotations can reach at least 90%
of the maximum theoretical throughput.

##### 6.1.2.4 Test Requirements {#test-requirements .H6}

######## Annex A (normative): FR1 Test methodology

A.1 General
===========

FR1 MIMO OTA requirement testing is based on UE-noise limited
environmental condition, i.e. UE throughput characterized as a function
of signal power incident to the DUT antennas.

The minimum test zone size for FR1 MIMO OTA test methods is 20cm.
\"Black-box\" testing approach is adopted for NR MIMO OTA testing, the
geometric centre of the EUT shall be placed in the centre of the test
zone, the EUT shall be completely contained within the minimum test zone
size.

FR1 MIMO OTA requirement testing should be performed under primary
mechanical mode. The primary mechanical mode for devices having multiple
mechanical modes shall be declared by the manufacturers. Single primary
mechanical mode for each device should be declared for MIMO OTA
conformance testing.

A.2 Multi-Probe Anechoic Chamber (MPAC)
=======================================

A.2.1 System setup
------------------

MPAC test method is the reference methodology for FR NR MIMO OTA
testing. By arranging an array of antennas around the Equipment Under
Test (EUT), a spatial distribution of angles of arrival in MPAC system
may be simulated to expose the EUT to a near field environment that
appears to have originated from a complex multipath far field
environment.

As illustrated schematically in Figure A.2.1-1, signals propagate from
the base station/communication tester to the EUT through a simulated
multipath environment known as a spatial channel model, where
appropriate channel impairments such as Doppler and fading are applied
to each path prior to injecting all of the directional signals into the
chamber simultaneously through the antenna array. The resulting field
distribution in the test zone is then integrated by the EUT antenna(s)
and processed by the receiver(s) just as it would do so in any
non-simulated multipath environment. MPAC system with 16 uniformly
spaced dual-polarized probes is permitted for NR FR1 MIMO OTA testing.

height="2.075in"}

Figure A.2.1-1: MPAC system layout for NR FR1 MIMO OTA testing

For the selected environmental conditions modelled by the FR1 CDL
channel models, the minimum setup configuration can be described as in
Table A.2.1-1:

Table A.2.1-1: Example of a minimum setup for MPAC

                                        MPAC
  ------------------------------------- -------------------
  Minimum number of antenna positions   16
  Antenna spacing                       22.5
  Applicable channel model              FR1 UMi/UMa CDL-C

The setup of OTA chamber antennas with sixteen antenna positions is
depicted in Figure A.2.1-2. The DUT is at the centre, and the antennas
are aligned on a circle around the DUT with uniform spacing (e.g. 22.5°
with 32 elements arranged in 16 positions, where each position contains
a vertically and horizontally polarized antenna pair). Denoting
directions of *K* OTA antennas with *φ~k~*, *k* = 1... *K*, and antenna
spacing of 22.5°. Each antenna is connected to a single fading emulator
output port. In the figure, for example, antenna *A*~1V~ denotes the
first OTA antenna position and Vertically (V) polarized element, *A*~8H~
denotes the eight OTA antenna position and horizontally (H) polarized
element, etc.

dual polarized chamber antennas

The OTA/channel model coordinate systems and probe placement are further
clarified in Figure A.2.1-3. The *x*-axis of the coordinate system is
aligned with the centre of probe \#1 and the *x*, *y*, and *z* axes of
the OTA coordinate system are aligned with the *x~CM~*, *y~CM~*, and
*z~CM~* axes of the channel model coordinate system.

systems

A.2.2 Calibration procedure
---------------------------

The system needs to be calibrated by using a reference calibration
antenna with known gain values in order to ensure that the downlink
signal power is correct. In Non-Standalone (NSA) mode, the LTE link
antenna provides a stable LTE signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.

Unlike traditional TRP/TRS testing where the path loss corrections can
all be applied as a post processing step to the measured data, the path
loss for each probe in the MPAC system has to be balanced at test time
in order to generate the desired channel model environment within the
test zone of the chamber. The imbalance of each path during testing
would result in an alteration of the angular dependence of the channel
model (i.e. varied characteristics of generated channel model) within
the test zone of the chamber:

1\) Place a vertical reference dipole in the centre of the test zone,
connected to a VNA port, with the other VNA port connected to the input
of the channel emulator unit.

2\) Configure the channel emulator for bypass mode.

3\) Measure the response of each path from each vertical polarization
probe to the reference antenna in the centre of test zone.

4\) Adjust the power on all vertical polarization branches of the
channel emulator so that the powers received at the centre are equal.

5\) Repeat the steps 1 to 4 with the magnetic loop or horizontally
polarized reference dipole instead and adjust the horizontal
polarization branches of the channel emulator.

6\) The worst-case path loss becomes the reference path loss of the
entire system; this loss is used to compute the power in the centre of
the test zone relative to the output power of the Base Station
simulator. Besides, based on the reference path loss, the relative
offset of each path loss shall be corrected.

NOTE: Calibration based on other antennas, e.g. horn antennas is not
precluded.

This procedure shall be repeated on a regular basis, i.e., at least one
per year, and any time the conducted and/or radiated signal paths have
been affected, e.g., change in propagation conditions, replacement of
cables, change in measurement antennas/probes, etc. It is recommended to
perform this procedure rather frequently, e.g., monthly, to assess
system stability.

A.2.4 Minimum Range Length
--------------------------

The minimum range length of FR1 MPAC system is defined as the distance
from the centre of the test zone to the aperture of the measurement
probes/antennas, as illustrated in Figure A.2.4-1.

![A picture containing schematic Description automatically
generated](./media/image9.png){width="2.4833333333333334in"
height="2.4833333333333334in"}

Figure A.2.4-1: Illustration of range length definition of FR1 MPAC

The minimum range length for NR FR1 MPAC OTA systems with 20cm test zone
size is 1.2 m. While for MPAC systems, the far-field requirements do not
have to apply, it was shown that the spatial correlation can be impacted
significantly for distances below 1.2 m.

A.3 EUT positioning
===================

This Clause defines the measurement coordinate system for the NR MIMO
OTA.

1.  For FR1 MIMO OTA, the DUT shall be tested under Free Space Data Mode
    Portrait (FS DMP), Free Space Data Mode Landscape (FS DML), and Free
    Space Data Mode Screen Up (FS DMSU), the DUT azimuthal rotation
    shall be performed over 360 degrees per orientation in 30 degree
    steps (12 total positions). The three different test and environment
    conditions for handsets are summarized in Table A.3-1.

    The geometric centre of the DUT shall be aligned with the centre of
    the test zone/coordinate system and the DUT shall be fully contained
    within the test zone, i.e., a sphere with 20 cm diameter.

describe the relative angles between the two coordinate systems.

The following aspects are necessary:

\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed
in order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the
test, e.g., in the drawings used in this annex, the three buttons are on
the bottom of the device (front) and the camera is on the top of the
device (back).

\- An understanding of the origin and alignment the coordinate system
inside the test system i.e. the directions in which the *x*, *y*, *z*
-axes points inside the test chamber is needed in order to define
unambiguous DUT orientation, DUT beam, signal, interference, and
measurement angles

The detailed descriptions of each measurement uncertainty contributor
are defined in in clause B.2.

B.2 Measurement error contribution descriptions for MPAC
========================================================

B.2.1 Mismatch for measurement process
--------------------------------------

This term comes from the mismatch between the system input cables
connecting to the base station simulator output port. For more
information, see clause A.4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 38.561 \[8\].

B.2.2 Measurement distance uncertainty
--------------------------------------

The cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of
distance between the measurement antenna and the DUT. Given that 1.2 m
is defined as the minimum range length for FR1 MPAC system and the
device is not offset from the axis(es) of rotation, this term could be
set as 0 dB.

B.2.3 Quality of quiet zone
---------------------------

The quality of the quiet zone procedure characterizes the quiet zone
performance of the anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of
reflections within the anechoic chamber including any positioners and
support structures. For FR1 quality of quiet zone measurements,
reference antennas of sleeve dipole or magnetic loop are used. For more
information, see clauses A.3.7 and A.4.2.8 of 3GPP TS 38.561 \[8\] with
the exception that only the phi-axis ripple test is performed for MIMO
OTA.

The ripple test shall be repeated when the RF/propagation conditions
inside the chamber have changed, e.g., the chamber has been disassembled
and reassembled, portions of the absorber been replaced, measurement
antennas/probes been replaced, positioning system been replaced, etc.

B.2.4 Base Station simulator
----------------------------

gNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the channel emulator and then
to the device under test. Generally there occurs uncertainty
contribution from absolute level accuracy, non-linearity and frequency
characteristic of the gNB emulator.

For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as a calibration
equipment, gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration
measurement is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on the
absolute level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be assumed as
systematic. This uncertainty will be determined from the manufacturer\'s
datasheet and the distribution used shall match that provided in the
datasheet which are commonly quoting MUs/accuracies with a \"95 %
confidence level\" and/or a \"coverage factor of 2\". In the absence of
a declared distribution in the datasheet, the rectangular distribution
should be used. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is
included in the absolute level uncertainty.

B.2.5 Channel Emulator
----------------------

The channel emulator is also working as a signal source in the NR MIMO
OTA system, therefore there occurs uncertainty contribution from
absolute level accuracy, non-linearity, frequency characteristic and
stability of the channel emulator. These uncertainty contributions shall
be taken from the manufacturer\'s data sheet.

B.2.6 Amplifier uncertainties
-----------------------------

Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement
uncertainty. It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors
associated with the use of such components. For the case of external
amplifiers, the following uncertainties should be considered but the
applicability is contingent to the measurement implementation and
calibration procedure:

\- Stability:

\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of
the amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both
measurement and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall
be considered. This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by
the manufacturers\' data sheet for the operating conditions in which the
system will be required to operate.

\- Linearity:

\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier
since in most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two
different input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either
measured or determined by the manufacturers\' data sheet.

\- Noise Figure:

\- When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the
SNR at the output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the
input. This added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the
Error Rate of the receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An
uncertainty can be calculated through the following formula:

![](./media/image15.emf){width="2.0in" height="0.44166666666666665in"}

\- Where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used
during the sensitivity measurement.

\- Mismatch:

\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0dB. If it is not the case, the
mismatch uncertainty at its input and output shall be either measured or
determined by the method described in 3GPP TR 38.901 \[5\].

\- Gain:

\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0 dB. If it is not the case, this
uncertainty shall be considered.

B.2.7 Random uncertainty
------------------------

This contribution is used to account for all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with the measurements.

Random uncertainty MU contributions are normally distributed. The random
uncertainty term, by definition, cannot be measured, or even isolated
completely. A fixed value of 0.4 dB is suggested for TRMS measurements
to include a digital error rate uncertainty and is aligned with the
random uncertainty for TRS for NR FR1 (3GPP TS 38.561 \[8\]).

B.2.8 Throughput measurement: output level step resolution
----------------------------------------------------------

When output power of the communication tester is swept to reach the
throughput target that defines the sensitivity threshold, the final
power step resolution represents an asymmetric uncertainty contribution
that can be corrected since this uncertainty is device and test system
independent. The lab shall correct the TRMS results by
‑0,5 $\text{output\ level\ step\ resolution}$ of the final power step
search and note the correction in the test report. If the alternate DL
signal power search procedure with linearization, detailed in clause
A.2.3 is applied to assess the DL signal power at each grid point, no
correction of TRMS shall be applied and no additional MU shall be
considered.

B.2.9 Signal flatness
---------------------

For wireless technologies with wide channel bandwidths, the test system
might not have a flat frequency response across the entire channel.
While the range calibration corrects for any variation of frequency
response as a function of the centre frequency of the channel, the
broadband delivered to the test zone will be a function of the entire
channel bandwidth as opposed to just the centre frequency. For more
information, see clause A.4.2.14 of 3GPP TS 38.561 \[8\].

B.2.10 Mismatch for calibration process
---------------------------------------

During calibration stage, there will be impendence mismatch between the
various RF cables and components used within the system. Standing waves
are created by the reflections between any two components and
uncertainty in the signal level will be generated. In general, three
mismatch for calibration process should be considered:

\- Loopback cable path: This item comes from the mismatch between the
reference cable and the loopback cable during the loopback cable
measurement step.

\- System input path: This item comes from the mismatch between the
loopback cable and the system input cable (generally the output cable
after BS simulator). The reflectivity of the source output port is
measured at the end of the loopback cable connecting to the system input
cable.

\- Reference antenna: This item comes from the mismatch between the VNA
input port and the reference antenna. The reflectivity of the VNA input
port is measured at the end of the reference cable connecting to the
reference antenna.

For more information, see clause A.4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 38.561 \[8\].

B.2.11 Reference antenna positioning misalignment
-------------------------------------------------

This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and
pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain directions of
the reference antenna and the receiving antenna are aligned to each
other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

B.2.12 Total Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer
------------------------------------------------

This contribution originates from all uncertainties involved
transmission magnitude measurement (including drift and frequency
flatness) with a network analyser. will be determined from the
manufacturer\'s datasheet which is now commonly quoting MUs/accuracies
with a \"95 % confidence level\" and/or a \"coverage factor of 2\"and
the distribution used shall match that provided in the datasheet. In the
absence of a declared distribution in the datasheet, the rectangular
distribution should be used.

B.2.13 Uncertainty of an absolute gain of the calibration antenna
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The calibration antenna only appears in calibration phase (Stage 1).
Therefore, the gain uncertainty has to be taken into account.

This uncertainty shall come from a calibration report (which is now
commonly quoting MUs/accuracies with a \"95 % confidence level\" and/or
a \"coverage factor of 2\") with traceability to a National Metrology
Institute with measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the
guidelines outlined in internationally accepted standards. In the
absence of a declared distribution in the present document, the
rectangular distribution should be used.

B.2.14 Offset of the Phase Center of the Reference Antenna
----------------------------------------------------------

During range reference measurement, if a directional antenna is used,
the uncertainty in the accuracy of positioning its phase center on the
axis of rotation will directly generate an uncertainty in this part of
the measurement. In practical measurement, sleeve dipoles and loops are
used for FR1 calibration, then the uncertainty of this element should be
0 dB, since the phase center offset is negligible.

######## Annex C (normative): FR1 Channel models and Validation procedure

C.1 FR1 Channel models
======================

The following channel models are required for FR1 MIMO OTA measurement.

The generic models are Table C.1-1 FR1 UMi CDL-C and Table C.1-2 FR1 UMa
CDL-C, which do not include base station antenna filtering. UMi CDL-C
and UMa CDL-C are selected to define 2x2 and 4x4 MIMO OTA requirements,
respectively.

Therefore, in addition, the BS beam filtering effect defined in clause
C.2 also apply when emulating the channel models.

C.2 FR1 Base Station beam configuration
=======================================

The emulated BS beam configuration to be used for all emulation of
channel models defined in Annex C.1 is specified in this clause.

The Base Station beam configuration includes basic antenna parameters
and beamforming characteristic. The basic BS antenna parameters is
defined in Table C.2-1.

  Elements per panel in vertical dimension      *M~e~*   4                 8
  Elements per panel in horizontal dimension    *N~e~*   8                 8
  Number of polarizations per panel             *P*      2                 2
  Element spacing in horizontal dimension (λ)   *d~H~*   0.5               0.5
  Element spacing in vertical dimension (λ)     *d~V~*   0.5               0.5

Antenna element radiation patterns, including orientation of the element
main polarization components as well as orientation of the antenna array
are as in the example pattern in Table 7.3-1 of 3GPP TR 38.901 \[5\].
The antenna element has ±45° polarization components and the radiation
pattern parameters are θ~3dB~ = 65°, φ~3dB~ = 65°, A~max~ = 30dB, SLAv =
30dB, *G~E,max~* =8 dBi.

The beamforming characteristic of the FR1 BS pattern is defined as
follow:

\- A code book of 60 fixed beams is constructed to a grid of five
elevation angles from -20° to +20° with 10° steps and 12 azimuth angles
from -80° to +80° with \~15° steps.

\- For 4x4 MIMO OTA, two strongest transmitting beams are selected from
the pre-defined beam grid based on their proximity to the strong
clusters of each FR1 channel model. These beams should have different
azimuth directions and can provide the highest receive power for UE.

\- For 2x2 MIMO OTA, 1 strongest transmitting beam is selected from the
pre-defined beam grid which provides the highest received power for UE
based on the FR1 channel model.

\- Beam directions for channels model given in clause C.1 are:

\- For UMa CDL-C, the beam directions are:

\- Strongest beam: AoD: -7.27°, ZoD: 100°

\- 2^nd^ strongest beam: AoD: -21.82°, ZoD: 100°

\- For UMi CDL-C, the strongest beam direction is: AoD: -7.27°, ZoD:
100°.

C.3.2 Power Delay Profile (PDP)
-------------------------------

This measurement checks that the resulting power delay profile (PDP) is
in-line with the PDP defined for the channel model. For PDP validation
measurement, only Vertical validation is required.

The PDP measurement is performed with a Vector Network Analyser (VNA).
An example setup for PDP measurement is shown in Figure C.3.2-1. VNA
transmits frequency sweep signals thorough the NR MIMO OTA test system.
A reference antenna (i.e. dipole antenna), within the centre of the test
zone, receives the signal and VNA analyses the frequency response of the
system. A number of traces (frequency responses) are measured and
recorded by VNA and analysed by a post processing SW, e.g. Matlab.
Special care has to be taken into account to keep the fading conditions
unchanged, i.e. frozen, during the short period of time of a single
trace measurement. The fading may proceed only in between traces.

Figure C.3.2-1: Setup for PDP measurements

Step the emulation and store traces from VNA, i.e. run the emulation to
CIR number 1, pause, measure VNA trace, run the emulation to CIR number
10, pause, measure VNA trace. Continue until 1000 VNA traces are
measured.

VNA settings for PDP measurements are presented in Table C.3.2-1.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**

Measured VNA traces (frequency responses H(t,f)) are saved into a hard
drive. The data is read into, e.g. Matlab.\
The analysis is performed by taking the Fourier transform of each FR.
The resulting impulse responses h(t,τ) are averaged in power over time:

Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay, such that the first tap
is on delay zero.

**Beam-Specific Block Diagram**

It is assumed that the beams are mapped to the inputs of the channel
emulator as follows:

\- Beam 1: Input 1 and Input 2.

\- Beam 2: Input 3 and Input 4 (CDL-C UMa only).

C.3.3 Doppler/Temporal correlation
----------------------------------

This measurement checks the Doppler/temporal correlation. For
Doppler/Temporal correlation validation measurement, only Vertical
validation is required.

The Doppler spectrum is measured with a spectrum analyser as shown in
Figure C.3.3-1. In this case a signal generator transmits CW signal
through the NR MIMO OTA test system. The signal is received by a test
antenna within the test area. Finally, the signal is analysed by a
spectrum analyser and the measured spectrum is compared to the target
spectrum. This setup can be used to measure Doppler Spectrum of the
Channel models defined in clause C.1.

Figure C.3.3-1: Setup for Doppler measurements

Sine wave (CW, carrier wave) signal is transmitted from the signal
generator. The signal is connected from the signal generator to fading
emulator via cables. The fading emulator output signals are connected to
power amplifier boxes via cables. The amplified signals are then
transferred via cables to the probe antennas. The probe antennas radiate
the signals over the air to the test antenna. The Doppler spectrum is
measured by the spectrum analyser and the trace is saved.

Signal generator settings for Doppler/Temporal correlation measurements
are presented in Table C.3.3-1.

Method of measurement result analysis: Measurement data file (Doppler
power spectrum) is saved into hard drive. The data is read into, e.g.
Matlab. The analysis is performed by taking the Fourier transformation
of the Doppler spectrum. The resulting temporal correlation function
Rt(∆*t*) is normalized such that max(abs(*R~t~*(∆*t*)))=1. Then the
function values left from the maximum i.e. the negative lags are cut
out. Further on the function values after five periods are cut out.

**Time Domain Alternate Method**

Time domain techniques can also be used to validate the temporal
correlation. The temporal correlation validation measurement setup is
illustrated in Figure C.3.3-2. In this case a Signal generator transmits
a CW signal through the MIMO test system. The signal is received by a
test antenna within the test area. Finally, the signal is collected by a
signal analyser and the measured signal is stored as IQ data format for
postprocessing.

The time domain doppler spectrum is measured by the signal analyser and
the trace in IQ format is saved. Follow the same procedure to post
process the data and calculate the temporal correlation curve. Data
recording is synchronized with the channel emulator trigger.

The settings for the signal analyser are in Table C.3.3-4.

C.3.4 Spatial correlation
-------------------------

This measurement checks whether the measured correlation curve follows
the theoretical curve. For spatial correlation validation measurement,
only Vertical validation measurement is required. Spatial correlation
validation is only adopted for FR1 MIMO OTA.

The spatial correlation validation measurement setup is illustrated in
Figure C.3.4-1. The network analyser transmits signals through the
fading emulator and probes. The 16 probes radiate the signals within the
anechoic chamber and a receiving test antenna is placed within the test
zone. The test antenna is attached to a positioner that can move the
antenna to pre-defined spatial locations on a fixed radius from the
centre of the quiet zone. The received signal is measured with the
network analyser.

The measurement and analysis procedure are as follows:

> Set the target channel model to fading emulator:

1\) For each position of the test antenna in the test zone, step & pause
the emulator to different time instances. Measure the frequency
responses ![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) for all
stepped channel snapshots
![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png), where the interval
between frequency and time samples is
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) and
![](./media/image27.png)![](./media/image27.png), respectively. The
number of channel snapshots $N$ and frequency samples $M$ should be
sufficiently high so that the matrix can be estimated reliably.

2\) Move the measurement antenna with a positioner to another location
$k$ and repeat step 2 to record frequency responses
![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png) of all stepped channel
snapshots.

3\) Repeat step 3 to record frequency responses at all
![](./media/image29.png)![](./media/image29.png) spatial sample points.

4\) Stack measured time and frequency samples to a vector and calculate
correlation between the first spatial sample point (i.e. $k = 1$) and
other spatial points ![](./media/image30.png)![](./media/image30.png).

5\) ![](./media/image31.png).

6\) Take the theoretical reference spatial correlation of the
corresponding spatial sample points. Plot both the measured and
theoretical curves.

7\) Calculate the weighted RMS correlation error between the measured
and the reference.

##### Spatial samples {#spatial-samples .H6}

The spatial samples for the correlation validation measurement are on
the circumference of the quiet zone, as illustrated in Figure C.3.4-4.
The test zone is a circle with 20 cm diameter in the horizontal plane.
The reference point (denoted by a red marker) is in AoA 270°. The mean
AoAs of the CDL-C UMi and CDL-C UMa models are slightly different, but
the underlying geometry for the CDL model indicates that the mean AoA
(or assumed LoS direction) of the model is 180°. The reference point
orientation of the validation measurement is proposed to be with 90°
offset to the channel model reference AoA to enable accurate sampling of
the main lobe of the spatial correlation curve. The reference point
orientation has to be defined in the channel model coordinate system,
see Figure A.2.1-3, instead of the chamber/probe coordinate system to
enable optimization of OTA model implementation to achieve better
alignment with the cluster AoAs and probe directions. In order to have
spatial samples that yield reasonable measurement times and adequately
capture the main lobe of the correlation curve, a non-uniform sampling
is used where the first quadrant i.e. 270°-180°, is sampled with dense
sampling compared to the rest of the circle. The spacing of the spatial
samples is summarized in Table C.3.4-3 for test frequencies less than
1800 MHz and equal to or greater than 1800 MHz.

##### Time Domain Alternative Method: {#time-domain-alternative-method .H6}

Time domain techniques can also be used to validate the spatial
correlation. The spatial correlation validation measurement setup is
illustrated in Figure C.3.4-3. In this case a Signal generator transmits
a CW signal through the MIMO test system. The signal is received by a
test antenna within the test area. Finally, the signal is collected by a
signal analyser and the measured signal is stored for postprocessing.

Figure C.3.4-6: Configuration for spatial correlation validation based
on time domain techniques

For each spatial point, the channel emulator should issue a trigger
signal each time fading is started. For each point collect a time domain
trace with the signal analyser, when done, stop fading. Data recording
is synchronized with the channel emulator trigger.

Follow the same procedure to postprocess the data and calculate the
spatial correlation by setting *m* to 1. The settings for the Signal
Generator and Signal Analyser are in Tables C.3.4-6 and C.3.4-7

**Measurement Procedure:**

Step the emulation and store traces from VNA. i.e. run the emulation to
CIR number 1, pause, measure VNA trace, run the emulation to CIR number
10, pause, measure VNA trace. Continue until 1000 VNA traces are
measured:

a\. Use a vertically polarized sleeve dipole to measure the V component.

b\. Use a horizontally polarized (vertically oriented) magnetic loop
dipole, or a horizontally polarized sleeve dipole measured in four
orthogonal horizontal positions and summed to measure the H component.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**

Measured VNA traces (frequency responses $H_{V}(t,f)$ and
$H_{H}\left( t,f \right)$ are saved into a hard drive. The data is read
into, e.g. Matlab. The frequency responses are averaged in power over
time and frequency and the V/H ratio calculated as follows:

$P_{V} = \sum_{t}^{}{\sum_{f}^{}\left| H_{V}(t,f) \right|^{2}}\text{\ \ }$

$P_{H} = \sum_{t}^{}{\sum_{f}^{}\left| H_{H}\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}\text{\ \ \ }$

$P_{V/H}\lbrack dB\rbrack = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{P_{V}}{P_{H}} \right)$

**Beam-Specific Block Diagram**

It is assumed that the beams are mapped to the inputs of the channel
emulator as follows:

\- Beam 1: Input 1 and Input 2

\- Beam 2: Input 3 and Input 4 (CDL-C UMa only)

**Measurement Procedure:**

1\) Place a vertical reference dipole in the centre of the test zone
connected to a spectrum analyser (or power meter) via a cable.

2\) Record the cable and reference dipole gains.

3\) Load the target channel model into the channel emulator and play the
model.

4\) Start the NR FR1 signalling in the base station emulator with the
required parameter identical to the measurements conditions.

5\) Average the power received by the spectrum analyser for a sufficient
amount of time to account for the fading channel - one full channel
simulation might be unnecessary.

6\) Repeat steps 1 to 4 with a magnetic loop for the horizontal
polarization, or a horizontally polarized sleeve dipole measured in at
least four orthogonal horizontal positions and average the summed
orientations to get the H component.

7\) Calculate the total power received at the test area as the sum of
the power in the two polarizations.

NOTE: In step 6, if horizontally polarized sleeve dipole is used, the
reference gain correction should be the average of the theta gain
pattern cut of the dipole. Besides, more horizontal positions for
averaging will improve the measurement accuracy but increase the total
measurement time.

The power validation result is considered as systematic offset, which
needs to be corrected on the UE final sensitivity value to further
reduce measurement uncertainty.

The detailed power validation setup for CDL-C UMi and CDL-C UMa channel
models are illustrated in Figure C.3.6‑2 and Figure C.3.6-3.

C.4.4 Pass/Fail Criteria of Spatial correlation
-----------------------------------------------

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria of spatial correlation, this
general pass/fail limits principle apply for all channel models in all
FR1 frequency bands, for both combined and individual beams.

The pass/fail limits for spatial correlation are formed as bands of ±10%
of correlation capped at 100 % for the upper limit for target
correlation defined in clause C.3.4 of 35 % (for CDL-C UMa \@3600MHz,
this value is 65 %) and above. For target correlations below 35 % (for
CDL-C UMa \@3600MHz, this value is 65 %), the band is widened to ±20 %
capped at 0 %.

For the detailed pass/fail limit, the values are defined in the Table
C.4.4-1 and Table C.4.4-2, for CDL-C UMi and CDL-C UMa channel model,
respectively.

######## Annex E (normative): Environmental requirements

E.1 Scope
=========

The requirements in this clause apply to all types of UE(s) in FR1.

E.2 Ambient temperature
=======================

All the MIMO OTA requirements are applicable in room temperature e.g.
25°C.

E.3 Operating voltage
=====================

For FR1 MIMO OTA, all test cases shall be performed in the normal
voltage condition with the DUT operated in stand-alone battery powered
mode. No extreme voltage testing is required. It is recommended to start
testing with a fully charged battery and conclude and/or pause testing
before the battery has completely lost its charge.

######## Annex F (normative): Maximum uncertainty of test system and test tolerance

F.1 Maximum uncertainty of test system
======================================

5.  The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified
    in Table F.1-1 for each test, where appropriate. The Test System
    shall enable each test to be measured with an uncertainty not
    exceeding the specified values. All ranges and uncertainties are
    absolute values and are valid for a confidence level of 95 %.

    In Annex B, the estimation of measurement uncertainty is defined.

F.2 Test tolerances
===================

15. Test tolerances in Table F.2-1 are used to relax the Minimum
    Requirements in the present document and to derive the Test
    Requirements.
