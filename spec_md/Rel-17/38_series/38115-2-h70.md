Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR *Repeater* *type 2-O*. These have been
derived from, and are consistent with the radiated requirements for
*Repeater type 2-O* in Repeater specification defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\].

A *repeater type 1-C* only has conducted requirements so it does not
require compliance to this specification.

*Repeater type 2-O* have only radiated requirements so they require
compliance to this specification only.

4 General radiated test conditions and declarations
===================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 2
of this specification, i.e., to all radiated tests defined for FR2. The
FR2 frequency range is defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.106 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.106 \[2\]. Test Tolerances
for the radiated test requirements explicitly stated in the present
document are given in annex C of the present document.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

#### 4.1.2.2 Radiated characteristics measurements

The maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for radiated characteristics
measurements are given in tables 4.1.2.2-1. Details for derivation of
OTA Test System uncertainty are given in corresponding clauses in
TR 37.941 \[13\].

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545
\[3\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g., receiver tests,
this may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will
ensure that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not
increase the chance of passing a device under test where that device
would otherwise have failed the test if a Test System compliant with
clause 4.1.2 had been used.

4.2 Radiated requirement reference points
-----------------------------------------

For *repeater type 2-O*, the radiated characteristics are defined over
the air (OTA), where the operating band specific radiated interface is
referred to as the Radiated Interface Boundary (RIB). Radiated
requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial)
characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for
each requirement.

4.3 Repeater classes
--------------------

### 4.3.1 Repeater class for downlink

The requirements in this specification apply to downlink Wide Area
repeaters, downlink Medium Range repeaters and downlink Local Area
repeaters unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios
for each class are exactly the same for repeater with and without
connectors.

For *repeater type 2-O*, repeater downlink classes are defined as
indicated below:

\- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m.

### 4.3.2 Repeater class for uplink

The requirements in this specification apply to uplink Wide Area
repeaters and uplink Local Area repeaters unless otherwise stated. The
associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the same for
repeater with and without connectors.

For *repeater* *type 2-O*, repeater uplink classes are defined as
indicated below:

\- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

\- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

### 4.5.3 Power supply options

If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

#### 4.7.2.2 RTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of test configuration RTC1 is to test all repeater
requirements that need an input signal in the *passband* when there is
only one *passband* per *operating band*.

##### 4.7.2.2.1 RTC1 generation

RTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth supported shall be used
(D.27);

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower *passband* edge. If the width of the *passband* is
at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to be tested then place a
second signal adjacent to the upper *passband* edge. Otherwise
reposition the carrier to be tested according to the single carrier test
frequencies described in section 4.9.1.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis. All configured component carriers are transmitted simultaneously
in the tests where the repeater should be ON.

##### 4.7.2.2.2 RTC1 power allocation

Set the TRP of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the
test (i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

#### 4.7.2.4 RTC2: Non-contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of RTC2 is to test all repeater requirements that need an
input signal in the *passband* when there is more than one *passband*
per *operating band*.

##### 4.7.2.4.1 RTC2 generation

RTC2 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The repeater *passband* bandwidths shall be the declared maximum
repeater RF Bandwidth supported for multiple passbands (D.27). The
repeater RF Bandwidth consists of one sub-block gap and the two highest
and lowest declared *passbands*.

\- For each *passband*, select the carrier to be tested according to
4.7.2. If the width of the *passband* is at least twice that of the
carrier to be tested then place a carrier adjacent to the upper
*passband* edge and another carrier (as described in 4.7.2) adjacent to
the lower *passband* edge. Otherwise, tests shall be applied with one
carrier adjacent to the lower sub-block edge and one carrier adjacent to
the upper sub-block edge for each sub-block gap.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

##### 4.7.2.4.2 RTC2 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the
test (i.e., either P~in,p,EIRP~ or P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

4.8 Applicability of requirements
---------------------------------

4.8.1 Applicability of test configurations

be declared according to clause 4.6. The generation and power allocation
for each test configuration is defined in clause 4.7. This clause
contains the test configurations for a repeater capable of single
carrier, and/or multi-carrier operation in both contiguous and
non-contiguous spectrum in single band.

For a repeater declared to support a single *passband* within a single
band, the test configurations in the second column of table 4.8.1-1
shall be used for testing.

For a repeater declared to support more than one *passband* within a
single band (D.4) and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s
declaration according to clause 4.6 are identical for all passbands, the
test configurations in the third column of table 4.8.1-1 shall be used
for testing.

For a repeater declared to support more than one *passband* within a
single band (D.4) and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s
declaration according to clause 4.6 are not identical for all passbands,
the test configurations in the fourth column of table 4.8.1-1 shall be
used for testing.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single passband testing many tests in the present document are
performed with appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top
channels of the supported frequency range of the repeater. These are
denoted as RF channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
passband at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in the present document are performed with the maximum
*repeater RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom, middle and top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as
B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum *repeater RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum *repeater RF Bandwidth* located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum *repeater RF Bandwidth* located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single passband, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may
consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a repeater operates can either be contiguous
or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the
present specification apply for repeater configured for both contiguous
spectrum operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For repeater operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements
apply both at the repeater *passband* edges and inside the sub-block
gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the repeater *passband* edges and the sub-block edges
respectively.

4.11 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

X Title

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

X.1 Definition and applicability

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

X.2 Minimum requirement

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.

X.3 Test purpose

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

X.4 Method of test

X.4.1 General

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

X.4.2y First test method

X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up. The OTA Test System is assumed to be correctly calibrated as
part of the initial conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.

X.4.2y.2 Procedure

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like domain (e.g.
frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms
(e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g.
average result from several measurement positions).

X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

X.5 Test requirement

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 (Interpretation of measurement results). Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

4.12 Reference coordinate system
--------------------------------

Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic
characteristics (e.g. EIRP) at certain angles with respect to the
repeater. To be able to declare radiated characteristics part of
radiated requirements a reference coordinate system is required. The
reference coordinate system should be associated to an identifiable
physical feature on the repeater enclosure. The location of the origin
and the orientation of the reference coordinate system are for the
repeater manufacturer to declare.

The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate
system with rectangular axis (x***,*** y***,*** z) and spherical angles
(θ, φ) as showed in figure 4.12-1.

![](./media/image12.emf){width="3.933333333333333in"
height="4.066666666666666in"}

Figure 4.12-1: Reference coordinate system

φ*** ***is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the
projection of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined
between -180° and +180°, inclusive. θ*** *** is the angle between the
projection of the vector in the x***/***y plane and the radiating vector
and is defined between -90° and +90°, inclusive. Note that θ is defined
as positive along the down-tilt angle.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the NR operation in NR operating bands specification, their channel
bandwidth configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as
synchronization raster specification, refer to TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 5
and its relevant clauses.

For the radiated testing purposes in this specification, only FR2-1
operating bands are considered.

6 Radiated characteristics
==========================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the radiated characteristics are specified at
RIB for *repeater type 2-O* configuration in normal operating
conditions.

Requirements apply in both DL and UL unless otherwise stated, or
declared.

\- For the DL the BS-side RIB is the input and the UE-side RIB is the
output.

\- For the UL the UE-side RIB is the input and the BS-side RIB is the
output.

General test conditions for radiated tests of the *repeater type 2-O*
are given in clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results
and configurations for testing. Repeater configurations for the tests
are defined in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band RIB* have been declared equivalent (D.x),
only a representative one is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.

6.2 OTA output power
--------------------

### 6.2.1 General

OTA output power includes both OTA output EIRP power and OTA output TRP.

### 6.2.2 OTA output power (EIRP)

#### 6.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam
at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each declared beam, the requirement is based on declarations
captured in clause 4.6 for a beam identifier (D.3), *reference beam
direction pair* (D.6), *rated beam EIRP* (D.9) at the beam\'s reference
direction pair, *OTA peak directions set* (D.7), the *beam direction
pairs* at the maximum steering directions (D.8) and their associated
*rated beam EIRP* and *beamwidth(s)* for reference *beam direction pair*
and maximum steering directions (D.10).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the repeater is declared to radiate at
the associated *beam peak direction*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in clause 6.2.4.

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *passbands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW) is
larger than 6%, two rated beam EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated beam EIRP
is:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

The repeater radiated transmit power requirements are specified at
*single-band RIB*.

If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.11, D.12), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.

The *repeater rated beam EIRP output power* for *repeater type 2-O* UL
transmission shall be within limits as specified in table 6.2.2.1-1.

of the repeater with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal generator) in
order that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna and
the correct angle of arrival for the input signal is achieved..

4\) Set the CW generator power at the RIB as shown in annex E with a

measured output TRP and the EIRP of the input signal.

9\) Repeat steps 2-8, shifting the offset frequency of the CW from the
edge of the *passband* from 200kHz to 10MHz in steps of 200kHz for each

6.5 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 6.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[4\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *passband* resulting from the modulation process
and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *repeater type 2-O*
transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power
Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE). OTA Unwanted
emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious
emissions requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined
in table 6.5.1-1 for *repeater type 2-O* for NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.5.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink *operating
band for repeater type 2-O*

  Repeater type         *Operating band* characteristics     Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  --------------------- ------------------------------------ ----------------
  *Repeater type 2-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz   1500

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* as described per requirement.

### 6.5.2 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
state*.

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.2.2.

#### 6.5.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement
shall be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.2.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex G.

1\) Place the repeater at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.5.2.5.

\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

4a) Set the input signal at the RIB according to the applicable test
configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
models RDL-FR2-TM1.1 and RUL-FR2-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input
power intended to produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ +
10dB.

4b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex G) whilst
maintaining the correct direction of arrival for the test signal.

6\) Measure the absolute power of the assigned channel frequency and the
(adjacent channel frequency).

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex G).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the
wanted channel and the adjacent channel using the measurements made in
Step 7.

9\) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.

NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the
assigned channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent
frequency channel.

10\) Measure OTA ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of the
passband edge as specified in table 6.5.2.5-1. In multiple carrier case
only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.

11\) For the OTA ACLR requirement applied inside *gap between
passbands*:

a\) Measure OTA ACLR inside *gap between passbands*, if applicable.

b\) Measure OTA CACLR inside *gap between passbands*, if applicable.

#### 6.5.2.5 Test requirements

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 6.5.2.5-1 for DL and UL for
Wide Area class and DL for Local Area class.

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 6.5.2.5-1a for UL for Local
Area class.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit is specified in table 6.5.2.5-2.

The OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit in table 6.5.2.5-2 or 6.5.2.5-5 or
the ACLR (CACLR) limit in table 6.5.2.5-1, 6.5.2.5-3 or 6.5.2.5-4,
whichever is less stringent, shall apply.

For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA ACLR
requirement in table 6.5.2.5-3 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR
requirement in table 6.5.2.5-4 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *gap between passbands* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
between passbands*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective passband edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.5.2.5-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.5.2.5-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *gap between passbands* shall be higher
than the value specified in table 6.5.2.5-4.

For *repeater type 2-O* *nominal repeater channel bandwidth* is
calculated as min(400MHz, BW*~passband~*).

### 6.5.3 OTA operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

The requirements of either clause 6.5.3.4.1 (Category A limits) or
clause 6.5.3.4.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*repeater type 2-O*) in
clause 6.5.4. In addition, the limits in clause 6.5.3.4.3 may also
apply.

Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits.

For *repeater type 2-O*, unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in contiguous CA, the requirements
apply to the frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the edge of the
*passband.* In addition, for a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *gap between passbands*.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *passband*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In addition, inside any *gap between passbands* for a *RIB* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the *limits* specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of
the *gap between passbands*. The *limit* for each *sub-block* is
specified in clauses 6.5.3.4.1 and 6.5.3.4.2 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passbands* bandwidth
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.3.2

#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I.

1\) Place the repeater at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- detection mode: true RMS.

\- As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g.
carrier leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the
measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the
measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

4a) Set the input signal at the RIB according to the applicable test
configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
models RDL-FR2-TM1.1and RUL-FR2-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power
intended to produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.

4b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex G) whilst
maintaining the correct direction of arrival for the test signal.

6\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For connector under test
declared to operate in non-contiguous spectrum, the emission within the
*sub-block gap* shall be measured using the specified measurement
bandwidth from the closest sub block edge.

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex G).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in Step 7.

#### 6.5.3.4 Test requirements

##### 6.5.3.4.1 OTA operating band unwanted emission limits (Category A)

*Repeater type 2-O* unwanted emissions shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in table 6.5.3.4.1‑1 or 6.5.3.4.1-2 or 6.5.3.4.1-3.

### 6.5.4 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

For *repeater type 2-O*, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits
apply from 30 MHz to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the
downlink *operating band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of the downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the downlink *operating band*,
where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.4.2.2.

#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex.

1\) Place the repeater at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- detection mode: true RMS.

4a) Set the input signal at the RIB according to the applicable test
configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
models RDL-FR2-TM1.1 and RUL-FR2-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input
power intended to produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ +
10dB.

4b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed with the specified
measurement bandwidth (see annex I) whilst maintaining the correct
direction of arrival for the test signal.

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex G).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in Step 7.

#### 6.5.4.5 Test requirements

##### 6.5.4.5.1 General

The requirements of either clause 6.5.4.5.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 6.5.4.5.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
Operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.5.3.

##### 6.5.4.5.2 OTA transmitter spurious emissions (Category A)

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
6.5.4.5.2-1

##### 6.5.4.5.4 Additional OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the repeater-Node. The limits
may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in
the same geographical area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.

##### 6.5.4.5.4.1 Limits for protection of Earth Exploration Satellite Service

For repeater operating in the frequency range 24.25 -- 27.5 GHz, the
power of any spurious emissions shall not exceed the limits in Table
6.5.4.5.4.1-1 and Table 6.5.4.5.4.1-2.

6.6 OTA Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
---------------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of the repeater and the
measured signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the
equalization by the measurement equipment. This difference is called the
error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are the
same as specified in TS 38.104 \[5\] Annex \[C\] for FR2. The repeater
EVM result is defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error
vector power to the mean reference power expressed in percent. The
accuracy of the input symbols is counted in the measurement uncertainty.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range*
on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of the received
signal is in the reference direction at the receive side.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is
operating with an input power level within the range from what is
required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (P~rated,p,EIRP~) to
the minimum power levels in table 6.6.1.1-1.

### 6.6.2 Uplink Repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference
between the reference waveform provided at the input of the repeater and
the measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is
called the error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is
determined are the same as specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F.
Before calculating the repeater EVM, the measured waveform is corrected
by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier
leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating
the repeater EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the repeater EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement
specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] sub-clauses 6.4.2.4 and 6.4.2.5. For
DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the
front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error
vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM
waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as
the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean
reference power expressed as a %. The accuracy of the input waveform is
counted in the measurement uncertainty.

The basic repeater EVM measurement interval is one slot in the time
domain. The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols
that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval
as defined in TS 38.101-2 clause 6.3.3 for EVM for UE.

All the parameters defined in clause 6.6.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range*
on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of the received
signal is in the reference direction at the receive side.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is
operating with an input power level within the range from what is
required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (P~rated,p,EIRP~) to
the minimum input power levels in table 6.6.2.1-1.

6.7 OTA input intermodulation
-----------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

#### 6.7.1.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the passband, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the passband.

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
repeater to maintain the wanted frequency free of internally created
interference.

The measurements shall apply to both uplink and downlink paths of the
repeater, during the *transmitter ON state* at maximum gain.

#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\] clause 7.7.2.

#### 6.7.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified by the minimum
requirements.

#### 6.7.1.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.

A measurement system set-up is shown in Annex E.

##### 6.7.1.4.2 Procedure

identifier.

6\) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the
passband, so that one carrier, f~1~, is 1 MHz outside the channel edge
frequency of the first or last channel in the passband, and the lowest
order intermodulation product from the two carriers is positioned in the
centre of the passband.

7\) Measure the increase in output power in the passband when the
interferer is applied

8\) Repeat the measurement for all supported polarizations and all
specified measurement directions.

9\) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the repeater.

#### 6.7.1.5 Test requirements

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.1.5-1, the power in the
*passband* shall not increase with more than:

\- 13.9 dB, 24.25 GHz \< f ≤ 29.5 GHz

\- 13.9 dB, 37 GHz \< f ≤ 43.5 GHz

\- 15.4 dB, 43.5 GHz \< f ≤ 48.2 GHz

at the output of the repeater as measured with 1 MHz measurement
bandwidth, compared to the level obtained without interfering signals
applied.

Table 6.7.1.5-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals,
where:

\- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the
first or last channel in the *passband* of the closer carrier.

\- G~RX\_ANT~ is the gain of the receive side antennas and is calculated
from EIRP and TRP declaration.

  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  1 MHz         -53dBm -- G~\_RX\_ANT~      2 CW carriers     1 MHz

6.8 OTA Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
-----------------------------------------------

### 6.8.1 Definitions and applicability

OTA Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average
gain over a carrier of the repeater in the *passband* to the average
gain of the repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater
*passband*. The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of
the Repeater. The bandwidth of the channel inside the *passband* and the
adjacent channel shall be of the same type (reference carrier) with
bandwidths as defined by *nominal channel bandwidth*.

The requirement is differentiated between downlink and uplink.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

The ACRR is a ratio of gain in the adjacent channel to gain in the
wanted channel. The gain in each case is defined as the ratio of TRP
output power to directional input power.

### 6.8.2 Co-existence with NR

input power at one of the channel offsets outside the repeater pass band
according to Tables in section 6.8.2.3.3.

12\) Repeat step 7) to 9) for the measurement of the input signal
outside the repeater pass-band.;

13\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of a
carrier over an adjacent channel outside the repeater *passband* and
using the measurements made in Step 9.

14\) Calculate relative ACRR estimate.

15\) Repeat step 5) to 14) until all channel offsets in Tables in
section 6.8.2.3.3 are measured.

##### 6.8.2.3.3 Test Requirements

of a received signal in the *passband* and a received signal on an
adjacent channel outside repeater *passband* is from the same direction
and are the same as the TX reference direction for the opposite DL/UL
setting*.*

For a repeater operating at passband operating in FR2, the ACRR
requirements in table 6.8.2.3.3-1 shall apply in downlink. In normal
conditions the ACRR for downlink shall be higher than the value
specified in the Table 6.8.2.3.3-1.

6.9 OTA transmit ON/OFF power
-----------------------------

### 6.9.1 OTA transmitter OFF power

#### 6.9.1.1 Definition and applicability

OTA transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over
70/N µs filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
*passband bandwidth* of the repeater (BW~passband~) centred on the
assigned channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF state*. N =
SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz of the input signal. The
OTA transmitter OFF power is defined as TRP.

#### 6.9.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.9.2.2.

#### 6.9.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the OTA transmitter OFF power is
within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.9.1.4 Method of test

Requirement is tested together with transmitter transient period, as
described in clause 6.9.2.4.

#### 6.9.1.5 Test requirements

The conformance testing of transmit OFF power is included in the
conformance testing of transmitter transient period; therefore, see
clause 6.9.2.5 for test requirements.

### 6.9.2 OTA transient period

#### 6.9.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which
the transmitter is changing from the tra*nsmitter OFF state* to the
*transmitter ON state* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient period*
is illustrated in figure 6.9.2.1-1.

Figure 6.9.2.1-1: Example of relations between transmitter *ON state*,
transmitter *OFF state* and *transmitter transient period*

This requirement shall be applied at each RIB supporting transmission in
the *operating band*.

For a repeater that is not declared to be a long delay repeater (D.24),
the beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced
to the slot timing at the input.

For a repeater that is declared to be a long delay repeater (D.24), the
beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced to
the slot timing at the input plus the declared repeater delay.

#### 6.9.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.9.3.2.

#### 6.9.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the OTA transmitter transient
periods are within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.9.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.9.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- The requirement is verified by an EIRP measurement at a direction
corresponding to the OTA peak directions set reference beam direction
pair (D.6) for the beam identifier (D.3) which provides the highest
intended EIRP.

##### 6.9.2.4.2 Procedure

1a) Place the repeater at the positioner.

1b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

4a) For trainsient period measurement, set the input signal at the RIB
according to the applicable test configuration and direction in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models RDL-FR2‑TM 1.1 and
RUL-FR2‑TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce
the maximum rated output power, P~rated,in,\ EIRP~ + 10dB.

4b)For OFF power measurement, set the signal generator RF output turned
off for not to generate input signal.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex G) whilst
maintaining the correct direction of arrival for the test signal.

6\) Measure the mean EIRP spectral density as the power sum over two
orthogonal polarizations over 70/N μs filtered with a square filter of
bandwidth equal to the *passband* bandwidth of the repeater centred on
the central frequency of the *passband*. 70/N μs average window centre
is set from 35/N μs after end of one transmitter ON state + 3 μs to 35/N
μs before start of next transmitter ON state- 3 μs. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

NOTE: Make sure that the measurement receiver is not overloaded.

#### 6.9.2.5 Test requirements

The measured mean EIRP spectral density shall be less than -33.1 +
P~rated,c,EIRP ~- P~rated,c,TRP~ dBm/MHz for carrier frequency 24.15 GHz
\< f ≤ 29.5 GHz, where P~rated,c,EIRP~ is the value declared for the
*reference beam direction pair* (D.6) for the beam identifier (D.3)
which provides the highest intended EIRP.

The measured mean EIRP spectral density shall be less than
-32.7 + P~rated,c,EIRP ~- P~rated,c,TRP~ dBm/MHz for carrier frequency
37 GHz \< f ≤ 43.5 GHz, where P~rated,c,EIRP~ is the value declared for
the *reference beam direction pair* (D.6) for the beam identifier (D.3)
which provides the highest intended EIRP.

The measured mean EIRP spectral density shall be less than
-32.4 + P~rated,c,EIRP ~- P~rated,c,TRP~ dBm/MHz for carrier frequency
43.5 GHz \< f ≤ 48.2 GHz, where P~rated,c,EIRP~ is the value declared
for the *reference beam direction pair* (D.6) for the beam identifier
(D.3) which provides the highest intended EIRP

######## Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the Repeater equipment

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the repeater is to be tested are defined.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table B.2.1.

Table B.2-1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment

  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[7\];

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[8\];

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[9\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.1 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[12\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex A.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the repeater test environments defined in
annex A shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex F (normative): In-channel TX tests

F.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the repeater under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

F.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a TDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 120 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 400
MHz (*N*~RB~ = 264). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

F.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling
rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it is named
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$.

For FR2, *FFT size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.6.3.5-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5‑3 in \[5\] for 120 kHz SCS.
In the time domain it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a
signal with the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.6.3.5-3 in \[5\]. The sampling rate of 491.52 Msps is the product of
the *FFT size* and SCS.

F.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal ![](./media/image19.png)![](./media/image19.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex F.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal ![](./media/image20.png)![](./media/image20.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters for FR1 and FR2:

\- nominal demodulation reference signal and nominal PT-RS if present
(all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex F.2.1 in the time domain.

F.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency stability.

\- EVM.

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

F.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure G.2.4-1. The FFT
window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT size* + cyclic prefix length)
samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\" box.

For FR2, *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length is determined from
table 6.6.3.5-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5‑3 in \[5\]for 120 kHz
SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.6.3.5-2 and table
6.6.3.5-3 in \[5\]. Table F.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol
number and the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for
those two symbols according to the sampling rate.

Table F.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP
length for normal CP

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SCS (kHz)   Frequency Range   \# slots in subframe   Symbol \# and slot \# with longer CP   Longer CP length

  15          FR1               1                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 128
                                                       (symbol 7, slot 0)                     

  30                            2                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 64
                                                       (symbol 0, slot 1)

                                                       (symbol 0, slot 2)                     

  60          FR2               4                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 32
                                                       (symbol 0, slot 2)                     

  120                           8                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 16
                                                       (symbol 0, slot 4)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4 has 256 more
samples in the cyclic prefix than the other symbols (the longer CP
length = 544).

Figure F.2.4-1: Reference point for FR2 EVM measurements

F.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample timing, carrier frequency in
![](./media/image22.png)![](./media/image22.png) are varied in order to
minimise the difference between
![](./media/image22.png)![](./media/image22.png) and
![](./media/image19.png)![](./media/image19.png), after the amplitude
ratio of ![](./media/image22.png)![](./media/image22.png) and
![](./media/image19.png)![](./media/image19.png) has been scaled. Best
fit (minimum difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value
between ![](./media/image22.png)![](./media/image22.png) and
![](./media/image19.png)![](./media/image19.png) is an absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples in between the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequency error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinguish between both.

After this process the samples
![](./media/image22.png)![](./media/image22.png) are called
![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png).

F.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For TDD,
the number of FFTs performed is the number of downlink symbols in the
measurement interval.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 832 FFTs (i.e., 3,407,872 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 3,651,584 samples in 10 ms). There are
816 symbols with 4384 samples and 16 symbols with 4640 samples.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called
![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png),

\- ![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png), and

\- ![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png).

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from the transmission
bandwidth and table 6.6.3.5-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5-3 in
TS 38.104 \[5\] for 120 kHz SCS.

The repeater shall transmit a signal according to the test models
intended for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal
signal shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre FFT domain as
follows, using ![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png) and
![](./media/image20.png)![](./media/image20.png):

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal
![](./media/image20.png)![](./media/image20.png), the timing is known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal ![](./media/image20.png)![](./media/image20.png) is
a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the ideal signal
![](./media/image20.png)![](./media/image20.png) and the data in the
measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of
more than one highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the
measured signal.

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to
![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png). This subset of samples
is called ![](./media/image27.png)![](./media/image27.png).

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre
![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) is determined according
to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal CP, there
are two values for ![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) in a
1 ms period:

\- ![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) = length of cyclic
prefix / 2,

\- ![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) = Longer CP length -
length of cyclic prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.6.3.5-2 for
60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5-3 in TS 38.104 \[5\] for 120 kHz SCS, and
the longer CP length is obtained from table F.2.4-1.

As per the example values.

\- ![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png) within the CP of
length 288 for most OFDM symbols in 1 ms,

\- ![](./media/image29.png)![](./media/image29.png) (= 544 -- 144)
within the CP of length 544 for OFDM symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4.

F.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on ![](./media/image30.png)![](./media/image30.png) with the
FFT window timing ![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png).

The result is called ![](./media/image31.png)![](./media/image31.png).
The RE TX (RETP) power is then defined as:

$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$

where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP, the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$$\text{OSTP} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}â_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$

Where the summation accumulates
![](./media/image32.png)![](./media/image32.png) values of all *N~sym~*
OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not containing PDCCH, RS or SSB within
a slot.

![](./media/image33.png)![](./media/image33.png).

From the acquired samples
![](./media/image34.png)![](./media/image34.png) values for each OSTP
can be obtained and averaged where
![](./media/image34.png)![](./media/image34.png) is the number of slots
with downlink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval and is computed
according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1 in \[5\].

For the example used in the annex,
![](./media/image35.png)![](./media/image35.png) and
![](./media/image36.png)![](./media/image36.png).

F.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform ![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png) FFTs on
![](./media/image30.png)![](./media/image30.png), one for each OFDM
symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing to
produce an array of samples,
![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png) in the time axis *t* by
*FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 1120 FFTs are performed on
![](./media/image30.png)![](./media/image30.png). The result is an array
of samples, 1120 in the time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) and
![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png) are determined as
follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image31.png)![](./media/image31.png) and the
post-FFT ideal signal ![](./media/image40.png)![](./media/image40.png),
for each demodulation reference signal, over 10 ms measurement interval.
This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image41.png)![](./media/image41.png)

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image42.png)![](./media/image42.png) an unwrap operation
must be performed according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
![](./media/image42.png)![](./media/image42.png) by adding multiples of
2 \* π when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) are greater than or
equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png)

![](./media/image45.png)![](./media/image45.png)

\- Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signal time-domain
locations ![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) from
![](./media/image31.png)![](./media/image31.png) for each demodulation
reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image46.png)![](./media/image46.png) and
![](./media/image47.png)![](./media/image47.png) at the demodulation
reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving
average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged demodulation
reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window size is 19 and
averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when the number of
available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs
is smaller than the moving average window size, the window size is
reduced accordingly as per figure F.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image48.png)![](./media/image48.png) and
![](./media/image47.png)![](./media/image47.png) to compute coefficients
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png),
![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png) for each subcarrier.

millimetre wave frequencies,

coefficients contain phase rotation due to the CPE,
![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png), in addition to the
phase of the equalizer coefficient
![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png), that is:

![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png)

For OFDM symbols where PT-RS does not exist,
![](./media/image53.png)![](./media/image53.png) can be estimated by
performing linear interpolation from neighboring symbols where PT-RS is
present.

In order to separate component of the
CPE,![](./media/image54.png)![](./media/image54.png), contained in,
![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png), estimation and
compensation of the CPE needs to

phase error (CPE), that rotates all the subcarriers of the OFDM symbol
at time ![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png).

Estimate of the CPE, ![](./media/image53.png)![](./media/image53.png),
at OFDM symbol time, ![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png),
can then be obtained from using the PT-RS employing the expression:

![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png)

In the above equation, ![](./media/image58.png)![](./media/image58.png)
is the set of subcarriers where PT-RS are mapped,
![](./media/image59.png)![](./media/image59.png) where
![](./media/image60.png)![](./media/image60.png) is the set of OFDM
symbols where PT-RS are mapped while
![](./media/image61.png)![](./media/image61.png) and
![](./media/image62.png)![](./media/image62.png) are is the post-FFT
acquired signal and the ideal PT-RS signal respectively. That is,
estimate of the CPE at a given OFDM symbol is obtained from frequency
correlation of the complex ratios at the PT-RS positions with the
conjugate of the estimated equalizer complex coefficients. The estimated
CPE can be subtracted from
![](./media/image63.png)![](./media/image63.png) to remove influence of
the CPE, and obtain estimate of the complex coefficient\'s phase:

F.7 EVM
=======

F.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according
to the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer
coefficients from F.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
![](./media/image19.png)![](./media/image19.png) (annex F.2.2) and are
called $I\left( t,f \right)$.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

![](./media/image65.png)![](./media/image65.png)

Where:

\- *T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

\- ![](./media/image66.png)![](./media/image66.png) is the set of
subcarriers within the resource blocks with the considered modulation
scheme being active in symbol *t*,

\- ![](./media/image67.png)![](./media/image67.png) *is* the ideal
signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in accordance with
relevant test models,

\- ![](./media/image68.png)![](./media/image68.png) is the equalized
signal under test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

F.7.1 Averaged EVM
------------------

Let ![](./media/image69.png)![](./media/image69.png) be the number of
slots with downlink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For
TDD, the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from
![](./media/image69.png)![](./media/image69.png) slots of different 10
ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum of
![](./media/image34.png)![](./media/image34.png) slots averaging length
where ![](./media/image34.png)![](./media/image34.png) is the number of
slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

![](./media/image70.png)![](./media/image70.png) is derived by: Square
the EVM results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares,
divide the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

![](./media/image71.png)![](./media/image71.png)

*Where* ![](./media/image72.png)![](./media/image72.png) is the number
of resource blocks with the considered modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The ![](./media/image73.png)![](./media/image73.png) is calculated,
using the maximum of ![](./media/image70.png)![](./media/image70.png)at
the window *W* extremities. Thus
![](./media/image74.png)![](./media/image74.png) is calculated using
![](./media/image75.png)![](./media/image75.png) and
![](./media/image76.png)![](./media/image76.png) is calculated
using![](./media/image77.png)![](./media/image77.png) (*l* and *h*, low
