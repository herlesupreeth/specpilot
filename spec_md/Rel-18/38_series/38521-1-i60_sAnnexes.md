######## Annex A (normative): Measurement channels

A.1 General
===========

The throughput values defined in the measurement channels specified in
Annex A, are calculated and are valid per datastream (codeword). For
multi-stream (more than one codeword) transmissions, the throughput
referenced in the minimum requirements is the sum of throughputs of all
datastreams (codewords).

The UE category entry in the definition of the reference measurement
channel in Annex A is only informative and reveals the UE categories,
which can support the corresponding measurement channel. Whether the
measurement channel is used for testing a certain UE category or not is
specified in the individual minimum requirements.

A.2 UL reference measurement channels
=====================================

A.2.1 General
-------------

The measurement channels in the following subclauses are defined to
derive the requirements in clause 6 (Transmitter Characteristics) and
clause 7 (Receiver Characteristics). The measurement channels represent
example configurations of physical channels for different data rates.

The measurement channels in the following clauses are applicable to both
FDD and TDD.

The active uplink slots for TDD configurations are specified in table
A.2.1-1. TDD slot patterns defined for reference sensitivity tests will
be used for TDD UL RMCs, unless otherwise stated. The active uplink
slots for additional TDD configuration specified in Table A.2.1-3, with
the TDD pattern defined in Table A.2.1-4, is used for the phase
continuity tests for DMRS bundling with 15 kHz SCS. The active uplink
slots configuration specified in Table A.2.1-5 and the additional TDD
pattern in Table A.2.1-6 are used for shorter transient period
capability EVM tests at 15 kHz SCS.

A.7 V2X reference measurement channels
======================================

A.7.1 General
-------------

The algorithm for determining the payload size A is as follows; given a
desired coding rate R and radio block allocation NRB

1\. Calculate the RE number of 2nd stage SCI Q\_SCI2\^\' that can be
transmitted in a given sub-frame, where in order to make sure that the
code-rate of 2-A is approximate to SCI 1-A, a beta offset is selected
based on MCS, and vacant resource elements γ value is determined based
on NRB and DMRS frequency density.

2\. Transport Block Size is determined according to clause 8.1.3.2 of TS
38.214 \[12\] based on Table A.7.1-1.

3\. Calculate Binary Channel Bits per Slot for PSSCH as below.

Binary Channel Bits per Slot = (NRB\* Subcarriers per resource
block\*CP-OFDM symbols per slot -- DMRS resource REs -- PSCCH resource
Res - Q\_SCI2\^\') \* Qm

Where Qm is the modulation order corresponding to MCS.

In Table A.7.1-1 Common reference channel parameters are listed the
Sidelink reference measurement channels specified in annexes A.7.2 to
A.7.4.

########  Annex B (normative): Propagation Conditions

The propagation conditions and channel models for various environments
are specified. For each environment a propagation model is used to
evaluate the propagation pathless due to the distance. Channel models
are formed by combining delay profiles with a Doppler spectrum, with the
addition of correlation properties in the case of a multi-antenna
scenario.

B.0 No interference
===================

The downlink connection between the System Simulator and the UE is
without Additive White Gaussian Noise, and has no fading or multipath
effects.

######## Annex C (normative): Downlink physical channels

This annex specifies the downlink physical channels that are needed for
setting a connection and channels that are needed during a connection.

C.0 Downlink signal levels
==========================

The downlink power settings in Table C.0-1 is used unless otherwise
specified in a test case.

If the UE has more than one Rx antenna, the downlink signal is applied
to each one. All UE Rx antennas shall be connected.

If the UE has one Rx antenna, the downlink signal is applied to it.

######## Annex D (normative): Characteristics of the Interfering Signal

D.1 General
===========

Some RF performance requirements for the NR UE receiver are defined with
interfering signals present in addition to the wanted signal.

For NR bands with F~DL\_high~\< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~\< 2700 MHz, a
modulated 5MHz full bandwidth NR down link signal, and in some cases an
additional CW signal, are used as interfering signal.

For NR bands with F~DL\_low~≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~≥ 3300 MHz, a
modulated NR downlink signal which equals to channel bandwidth of the
wanted signal for Single Carrier case and Inter-band CA case is used as
interfering. For intra-band contiguous CA Bandwidth Class C case, a
modulated NR downlink signal which equals to the aggregated channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal is used. For intra-band contiguous CA
Bandwidth Class D and E case, a modulated 50MHz NR downlink signal is
used. And in some cases, an additional CW signal is used.

different channel bandwidth options for NR band lower than 2700MHz.

######## Annex E (normative): Global In-Channel TX-Test

NOTE: Clauses E.2.2 to E.5.9.3 are descriptions, which assume no power
ramping adjacent to the measurement period.

E.1 General
===========

The global in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

E.2 Signals and results
=======================

E.2.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of
the TX under test**, received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference
signal**, that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an
ideal error free received signal. All signals are represented as
equivalent (generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers as examples. These numbers are taken
from FDD with normal CP length and 100 MHz bandwidth with 30 kHz SCS.
The application of the text below, however, is not restricted to this
frame structure and bandwidth.

E.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling
rate of 122.88 Mbps. In the time domain it comprises at least n uplink
slots, where for basic EVM measurement,

;

For Error Vector Magnitude including symbols with transient periods

$n = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
108\ for\ 15\ kHz\ SCS \\
216\ for\ 30\ kHz\ SCS \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

The measurement period is derived by concatenating the correct number of
individual uplink slots until the correct measurement period is reached.
The output signal is named z(ν). Each slot is modelled as a signal with
the following parameters: demodulated data content, carrier frequency,
amplitude and phase for each subcarrier, timing, carrier leakage.

Since the uplink subframes are not continuous, *n* slots should be
extracted from more than 1 continuous radio frame.

E.2.3 Reference signal
----------------------

Two types of reference signal are defined:

The reference signal i~1~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following
parameters: demodulated data content, nominal carrier frequency, nominal
amplitude and phase for each subcarrier, nominal timing, no carrier
leakage. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a sampling rate
of 122.88 Msps in the time domain.

The reference signal i~2~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following
parameters: restricted data content: nominal reference symbols, (all
modulation symbols for user data symbols are set to 0V), nominal carrier
frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,
nominal timing, no carrier leakage. It is represented as a sequence of
samples at a sampling rate of 122.88 Msps in the time domain.

NOTE: The PUCCH is off during the time under test.

E.2.4 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the global in channel TX test are
the following:

\- Carrier Frequency error

\- EVM (Error Vector Magnitude)

\- Carrier leakage

\- Unwanted emissions, falling into non allocated resource blocks.

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

E.2.5 Measurement points
------------------------

The unwanted emission falling into non-allocated RB(s) is calculated
directly after the FFT as described below. In contrast to this, the EVM
for the allocated RB(s) is calculated after the IDFT for DFT-s-OFDM or
after the Tx-Rx chain equalizer for CP-OFDM. The samples after the TX-RX
chain equalizer are used to calculate EVM equalizer spectrum flatness.
Carrier frequency error and carrier leakage is calculated in the block
"RF correction".

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via
*txDirectCurrentLocation* IE (as defined in TS 38.331 \[6\]), carrier
leakage measurement in the RF correction block shall be omitted. All
statements from Annex E.3 onwards shall be read assuming that no carrier
leakage has been measured.

E.3 Signal processing
=====================

E.3.1 Pre FFT minimization process
----------------------------------

Before applying the pre-FFT minimization process, z(ν) and i(ν) are
portioned into *n* pieces, comprising one slot each, where *n* is as
defined in Annex E.2.2. For handling of sidelink transmission, the
transmission gap of one symbol at the end of each slot is excluded in
following process.

Each slot is processed separately. Sample timing, Carrier frequency and
carrier leakage in z(ν) are jointly varied in order to minimise the
difference between z(ν) and i(ν). Best fit (minimum difference) is
achieved when the RMS difference value between z(ν) and i(ν) is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation and the IQ variation are the measurement
results: Carrier Frequency Error and Carrier leakage.

From the acquired samples 10 carrier frequencies can be derived by
averaging frequency errors for every 1, 2 or 4 slots for 15, 30 and 60
kHz SCS.

From the acquired samples *n* carrier frequencies and *n* carrier
leakages can be derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive carrier leakage and RF error
can be supported by Post FFT operations. However the minimisation
process defined in the pre FFT domain comprises all acquired samples
(i.e. it does not exclude the samples in between the FFT widths and it
does not exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth
configuration

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow deriving Carrier Frequency error and
Sample Frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for Sample Frequency error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinguish between both.

After this process the samples z(ν) are called z^0^(ν).

E.3.2 Timing of the FFT window
------------------------------

The FFT window length is 4096 samples per OFDM symbol. 14 FFTs (57344
samples) cover less than the acquired number of samples (61440 samples).
The position in time for FFT must be determined.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window W\<CP. There
are three different instants for FFT:

Centre of the reduced window, called
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"},
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} --W/2 and
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} +W/2.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre FFT domain as
follows, using z^0^(ν) and i~2~(ν) :

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct boarders between the OFDM symbols and between Data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the Reference Signal i~2~(ν) the timing is known.

3\. Correlation between (1.) and (2.) will result in a correlation peak.
The meaning of the correlation peak is approx. the "impulse response" of
the TX filter. The meaning of "impulse response" assumes that the
autocorrelation of the reference signal i~2~(ν) is a Dirac peak and that
the correlation between the reference signal i~2~(ν) and the data in the
measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of
more than one, the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured
signal.

From the acquired samples, *n* timings can be derived, where *n* is as
defined in Annex E.2.2.

For all calculations, except EVM, the number of samples in z^0^(ν) is
reduced to 14 blocks of samples, comprising 4096 samples (FFT width) and
starting with ![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} in each OFDM symbol including the
demodulation reference signal.

For the EVM calculation the output signal under test is reduced to 28
blocks of samples, comprising 4096 samples (FFT width) and starting with
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} --W/2 and
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} +W/2 in each OFDM symbol including the
demodulation reference signal.

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to z^0^(ν). This
subset of samples is called z'(ν).

The timing of the centre
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} with respect to the different CP length
in a slot is as follows: (FDD, normal CP length)

![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} is on T~f~=144 (=CP/2) within the CP of
length 288 FFT samples (in OFDM symbols except 0 and 14
(=$7 \cdot 2^{\mu}$), where symbol 0 is the first symbol of each
subframe) for 100 MHz channel bandwidth and SCS = 30 kHz.

![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} is on T~f~=208 (=352-144) within the CP
of length 352 FFT samples (in OFDM symbol 0 and 14 (=$7 \cdot 2^{\mu}$),
where symbol 0 is the first symbol of each subframe) for 100 MHz channel
bandwidth and SCS = 30 kHz.

E.3.3 Post FFT equalisation
---------------------------

Perform 14 FFTs on z'(ν), one for each OFDM symbol in a slot using the
timing ![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}, including the demodulation reference
symbol. The result is an array of samples, 14 in the time axis t times
4096 in the frequency axis f. The samples represent the data symbols (in
OFDM-symbol 0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13 in each slot) and demodulation
reference symbols (OFDM symbol 2, 7, 11 in each slot) in the allocated
RBs and inband emissions in the non-allocated RBs within the
transmission BW.

Only the allocated resource blocks in the frequency domain are used for
equalisation.

The nominal demodulation reference symbols and nominal data symbols are
used to equalize the measured data symbols. (Location for equalization
see Figure E.2.5-1)

NOTE: The nomenclature inside this note is local and not valid outside.

The nominal data symbols are created by a demodulation process. The
location to gain the demodulated data symbols is "EVM" in Figure
E.2.5-1. For CP-OFDM, the process described in Annex E.5 can be applied.
A demodulation process as follows is recommended for DFT-s-OFDM:

1\. Equalize the measured data symbols using the reference symbols for
equalisation. Result: Equalized data symbols

2\. Only for DFT-s-OFDM, iDFT transform the equalized data symbols:
Result: Equalized data symbols

3\. Decide for the nearest constellation point: Result: Nominal data
symbols

4\. Only for DFT-s-OFDM, DFT transform the nominal data symbols: Result:
Nominal data symbols

At this stage we have an array of [M]{.underline}easured
data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and reference-[S]{.underline}ymbols (MS(f,t))

versus an array of [N]{.underline}ominal data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and
reference [S]{.underline}ymbols (NS(f,t))

(complex, the arrays comprise 11 data symbols and 3 demodulation
reference symbol in the time axis and the number of allocated
subcarriers in the frequency axis.)

MS(f,t) and NS(f,t) are processed with a least square (LS) estimator, to
derive one equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated
subcarrier. EC(f) is defined as

![](./media/image6.png){width="2.3645833333333335in"
height="0.4895833333333333in"}.

With \* denoting complex conjugation.

EC(f) are used to equalize the DFT-coded data symbols. The measured
DFT-coded data and the references symbols are equalized by:

Z'(f,t) = MS(f,t) **^.^** EC(f)

With **^.^** denoting multiplication.

Z'(f,t), restricted to the data symbol (excluding t=2,7,11) is used to
calculate EVM, as described in E.4.1.

EC(f) is used in E.4.4.1 to calculate EVM equalizer spectral flatness.

NOTE: The post FFT minimisation process is done over 14 symbols (11
DFT-coded data symbols and 3 reference symbols).

The samples of the non-allocated resource blocks within the transmission
bandwidth configuration in the post FFT domain are called Y(f,t) (f
covering the non-allocated subcarriers within the transmission bandwidth
configuration, t covering the OFDM symbols during 1 slot).

E.4 Derivation of the results
=============================

E.4.1 EVM
---------

For EVM create two sets of Z'(f,t)., according to the timing "
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} --W/2 and
![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} +W/2" using the equalizer coefficients
from E.3.3.

Perform the iDFTs on Z'(f,t) in the case of DFT-s-OFDM waveform. The
IDFT-decoding preserves the meaning of t but transforms the variable f
(representing the allocated sub carriers) into another variable g,
covering the same count and representing the demodulated symbols. The
samples in the post IDFT domain are called iZ'(g, t). The equivalent
ideal samples are called iI(g,t). Those samples of Z'(f,t), carrying the
reference symbols (=symbol 2,7,11) are not iDFT processed.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal waveform and the measured
and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s)

![](./media/image7.wmf){width="2.9166666666666665in" height="0.75in"},

where

t covers the count of demodulated symbols with the considered modulation
scheme being active within the measurement period, (i.e. symbol
0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13 in each slot, \|T\|=11)

g covers the count of demodulated symbols with the considered modulation
scheme being active within the allocated bandwidth.

From the acquired samples *2n* EVM values can be derived, *n* values for
the timing ![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"

E.2.2.

E.4.2 Averaged EVM
------------------

EVM is averaged over all basic EVM measurements.

The averaging comprises *n* UL slots

$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\text{EVM}_{i}^{2}}$$

where *n* is as defined in Annex E.2.2for PUCCH, PUSCH.

The averaging is done separately for timing¦

height="0.2708333333333333in"} is compared against the test
requirements.

E.4.3 In-band emissions measurement
-----------------------------------

The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the
non-allocated resources blocks.

Explanatory Note:

The inband emission measurement is only meaningful with allocated RB(s)
next to non-allocated RB. The allocated RB(s) are necessary but not
under test. The non-allocated RBs are under test. The RB allocation for
this test is as follows: The allocated RB(s) are at one end of the
channel BW, leaving the other end unallocated. The number of allocated
RB(s) is smaller than half of the number of RBs, available in the
channel BW. This means that the vicinity of the carrier in the centre is
unallocated.

There are 3 types of inband emissions:

1\. General

2\. IQ image

3\. Carrier leakage

*Carrier leakage* are inband emissions next to the carrier.

*IQ image* are inband emissions symmetrically (with respect to the
carrier) on the other side of the allocated RBs.

*General* are applied to all unallocated RBs.

For each evaluated RB, the minimum requirement is calculated as the
higher of *P~RB\ ~*- 30 dB and the power sum of all limit values
(General, IQ Image or Carrier leakage) that apply.

In specific the following combinations:

\- Power (General)

\- Power (General + Carrier leakage)

\- Power (General + IQ Image)

1 and 2 is expressed in terms of power in one non allocated RB under
test, normalized to the average power of an allocated RB (unit dB).

3 is expressed in terms of power in one non allocated RB, normalized to
the power of all allocated RBs. (unit dBc).

This is the reason for two formulas *Emissions ~relative~*.

Create one set of Y(t,f) per slot according to the timing
"![](./media/image5.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}"

For the non-allocated RBs below the in-band emissions are calculated as
follows

![](./media/image15.wmf){width="4.489583333333333in" height="1.0in"},

where

the upper formula represents the in band emissions below the allocated
frequency block and the lower one the in band emissions above the
allocated frequency block.

![](./media/image16.wmf){width="0.17708333333333334in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} is a set of
![](./media/image17.wmf){width="0.25in" height="0.28125in"} DFT-s-OFDM
symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active within the
measurement period,

![](./media/image18.wmf){width="0.28125in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} is the starting frequency offset between
the allocated RB and the measured non-allocated RB (e.g.
![](./media/image19.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in" height="0.25in"}
for the first upper or
![](./media/image20.wmf){width="0.6458333333333334in" height="0.25in"}
for the first lower adjacent RB),

![](./media/image21.wmf){width="0.28125in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}and
![](./media/image22.wmf){width="0.3020833333333333in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"}are the lower and upper edge of the UL
transmission BW configuration,

![](./media/image23.wmf){width="0.15625in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} and
![](./media/image24.wmf){width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} are the lower and upper edge of the
allocated BW,

![](./media/image25.wmf){width="0.2604166666666667in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"}is the SCS, and

![](./media/image26.wmf){width="0.4479166666666667in"
height="0.21875in"} is the frequency domain signal evaluated for in-band
emissions as defined in the clause E.3.3

The allocated RB power per RB and the total allocated RB power are given
by:

![](./media/image28.wmf){width="3.6458333333333335in"
height="0.6145833333333334in"}

The relative in-band emissions, applicable for General and IQ image, are
given by:

![](./media/image29.png){width="6.6930555555555555in"
height="1.0930555555555554in"}

where

![](./media/image8.wmf){width="0.4375in" height="0.28125in"} is the
number of allocated resource blocks,

and

![](./media/image30.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} is the frequency domain samples for the allocated
bandwidth, as defined in the clause E.3.3.

The relative in-band emissions, applicable for carrier leakage, is given
by:

![](./media/image31.emf){width="5.333333333333333in" height="1.40625in"}

where DCRB is one RB or one pair of RBs, depending whether the DC
carrier is inside an RB or in-between two RBs.

Although an exclusion period may be applicable in the time domain, when
evaluating EVM, the inband emissions measurement interval is defined
over one complete slot in the time domain.

From the acquired samples *n* functions for general in band emissions
and IQ image inband emissions can be derived, where *n* is as defined in
Annex E.2.2. *n* values or *n* pairs of carrier leakage inband emissions
can be derived. They are compared against different limits after the
final averaging:

The in-band emissions are averaged over the *n* samples (equivalent to
10 UL subframes):

E.4.4 EVM equalizer
-------------------

E.4.4.1 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
---------------------------------------

For EVM equalizer spectrum flatness use EC(f) as defined in E.3.3. Note,
EC(f) represents equalizer coefficient ，f is the allocated subcarriers
within the transmission bandwidth ((\|*F*\|=12\*)

From the acquired samples *n* functions EC(f) can be derived, where *n*
is as defined in Annex E.2.2.

EC(f) is broken down to 2 functions:

Where Range 1 and Range 2 are as defined for Clause 6.4.2.4 in Table
6.4.2.4.5-1 for normal condition and Table 6.4.2.4.5-2 for extreme
condition and for Clause 6.4.2.5 as in Table 6.4.2.5.5-1.

The following peak to peak ripple is calculated:

,which denote the maximum ripple in Range 1

,which denote the maximum ripple in Range 2

,which denote the maximum ripple between the upper side of Range 1 and
lower side of Range 2

,which denote the maximum ripple between the upper side of Range 2 and
lower side of Range 1

### E.4.4.2 EVM equalizer spectral shaping filter

The calculation of the impulse response of the spectral shaping filter
is based on EC(f) as defined in E.3.3. Note that EC(f) represents
complex valued equalizer coefficient with ，where f is the allocated
subcarriers within the transmission bandwidth (\|*F*\|=12\*).

EC'(f) is the corrected version of EC(f) by shifting by T~f~. T~f~ is as
defined in Clause E.3.2.

The impulse responses are the IDFT transformed equalizer coefficients:\
, where *f* is the frequency of the *M* allocated subcarriers.

The impulse response is normalized to its first value.

This is equivalent to defining the 0dB as 20*log*~10~│*ã~t~*(0)│.

From the acquired samples, *n* functions can be derived, where *n* is as
defined in Annex E.2.2.

Note, that this method provides reasonable results only in the case of
full allocations.

E.4.5 Frequency error and Carrier leakage
-----------------------------------------

See E.3.1.

E.4.6 EVM of Demodulation reference symbols (EVM~DMRS~)
-------------------------------------------------------

For the purpose of EVM ~DMRS~, the steps E.2.2 to E.4.2 are repeated 6
times, constituting 6 EVM ~DMRS~ sub-periods. The only purpose of the
repetition is to cover the longer gross measurement period of EVM ~DMRS~
(![](./media/image46.png){width="0.3020833333333333in"
height="0.14583333333333334in"} time slots) and to derive the FFT window
timing per sub-period.

The bigger of the EVM results in one *n* TS period corresponding to the
timing¦ --W/2 or +W/2 is compared against the limit, where *n* is as
defined in Annex E.2.2. (Clause E.4.2) This timing is re-used for EVM
~DMRS~ in the equivalent EVM ~DMRS~ sub-period.

For EVM the demodulation reference symbols are excluded, while the data
symbols are used. For EVM~DMRS~ the data symbols are excluded, while the
demodulation references symbols are used. This is illustrated in figure
E.4.6-1

Figure E.4.6-1: EVM~DMRS~ measurement points

Re-use the following formula from E.3.3:

Z'(f,t) = MS(f,t) **^.^** EC(f)

To calculate EVM~DMRS~ , the data symbol (t=0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13) in
Z'(f,t) are excluded and only the reference symbols (t=2,7,11) are used.

The EVM ~DMRS~ is the difference between the ideal waveform and the
measured and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s)

,

where

t covers the count of demodulation reference symbols (i.e. symbols
2,7,11 in each slot, so count=3)

f covers the count of demodulation reference symbols within the
allocated bandwidth. (\|F\|=12\* (with: number of allocated resource
blocks)).

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM ~DMRS~

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

*n* such results are generated per measurement sub-period, where *n* is
as defined in Annex E.2.2.

### E.4.6.1 1^st^ average for EVM ~DMRS~

EVM ~DMRS~ is averaged over all basic EVM ~DMRS~ measurements in one
sub-period

The averaging comprises *n* UL slots

![](./media/image53.png){width="2.6770833333333335in"
height="0.8125in"},

where *n* is as defined in Annex E.2.2.

The timing is taken from the EVM for the data. 6 of those results are
achieved from the samples. In general the timing is not the same for
each result.

E.4.7 Modified signal under test
--------------------------------

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments.

The DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals or PRACH signal under test is modified
and, in the case of DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals, decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

The CP-OFDM modulated signals or PUSCH demodulation reference signal or
PUCCH data signal under test is equalised and, in the case of CP-OFDM
modulated signals decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

To minimize the error, the signal under test should be modified with
respect to a set of parameters following the procedure explained below.

Notation:

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length (defined in the next clauses) or the last sample of the first
window half if is even.

The EVM analyser shall

\- detect the start of each slot and estimate and ,

\- determine so that the EVM window of length is centred

\- on the time interval determined by the measured cyclic prefix minus
16κ samples of the considered OFDM symbol for symbol l for subcarrier
spacing configuration µ in a subframe, with l = 0 or l = 7\*2\^µ for
normal CP, i.e. the first 16κ samples of the CP should not be taken into
account for this step. In the determination of the number of excluded
samples, a sampling rate of 1/T~c~ is assumed. If a different sampling
rate is used, the number of excluded samples is scaled linearly.

\- on the measured cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol for all
other symbols for normal CP and for symbol 0 to 11 for extended CP.

\- on the measured preamble cyclic prefix for the PRACH

To determine the other parameters a sample timing offset equal to is
corrected from the signal under test. The EVM analyser shall then

\- correct the RF frequency offset for each time slot, and

\- apply an FFT of appropriate size. The chosen FFT size shall ensure
that in the case of an ideal signal under test, there is no measured
inter-subcarrier interference.

The carrier leakage shall be removed from the evaluated signal before
calculating the EVM and the in-band emissions; however, the removed
relative carrier leakage power also has to satisfy the applicable
requirement.

At this stage the allocated RBs shall be separated from the
non-allocated RBs. In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH EVM, the signal on the
non-allocated RB(s), , is used to evaluate the in-band emissions.

Moreover, the following procedure applies only to the signal on the
allocated RB(s).

\- In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate
the TX chain equalizer coefficients and used by the ZF equalizer for all
subcarriers by time averaging at each signal subcarrier of the amplitude
and phase of the reference and data symbols. The time-averaging length
is 1 slot. This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
signal subcarrier used by the ZF equalizer. The knowledge of data
modulation symbols may be required in this step because the
determination of symbols by demodulation is not reliable before signal
equalization.

\- In the case of PRACH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate the TX chain
coefficients and used for phase and amplitude correction and are
selected so as to minimize the resulting EVM. The TX chain coefficients
are not dependent on frequency, i.e. and . The TX chain coefficient are
chosen independently for each preamble transmission and for each .

At this stage estimates of , , and are available. is one of the
extremities of the window , i.e. can be or , where if is odd and if is
even. The EVM analyser shall then

\- calculate EVM~l~ with set to ,

\- calculate EVM~h~ with set to .

For the EVM calculation on the symbols with a transient period when the
UE signals a transient period capability (tp) of 2, 4 or 7usec,
$\Delta\widetilde{t}$ is given below.

\- calculate EVM~l\_tp~ with $\Delta\widetilde{t}$ set
to$\left\lfloor \frac{tp + \text{tp}_{\text{start}}}{T_{c}} \right\rfloor + 1$,
where is 1/T~c~ the sampling rate

\- calculate EVM~h\_tp~ with $\Delta\widetilde{t}$ set
to$\left\lfloor \frac{CP + \text{tp}_{\text{start}}}{T_{c}} \right\rfloor - 1$,
where 1/T~c~ is the sampling rate and the CP is the cyclic prefix of the
symbol on which EVM is calculated (e.g. long CP for the first symbol of
the slot) in seconds

A pictorial representation of the EVM measurement windows is given in
Figure F.4-1.

E.4.8 EVM measurement for dual Tx
---------------------------------

For UE with dual transmission antennas, if UE indicates IE
\[*txDiversity-r16*\], EVM is measured at each antenna connector to get
EVM~1~ and EVM~2~, and the total EVM is calculated by values of EVM~1~
and EVM~2~ with weighting factor of linear power at each antenna
connector.

$$\text{EVM} = \frac{P_{1}*\text{EVM}_{1} + P_{2}*\text{EVM}_{2}}{P_{1} + P_{2}}$$

where P~1~ and P~2~ denote the linear power measured at each antenna
connector respectively.

E.4.9 Phase offset measurement for DMRS bundling
------------------------------------------------

### E.4.9.1 Measurement point

The measurement point for phase offset measurement is defined in Figure
F.9.1-1.

Figure E.4.9.1-1: Measurement point for phase offset for DMRS bundling

### E.4.9.2 Symbols used

Phase offset is determined based on DMRS REs (3 DMRS symbols per slot)
with the option to use data symbols.

### E.4.9.3 Modified test signal

Same as described in Annex E.4.7.

### E.4.9.4 Phase offset measurement

The phase offset measurement is based on the phase response of the Tx
chain as derived based on Annex F.4.

The subcarrier at the carrier leakage frequency of the transmitted
signal shall be excluded from the measured subcarriers.

The phase difference
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)\ $for each measured
subcarrier between a reference timeslot t~ref~ and the measurement
timeslot t~m~ is then calculated as defined below.

$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \ \widetilde{\varphi}\left( t_{m},f \right) - \widetilde{\varphi}(t_{\text{ref}},f)$

The phase offset between the reference and measurement timeslots are
then calculated as the maximum over the results for all measured
subcarriers as shown below:

$\text{PhaseOffset} = \max_{f}{(\left| \mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) \right|)}$

E.5 EVM and inband emissions for PUCCH
======================================

For the purpose of worst case testing, the PUCCH shall be located on the
edges of the Transmission Bandwidth Configuration.

The EVM for PUCCH (EVM~PUCCH~) is averaged over *n* slots, where *n* is
as defined in Annex E.2.2.

At least *n* TSs shall be transmitted by the UE without power change.
SRS multiplexing shall be avoided during this period. The following
transition periods are applicable: One OFDM symbol on each side of the
slot border (instant of band edge alternation).

The description below is generic in the sense that all 5 PUCCH formats
are covered. Although the number of OFDM symbols in one slot can be
different from 14 (depending on the format, configuration and cyclic
prefix length), the text below uses 14 without excluding the others.

E.5.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The basic principle is the same as described in E.2.1

E.5.2 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is processed same as described in
E.2.2

E.5.3 Reference signal
----------------------

The reference signal is defined same as in E.2.3. Same as in E.2.3,
i~1~(ν) is the ideal reference for EVM~PUCCH~ and i~2~(ν) is used to
estimate the FFT window timing.

Note PUSCH is off during the PUCCH measurement period.

E.5.4 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results are:

\- EVM~PUCCH~

\- Inband emissions with the sub-results: General in-band emission, IQ
image (according to: 38.101. Annex F.4, Clause starting with: "At this
stage the ....")

E.5.5 Measurement points
------------------------

The measurement points are illustrated in Figure E.2.5-1.

E.5.6 Pre FFT minimization process
----------------------------------

The pre FFT minimisation process is the same as describes in clause
E.3.1.

NOTE: although an exclusion period for EVM~PUCCH~ is applicable in
E.5.9.1, the pre FFT minimisation process is done over the complete
slot.

RF error, and carrier leakage are necessary for best fit of the measured
signal towards the ideal signal in the pre FFT domain. However they are
not used to compare them against the limits.

E.5.7 Timing of the FFT window
------------------------------

Timing of the FFT window is estimated with the same method as described
in E.3.2.

E.5.8 Post FFT equalisation
---------------------------

The post FFT equalisation is described separately without reference to
E.3.3:

Perform 14 FFTs on z'(ν), one for each OFDM symbol in a slot using the
timing , including the demodulation reference symbol. The result is an
array of samples, 14 in the time axis t times 4096 in the frequency axis
f. The samples represent the OFDM symbols (data and reference symbols)
in the allocated RBs and inband emissions in the non-allocated RBs
within the transmission BW.

Only the allocated resource blocks in the frequency domain are used for
equalisation.

The nominal reference symbols and **nominal** OFDM data symbols are used
to equalize the measured data symbols.

Note: (The nomenclature inside this note is local and not valid outside)

The nominal OFDM data symbols are created by a demodulation process. A
demodulation process as follows is recommended:

1\. Equalize the measured OFDM data symbols using the reference symbols
for equalisation. Result: Equalized OFDM data symbols

2\. Decide for the nearest constellation point, however not independent
for each subcarrier in the RB. 12 constellation points are decided
dependent, using the applicable CAZAC sequence. Result: Nominal OFDM
data symbols

At this stage we have an array of [M]{.underline}easured
data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and reference-[S]{.underline}ymbols (MS(f,t))

versus an array of [N]{.underline}ominal data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and
reference [S]{.underline}ymbols (NS(f,t))

The arrays comprise in sum 14 data and reference symbols, depending on
the PUCCH format, in the time axis and the number of allocated
sub-carriers in the frequency axis.

MS(f,t) and NS(f,t) are processed with a least square (LS) estimator, to
derive one equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated
subcarrier. EC(f)

With \* denoting complex conjugation.

EC(f) are used to equalize the OFDM data together with the demodulation
reference symbols by:

Z'(f,t) = MS(f,t) **^.^** EC(f)

With **^.^** denoting multiplication.

Z'(f,t) is used to calculate EVM~PUCCH~, as described in E.5.9 1

NOTE: although an exclusion period for EVM~PUCCH~ is applicable in
E.5.9.1, the post FFT minimisation process is done over 14 OFDM symbols.

The samples of the non-allocated resource blocks within the transmission
bandwidth configuration in the post FFT domain are called Y(f,t) (f
covering the non-allocated subcarriers within the transmission bandwidth
configuration, t covering the OFDM symbols during 1 slot).

E.5.9 Derivation of the results
-------------------------------

### E.5.9.1 EVM~PUCCH~

For EVM~PUCCH~ create two sets of Z'(f,t)., according to the timing "
--W/2 and +W/2" using the equalizer coefficients from E.5.8

The EVM~PUCCH~ is the difference between the ideal waveform and the
measured and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s)

,

where

the OFDM symbols next to transition boarders (instant of PUCCH frequency
hopping) are excluded:

t covers less than the count of demodulated symbols in the slot (\|T\|=
12)

f covers the count of subcarriers within the allocated bandwidth.
(\|F\|=12)

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM~PUCCH~

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

From the acquired samples 2*n* EVM~PUCCH~ value can be derived, *n*
values for the timing --W/2 and *n* values for the timing +W/2, where
*n* is as defined in Annex E.2.2.

### E.5.9.2 Averaged EVM~PUCCH~

EVM~PUCCH~ is averaged over all basic EVM~PUCCH~ measurements

The averaging comprises *n* UL slots

![](./media/image82.png){width="2.6979166666666665in"
height="0.8333333333333334in"},

where *n* is as defined in Annex E.2.2.

The averaging is done separately for timing¦ --W/2 and +W/2 leading to
and

is compared against the test requirements.

### E.5.9.3 In-band emissions measurement

The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the
non-allocated resources blocks

Create one set of Y(t,f) per slot according to the timing ""

For the non-allocated RBs the in-band emissions are calculated as
follows

,

where

the upper formula represents the inband emissions below the allocated
frequency block and the lower one the inband emissions above the
allocated frequency block.

is a set of OFDM symbols in the measurement period,

is the starting frequency offset between the allocated RB and the
measured non-allocated RB (e.g. for the first upper or for the first
lower adjacent RB),

and are the lower and upper edge of the UL UE channel bandwidth

and are the lower and upper edge of the allocated BW,

is the SCS, and

is the frequency domain signal evaluated for in-band emissions as
defined in the clause E.5.8.

The relative in-band emissions are, given by

where

is the number of allocated RBs,

and is the frequency domain samples for the allocated bandwidth, as
defined in the subsection E.5.8

Although an exclusion period for EVM is applicable in E.5.9.1, the
inband emissions measurement interval is defined over one complete slot
in the time domain.

From the acquired samples *n* functions for inband emissions can be
derived, where *n* is as defined in Annex E.2.2.

The in-band emissions are averaged over the *n* samples (equivalent to
10 UL subframes) with the same PUCCH position to prevent averaging of
allocated and non-allocated RBs due to PUCCH frequency hopping:

Since the PUCCH allocation is always on the upper or lower band-edge,
the opposite of the allocated one represents the IQ image, and the
remaining inner RBs represent the general inband emissions. They are
compared against different limits.

### E.5.9.4 EVM measurement for dual Tx

For UE with dual transmission antennas, if UE indicates IE
\[*txDiversity-r16*\], EVM is measured at each antenna connector to get
EVM~1~ and EVM~2~, and the total EVM is calculated by values of EVM~1~
and EVM~2~ with weighting factor of linear power at each antenna
connector.

$$\text{EVM} = \frac{P_{1}*\text{EVM}_{1} + P_{2}*\text{EVM}_{2}}{P_{1} + P_{2}}$$

where P~1~ and P~2~ denote the linear power measured at each antenna
connector respectively.

E.6 EVM for PRACH
=================

The description below is generic in the sense that all PRACH formats are
covered. The numbers, used in the text below are taken from PRACH
format\#0 without excluding the other formats. The sampling rate for
PRACH is assumed as , 30.72 Msps in the time domain.

E.6.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The basic principle is the same as described in E.2.1

E.6.2 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is processed same as described in
E.2.2

The measurement period is different since 2 PRACH preambles are recorded
for long preamble formats as defined in Table 6.3.3.1-1 in \[8\] and 10
preambles are recorded for short preamble formats as defined in Table
6.3.3.1-2 in \[8\].

E.6.3 Reference signal
----------------------

The test description in 6.4.2.1.4.1 is based on non-contention based
access:

\- PRACH configuration index (responsible for Preamble format, System
frame number and subframe number)

\- Preamble ID

\- Preamble power

signalled to the UE, defines the reference signal unambiguously, such
that no demodulation process is necessary to gain the reference signal.

The reference signal i(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following
parameters: the applicable Zadoff Chu sequence, nominal carrier
frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier, nominal
timing, no carrier leakage. It is represented as a sequence of samples
at a sampling rate of 122.88 Msps in the time domain.

E.6.4 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement result is:

\- EVMPRACH

E.6.5 Measurement points
------------------------

The measurement points are illustrated in the figure below:

![](./media/image101.png){width="6.302083333333333in"
height="1.9479166666666667in"}

Figure E.6.5-1:Measurement points

E.6.6 Pre FFT minimization process
----------------------------------

The pre-FFT minimization process is applied to each PRACH preamble
separately. The time period for the pre- FFT minimisation process
includes the complete CP and Zadoff-Chu sequence (in other words, the
power transition period is per definition outside of this time period)
Sample timing, Carrier frequency and carrier leakage in z(ν) are jointly
varied in order to minimise the difference between z(ν) and i(ν). Best
fit (minimum difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value
between z(ν) and i(ν) is an absolute minimum.

After this process the samples z(ν) are called z^0^(ν).

RF error, and carrier leakage are necessary for best fit of the measured
signal towards the ideal signal in the pre FFT domain. However they are
not used to compare them against the limits.

E.6.7 Timing of the FFT window
------------------------------

The FFT window length is 24576 samples for preamble format 0, however in
the measurement period at least 27744 samples are taken. The position in
time for FFT must be determined.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window W\<CP.

The reference instant for the FFT start is the centre of the reduced
window, called ,

EVM is measured at the following two instants: --W/2 and +W/2.

The timing of the measured signal z^0^(ν) with respect to the ideal
signal i(ν) is determined in the pre FFT domain as follows:

Correlation between z^0^(ν) and i(ν) will result in a correlation peak.
The meaning of the correlation peak is approx. the "impulse response" of
the TX filter. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more
than one, the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal with
respect to the ideal signal.

W is different for different preamble formats and shown in Table E.6.7-1
for and in Table E.6.7-2 for and where.

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to z^0^(ν). This
subset of samples is called z' (ν).

EVM is based on Nominal FFT size samples per PRACH preamble and
demodulated symbol.

E.6.8 Post FFT equalisation
---------------------------

Equalisation is not applicable for the PRACH.

E.6.9 Derivation of the results
-------------------------------

### E.6.9.1 EVM~PRACH~

Perform FFT on z'(ν) and i(ν) using the FFT timing --W/2 and +W/2.

For format 2 and 3 the first and the repeated preamble sequence are
FFT-converted separately. using the standard FFT length of 2048.

The EVM~PRACH~ is the difference between the ideal waveform and the
measured and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s).

,

where

t covers the count of demodulated symbols in the slot.

f covers the count of demodulated symbols within the allocated
bandwidth.

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM~PRACH~

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

From the acquired samples 2*m* EVM~PRACH~ values can be derived, *m*
values for the timing --W/2 and *m* values for the timing +W/2, where
*m* is the number of recorded preambles as defined in Annex E.6.2.

### E.6.9.2 Averaged EVM~PRACH~

The PRACH EVM, , is averaged over *m* preamble sequence measurements.

,

where *m* is the number of recorded preambles as defined in Annex
E.6.2.The averaging is done separately for timing¦ --W/2 and +W/2
leading to and

is compared against the test requirements.

### E.6.9.3 EVM measurement for dual Tx

For UE with dual transmission antennas, if UE indicates IE
\[*txDiversity-r16*\], EVM is measured at each antenna connector to get
EVM~1~ and EVM~2~, and the total EVM is calculated by values of EVM~1~
and EVM~2~ with weighting factor of linear power at each antenna
connector.

$$\text{EVM} = \frac{P_{1}*\text{EVM}_{1} + P_{2}*\text{EVM}_{2}}{P_{1} + P_{2}}$$

where P~1~ and P~2~ denote the linear power measured at each antenna
connector respectively.

E.8 EVM for UL MIMO
===================

E.8.1 General
-------------

EVM for UL MIMO is measured per layer. A zero-forcing (ZF) MIMO receiver
architecture is used so that dual layer transmissions by the UE can be
demodulated by the test equipment receiver.

Figure E.8.1-1: EVM calculation block diagram for 2-Layer UL MIMO

The TE receives signals from 2 different ports which are connected to
two antenna connectors in the test system.

For UL MIMO measurements a MIMO equalization step as described in
section E.8.2 is performed to separate the layers.

Each layer is then processed as described in section E.8.3 to receive
the measurement results for each individual layer.

E.8.2 MIMO Equalization
-----------------------

The MIMO equalization is based only on reference signals (DMRS) without
using any data symbols. For the equalization process all available DMRS
symbols shall be used.

The effective 2x2 channel matrix is estimated using reference signals of
different subcarriers, e.g. in case of DMRS antenna ports 0 and 2. In
case that same subcarriers are used, e.g. DMRS antenna ports 0 and 1, a
channel decomposition is necessary taking advantage of the orthogonal
codes *w~f~* and *w~t~* and assuming identical channel coefficients for
adjacent subcarriers of same CDM group.

Effective channel including the precoding matrix *P* is:

$$\widetilde{H} = \text{HP} = \ \begin{bmatrix}
{\widetilde{h}}_{0,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{0,1} \\
{\widetilde{h}}_{1,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{1,1} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

with

$${\widetilde{h}}_{n,\nu} = \frac{y_{n}r_{\nu}^{*}}{{|r_{\nu}|}^{2}}$$

where *y* denotes the received symbol on port index *n* and *r* the
reference signal for layer index *ν*.

Since reference signals of a specific layer are transmitted only on
subcarriers of one CDM group channel, interpolation is needed in order
to obtain channel coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel
interpolation is done using the channel coefficients of active CDM group
in all other CDM groups.

The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients
are obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing
the moving average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving
average window size is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of
allocation the window size is reduced accordingly.

The ZF equalizer coefficients are calculated as the inverse of the
effective channel matrix, in general:

$$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{- 1}$$

E.8.3 Layer processing
----------------------

After performing the MIMO equalization as described in section E.8.2
each layer is processed using the existing procedure as defined in Annex
E.

Since the channel estimation is calculated only on the DMRS symbols, an
averaging including all 14 symbols of one slot, i.e. data and reference
signals, is needed in order to minimize EVM. The averaging is achieved
by the least square (LS) equalization method described for single layer
in Annex E.3.

*MS(f,t)* and *NS(f,t)* are processed with a LS estimator, to derive one
equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated subcarrier.
*EC(f)* is defined for each layer as:

$$\text{EC}_{\nu}(f) = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{13}{\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)^{*}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{13}{MS_{\nu}(f,t)^{*}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}$$

With \* denoting complex conjugation. *EC(f)* are used to equalize layer
data symbols.

EVM equalizer spectral flatness is derived from equalizer coefficients
for each layer as follows:

$$c_{\nu} = \left| \text{EC}_{\nu}(f) \right|\ \sqrt{\left| g_{\nu,0} \right|^{2} + \left| g_{\nu,1} \right|^{2}}$$

E.9 EVM for V2X
===============

E.9.1 EVM for PSSCH and PSCCH
-----------------------------

The calculation of the EVM for PSSCH and PSCCH follows the procedure
defined in Annex E.4. The EVM is calculated separately for PSSCH and
PSCCH using separate equalizer, while the in-band emission is calculated
only once.

The measurement period for EVM of PSSCH and PSCCH is 10 subframes. When
sidelink transmissions are shortened due to transmission gap of one
symbol at the end of each slot, the EVM measurement interval is reduced
by one symbol, accordingly.

######## Annex F (normative): Measurement uncertainties and Test Tolerances

F.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System (normative)
=====================================================

F.1.0 General
-------------

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
range, and the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty
not exceeding the specified values. All ranges and uncertainties are
absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless
otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause F.1
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

The downlink signal uncertainties apply at each receiver antenna
connector.

F.1.1 Measurement of test environments
--------------------------------------

The measurement accuracy of the UE test environments defined in TS
38.508-1 \[5\] subclause 4.1, Test environments shall be

\- Pressure ±5 kPa.

\- Temperature ±2 degrees.

\- Relative Humidity ±5 %.

\- DC Voltage ±1,0 %.

\- AC Voltage ±1,5 %.

\- Vibration 10 %.

\- Vibration frequency 0,1 Hz.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

F.1.2 Measurement of transmitter
--------------------------------

\- MU and TT for \>6GHz (band n96) are working assumption based on
analysis of single TE vendor. Values will be revisited once analysis
from other TE vendors is available.

\- MU and TT for spurious emission for intra-band UL contiguous CA with
UL-MIMO test cases are working assumption. Values will be revisited once
more analysis is available.

F.2 Interpretation of measurement results (normative)
=====================================================

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared --
without any modification -- against the Test Requirements. The Test
Requirement is defined as a threshold considered in a test to assess
compliance of the device; it might be either equal ("Shared Risk"
principle) or relaxed ("Never fail a good DUT" principle) compared to
the corresponding core specification value by an amount defined in Annex
F.3 as Test Tolerance.

The "Shared Risk" and the "Never fail a good DUT" principles are defined
in Rec. ITU-R M.1545.

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in clause F.1
of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause F.1, it is still permitted to use
this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made value as follows:

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause F.1 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests, for example receiver
tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure
will ensure that a Test System not compliant with clause F.1does not
increase the chance of passing a device under test where that device
would otherwise have failed the test if a Test System compliant with
clause F.1 had been used.

F.3 Test Tolerance and Derivation of Test Requirements (informative)
====================================================================

The Test Requirements in the present document have been calculated by
relaxing the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the
Test Tolerances defined in this clause. When the Test Tolerance is zero,
the Test Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When
the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ from
the Minimum Requirements, and the formula used for the relaxation is
given in this clause.

The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the Test Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.

The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable
loss, etc.).

The downlink Test Tolerances apply at each receiver antenna connector.

F.3.1 Measurement of test environments
--------------------------------------

The UE test environments are set to the values defined in TS 38.508-1
subclause 4.1, without any relaxation. The applied Test Tolerance is
therefore zero.

F.3.2 Measurement of transmitter
--------------------------------

\- MU and TT for \>6GHz (band n96) are working assumption based on
analysis of single TE vendor. Values will be revisited once analysis
from other TE vendors is available.

F.4 Uplink power window
=======================

F.4.1 Introduction
------------------

A number of Tx and Rx Test cases set the UE uplink power to be within a
defined window to ensure the test is carried out in the intended
conditions. This clause gives the method for calculating the uplink
power window used in Tx test cases and Rx Test cases.

F.4.2 Setting the power window above a requirement
--------------------------------------------------

### F.4.2.1 NR FR1

The method used to derive the uplink power window is defined in TS
38.521-3 \[14\] clause F.4.2.1.

F.4.3 Setting the power window below a requirement
--------------------------------------------------

### F.4.3.1 NR FR1

The method used to derive the uplink power window is defined in TS
38.521-3 \[14\] clause F.4.3.1.

F.4.4 Setting the power window centred on a target value
--------------------------------------------------------

### F.4.4.1 NR FR1

The method used to derive the uplink power window is defined in TS
38.521-3 \[14\] clause F.4.4.1.

######## Annex G (normative): Uplink Physical Channels

G.0 Uplink Signal Levels
========================

Uplink signal power is a UE figure, which is configured by the Test
System by means of:

RRC messages (IE-s), such as:

\- PUSCH-PowerControl

\- PUCCH-PowerControl

\- RACH-ConfigGeneric

\- SRS-Config

and L1/2 Power control commands (TPC).

The uplink power settings are specified in the test case.

Otherwise, the uplink power settings result from the default RRC
messages described in TS 38.508 \[5\], and appropriate TPC-s, which are
sent to the UE to transmit with an UL power level necessary for
maintaining the call during the test.

G.1 General
===========

This annex specifies the uplink physical channels that are needed for
setting a connection and channels that are needed during a connection.
Table G.1-1 describes the mapping of uplink physical channels and
signals to physical resources

######## Annex H (normative): Statistical Testing

H.1 General
===========

This annex specifies mapping throughput to error ratio, pass fail limits
and pass fail decision rules that are needed for measuring average
throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance
for testing receiver characteristics.

H.2 Statistical testing of receiver characteristics
===================================================

H.2.1 General
-------------

The test of receiver characteristics is twofold.

1\. A signal or a combination of signals is offered to the RX port(s) of
the receiver.

2\. The ability of the receiver to demodulate /decode this signal is
verified by measuring the throughput.

In (2) is the statistical aspect of the test and is treated here.

The minimum requirement for all receiver tests is \>95% of the maximum
throughput.

All receiver tests are performed in static propagation conditions. No
fading conditions are applied.

H.2.2 Mapping throughput to error ratio
---------------------------------------

a\) The measured information bit throughput R is defined as the sum (in
kilobits) of the information bit payloads successfully received during
the test interval, divided by the duration of the test interval (in
seconds).

b\) In measurement practice the UE indicates successfully received
information bit payload by signalling an ACK to the SS.\
If payload is received, but damaged and cannot be decoded, the UE
signals a NACK.

c\) Only the ACK and NACK signals, not the data bits received, are
accessible to the SS.\
The number of bits is known in the SS from knowledge of what payload was
sent.

d\) For the reference measurement channel, applied for testing, the
number of bits is different in different slots, however in a radio frame
it is fixed during one test.

e\) The time in the measurement interval is composed of successfully
received slots (ACK), unsuccessfully received slots (NACK) and no
reception at all (DTX-slots).

f\) DTX-slots may occur regularly according the applicable reference
measurement channel (regDTX).\
In real live networks this is the time when other UEs are served. In TDD
these are the UL and special slots.\
regDTX vary from test to test but are fixed within the test.

g\) Additional DTX-slots occur statistically when the UE is not
responding ACK or NACK where it should. (statDTX)\
This may happen when the UE was not expecting data or decided that the
data were not intended for it.

The pass / fail decision is done by observing the:

\- number of NACKs

\- number of ACKs and

\- number of statDTXs (regDTX is implicitly known to the SS)

The ratio (NACK + statDTX)/(NACK+ statDTX + ACK)is the Error Ratio (ER).
Taking into account the time consumed by the ACK, NACK, and DTX-TTIs
(regular and statistical), ER can be mapped unambiguously to throughput
for any single reference measurement channel test.

H.2.3 Design of the test
------------------------

The test is defined by the following design principles (see clause
H.2.6, Theory....):

1\. The early decision concept is applied.

2\. A second limit is introduced: Bad DUT factor M\>1

3\. To decide the test pass:

Supplier risk is applied based on the Bad DUT quality

To decide the test fail

Customer Risk is applied based on the specified DUT quality

The test is defined by the following parameters:

1\. Limit ER = 0.05 (Throughput limit = 95%)

2\. Bad DUT factor M=1.5 (selectivity)

3\. Confidence level CL = 95% (for specified DUT and Bad DUT-quality)

H.2.5 Pass fail decision rules
------------------------------

The pass fail decision rules apply for a single measurement. A test case
is passed only when all the measurements in the test case are passed.

Having observed 0 errors, pass the test at 67+ samples, otherwise
continue

Having observed 1 error, pass the test at 67+ samples, otherwise
continue

Having observed 2 errors, pass the test at 95+ samples, otherwise
continue

Etc. etc.

Having observed 145 errors, pass the test at 2349+ samples, fail the
test at 2345- samples, otherwise continue

Having observed 146 errors, pass the test at 2364 + samples, fail the
test at 2363- samples.

Where x+ means: x or more, x- means x or less

NOTE 1: an ideal DUT passes after 67 samples. The maximum test time is
2364 samples.

NOTE 2: It is allowed to deviate from the early decision concept by
postponing the decision (pass/fail or continue). Postponing the decision
to or beyond the end of Table H.2.4-1 requires a pass fail decision
against the test limit: pass the DUT for ER\<0.0618, otherwise fail.

H.2.6 Theory to derive the pass fail limits (Informative)
---------------------------------------------------------

Editor\'s note: This clause of the Annex H is for information only and
it describes the background theory and information for statistical
testing.

### H.2.6.1 Numerical definition of the pass-fail limits

A statistical test is characterized by test time, selectivity and
confidence level. The outcome of the statistical test is a decision.
This decision may be correct, i.e., DUTs whose throughput is less than
95% maximum throughput being declared to fail, and DUTs whose throughput
is higher or equal to 95% being declared to pass, or in-correct with
opposite decision. The Confidence Level (CL) describes the probability
that the decision is a correct one. The complement is the wrong decision
probability (risk) D = 1-CL.

As described in H.2.2, the measurement of throughput could be mapped to
ER (Error Ratio). When testing ER, transport blocks or \"samples\" are
observed and the number of correctly and erroneously received blocks are
recorded. For a \"standard\" test, a pre-defined number of samples are
observed, and a pass/fail decision is made based on the number of
observed errors being above/below a threshold. This threshold is based
on the targeted throughput or BLER and the design target CL. There is
always some risk of a statistical variation leading to an incorrect
pass/fail decision. The greater the number of samples that are recorded,
the lower is the risk of such an error. The number of samples that are
observed in a standard test is dimensioned to achieve an acceptable low
risk of error (i.e., an acceptable high confidence level) for DUTs that
just meet the specified limit.

The standard test works well where the target ER level is relatively
high and confidence level relatively low (both are chosen to be on a
comparable order of magnitude). However, for relatively low ER testing
the length of time required for observing sufficient samples to achieve
a 95% confidence level is excessive. In many cases, the DUTs will in
fact have a much lower true ER level than the target ER level, (in which
case, the number of samples needed to achieve high confidence that the
true ER level is lower than the limit is much smaller). On the other
hand, a bad DUT which is expected to fail the requirement might have a
much higher true ER level (in which case, errors occur more frequently
and it can be demonstrated that the DUT is above the target ER limit
with fewer samples).

To avoid long test time, an alternative test method called early
pass/fail is adopted. With the early pass/fail, each time a block error
is encountered, a decision is made on whether the DUT can be
passed/failed with 95% CL or the test needs to continue until another
error is encountered. In the case of very good DUTs, the test can also
be passed, when the number of samples permissible for one error event is
reached and no error event is recorded. Pass/Fail is decided based on
the total number of observed samples and errors, and a statistical
calculation based on an inverse binomial cumulative distribution. The
calculation involves one parameter, one variable and the result:

\- Parameter: d (per step decision probability).

\- Variable: ne (number of observed errors).

\- Result: ns (number of expected samples for pass/fail, depending on
which one is calculated).

The per step decision probability risk, d, expresses the probability of
making an incorrect pass/fail decision in the current step (i.e., for
the current decision coordinate). d is determined by simulation such
that the overall risk of making a wrong decision over all steps of each
test of a large number of tests on a large number of DUTs that exactly
meet the target ER limit is D=5% (and hence the CL 95%).

It should be noted that d is determined separately considering early
pass and early fail testing.

For a marginal DUT (i.e., a DUT almost exactly meeting the target ER
level), the unmodified early pass/early fail approach is unable to
distinguish whether the DUT has just passed or just failed the BLER
(ε→0), and can thus terminate with an \"undecided\" result. To avoid
this undecided result and provide selectivity, a so-called \"bad device
factor\" (M) is introduced into the early pass calculation. This factor
biases the decision towards avoiding failing good DUT.

### H.2.6.2 Simulation to derive the pass-fail limits for testing 95% throughput

As per the description in H.2.2, the 95% throughput measurement is
mapped to ER=0.05, where ER is (NACK + statDTX)/(NACK+ statDTX + ACK).

The binomial distribution and its inverse are used to design the pass
and fail limits. Note that this method is not unique and that other
methods exist.

Where

\- fail(..) is the error ratio for the fail limit.

\- pass(..) is the error ratio for the pass limit.

\- ER is the specified error ratio 5%.

\- ne is the number of bad results. This is the variable in both
equations.

\- M is the Bad DUT factor M=1.5.

\- d~f~ is the wrong decision probability of a single (ne, ns)
co-ordinate for the fail limit.\
It is found by simulation to be d~f~ = 0.006.

\- cl~p~ is the confidence level of a single (ne, ns) co-ordinate for
the pass limit.\
It is found by simulation to be cl~p~ = 0.9945.

\- qnbinom(..): The inverse cumulative function of the negative binomial
distribution.

The simulation works as follows:

\- A large population of limit DUTs with true ER = 0.05 is decided
against the pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (95 %) of the population passes
and D (5 %) of the population fails.

\- A population of Bad DUTs with true ER = M\*0.05 is decided against
the same pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (95 %) of the population fails
and D (5 %) of the population passes.

\- The number of DUTs decrease during the simulation, as the decided
DUTs leave the population. That number decreases with an approximately
exponential characteristics. After 146 bad results all DUTs of the
population are decided.

NOTE: The exponential decrease of the population is an optimal design
goal for the decision co-ordinates (ne, ns), which can be achieved with
other formulas or methods as well.

H.2A Statistical testing of receiver characteristics with CA
============================================================

H.2A.1 General
--------------

H.2.1 applies.

H.2A.2 Mapping throughput to error ratio
----------------------------------------

H.2.2 applies for each component carrier.

H.2A.3 Design of the test
-------------------------

The test is defined by the following design principles (see
clause H.2.6, Theory....):

1\. The standard concept is applied. (not the early decision concept).

2\. A second limit is introduced, defining the Bad DUT.

3\. To decide the test pass:

\- Supplier risk is applied based on the Bad DUT quality.

\- To decide the test fail.

\- Customer Risk is applied based on the specified DUT quality.

The test is defined by the following parameters:

1\) Limit Error Ratio = 0.05 (95% throughput is tested).

2\) Bad DUT factor M=1.5 (selectivity).

3\) Confidence level CL = 95% (for specified DUT and Bad DUT-quality).

H.2A.4 Pass fail decision rules
-------------------------------

Apply 1003 samples to the DUT per CC.

Decide pass per CC in case of ≤ 62 errors, otherwise fail.

NOTE 1: The pass fail decision is done individually for each CC. The
pass fail decision for one measurement is as follows: pass if all CCs or
SCC only according to the test cases pass, otherwise fail. A test case
is passed only when all the measurements in the test case are passed.

NOTE 2: It is allowed to apply more samples to the DUT, common for all
CCs, (e.g. up to an integer number of frames). Use the ratio (62/1003)
for the pass fail decision.

NOTE 3: 62/1003 = 0.0618, the same test limit is used at the end of
Table H.2.4-1.

######## Annex J (normative):

Difference of relative phase and power errors

J.0 General
===========

This annex gives further information needed for understanding and
implementing 6.4D.4. The following terms should be understood as
follows:

\- Relative phase error: refers to the phase difference between signals
at different antenna connectors, which should be ideally 0. It should be
understood as for a slot i.e. (slot) relative phase. It is calculated
based on DMRS symbols of that slot or on SRS symbols.

\- Difference of relative phase error: refers to the difference between
the relative phase error determined per slot and the relative phase
error determined based on the SRS transmitted.

J.1 Measurement Point
=====================

Figure J.1-1 shows the measurement point for the difference of relative
phase and power errors.

Figure J.1-1 - Measurement point for difference of relative phase/power
error for UL coherent MIMO

J.2 Relative Phase Error Measurement
====================================

Here are listed the different aspects that may lead to different
interpretations.

J.2.1 Symbols and subcarriers used
----------------------------------

Phase error is determined based on DMRS REs (DMRS mapping type A with 3
DMRS symbols per slot, the REs corresponding to the odd subcarriers and
DMRS symbols are non-allocated for data or DMRS.) and SRS REs (with 4
SRS symbols in the SRS slot, same SRS resource mapping is used for
non-codebook-based and codebook-based precoding).

For the DMRS and SRS to occupy identical SCs and maximize their
frequency density, DMRS configuration type 1 and SRS comb2 configuration
are used.

UL RMC described in Annex A.2 is used.

J.2.2 CFO (carrier frequency offset) correction
-----------------------------------------------

The TE performs a CFO correction on a slot-by-slot basis using a common
frequency correction at the two uplink antenna connectors.

J.2.3 Steps of the measurement method
-------------------------------------

Below are detailed the steps necessary to obtain the maximum difference
of relative phase error during the 20ms time window.

1\. Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna, the SRS
relative phase error based on the last SRS transmitted on Ant1 and Ant2,
that relative phase error serves as a reference for the calculation of
the difference of relative phase error for each slot inside the 20 ms
time window.

\- The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.

2\. Calculation for the last SRS transmitted, for each RB of the SRS
relative phase errors based on the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier SRS
relative phase errors determined in previous step.

\- The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted: $\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

3\. CFO correction on slot-by-slot basis using a common frequency
correction for both antenna outputs.

4\. Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna, the phase
over the slot being analyzed. The phase is extracted from the channel
estimate derived from the 3 DMRS symbols of the slot using the LSE
technique.

\- The output is one vector of dimension
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$ for each
antenna.

5\. Calculation for a slot for each subcarrier of the relative phase
error (difference between the vectors determined in the previous step).

\- The output is subcarrier relative phase errors of a slot:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.

6\. Calculation for a slot, for each RB of the relative phase errors
based on the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier relative phase errors
determined in previous step.

\- The output is a "slot relative phase error" vector for a
slot:$\ \left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

7\. Calculation for a slot of the difference of relative phase errors
based on the "SRS relative phase error" (reference) determined in step 2
and the "slot relative phase error" determined in previous step.

\- The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector for a
slot:$\ \left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

8\. Calculation for a slot of the arithmetic mean value of the
"difference of relative phase error" vector determined in previous step;
this value corresponds to an RB.

\- The output is a "difference of relative phase error" value for a
slot: $\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack.$

9\. Perform for each slot of the 20ms time window, steps 3 to 8.

\- The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ slots \right\rbrack$.

10\. Calculation of the maximum value of the "difference of relative
phase error".

\- The output is the "difference of relative phase error" that should be
verified as complying with the 40° maximum allowable difference of
relative phase error requirement:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack$.
