6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
--------------------------------

Unwanted emissions are divided into \"Out-of-band emission\" and
\"Spurious emissions\" in 3GPP RF specifications. This notation is in
line with ITU-R recommendations such as SM.329 ‎‎\[7\] and the Radio
Regulations ‎\[TBD\].

ITU defines:

Out-of-band emission = Emission on a frequency or frequencies
immediately outside the necessary bandwidth which results from the
modulation process, but excluding spurious emissions.

Spurious emission = Emission on a frequency, or frequencies, which are
outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which may be reduced
without affecting the corresponding transmission of information.
Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but exclude
out-of-band emissions.

Unwanted emissions = Consist of spurious emissions and out-of-band
emissions.

The UE transmitter spectrum emission consists of the three components;
the occupied bandwidth (channel bandwidth), the Out Of Band (OOB)
emissions and the far out spurious emission domain.

##### 6.5.1.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose .H6}

To verify that the UE occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations supported by the UE are less than their specific limits

##### 6.5.1.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability .H6}

This test applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward.

##### 6.5.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

Occupied bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth containing 99 % of the
total integrated mean power of the transmitted spectrum on the assigned
channel. The occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations (Resources Blocks) shall be less than the channel
bandwidth specified in Table 6.5.1.3-1.

The occupied bandwidth is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of OBW
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

##### 6.5.1.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure .H6}

1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5.1.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

2\. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(Note 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200 ms for the
UE to reach maximum output power. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (Note 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

4\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

5\. Measure the EIRP spectrum distribution within N -times or more
frequency range over the requirement for Occupied Bandwidth
specification centring on the current carrier frequency. The
characteristics of the filter shall be approximately Gaussian (typical
spectrum analyser filter). The measuring duration is one active uplink
subframe. EIRP is captured from both polarizations, theta and phi. The
ratio of measured bandwidth to channel bandwidth N is specified in Table
6.5.1.4.2-1.

+------------------+------------------------------------------------+-----+-----+-----+

6\. Calculate the total EIRP from both polarizations, theta and phi,
within the range of all frequencies measured in step 5 and save this
value as \"Total EIRP\". EIRP measurement procedure is defined in Annex
K.

7\. Identify the measurement window whose centre is aligned on the
centre of the channel for which the sum of the power measured in theta
and phi polarization is 99% of the "Total EIRP".

### 6.5.2 Out of band emission

The Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
assigned channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission
mask and an Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio. Additional
requirements to protect specific bands are also considered.

The requirements in clause 6.5.2.1 only apply when both UL and DL of a
UE are configured for single CC operation, and they are of the same
bandwidth. For a UE that is configured for single CC operation with
different channel bandwidths in UL and DL, the requirements in clause
6.5A.2.1 apply.

All out of band emissions for range 2 are TRP.

#### 6.5.2.1 Spectrum Emission Mask

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power
    class other than PC1 FR2a, PC3, PC5 and PC6.

##### 6.5.2.1.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-1 .H6}

To verify that the power of any UE emission shall not exceed specified
lever for the specified channel bandwidth.

##### 6.5.2.1.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-1 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward.

##### 6.5.2.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-1 .H6}

The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~)
starting from the ± edge of the assigned NR channel bandwidth. For
frequencies offset greater than F~OOB~ as specified in Table 6.5.2.1.3-1
the spurious requirements in clause 6.5.3 are applicable.

The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in
Table 6.5.2.1.3-1 for the specified channel bandwidth. The requirement
is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX
beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.1 for TE diagram and clause A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.5.2.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5.2.1.4.3

##### 6.5.2.1.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-1 .H6}

1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5.2.1.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

2\. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200 ms for the
UE to reach maximum output power. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

4\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

5\. Measure the TRP of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter
of bandwidths according to Table 6.5.2.1.5-1 and using a rms detector.
If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace mode shall be average.
The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in continuous steps
according to the same table. TRP shall be recorded for each step. The
measurement period shall capture the active time slots. Total radiated
power is measured according to TRP measurement procedure defined in
Annex K. The measurement grid used for TRP measurement defined in Annex
M. TRP is calculated considering both polarizations, theta and phi.

NOTE 1: When switching to DFT-s-OFDM waveform, as specified in Table
6.5.2.1.4.1-1, send an NR RRCReconfiguration message according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.6.3 Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition.

NOTE 2: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

##### 6.5.2.1.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-1 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6.

##### 6.5.2.1.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-1 .H6}

The measured TRP of any UE emission derived in step 5, shall fulfil
requirements in Table.6.5.2.1.5-1.

NOTE: As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward.

##### 6.5.2.3.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-3 .H6}

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. ACLR requirement is
specified for a scenario in which adjacent carrier is another NR
channel.

NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal
channel spacing. The assigned NR channel power and adjacent NR channel
power are measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths
specified in Table 6.5.2.3.3-1.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than --35 dBm then the
NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5.2.3.3-1.
The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of
TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

##### 6.5.2.3.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-3 .H6}

1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5.2.3.4.1-1 and Table 6.5.2.3.4.1-2. Since the UL has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the
UL RMC.

2\. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200 ms for the
UE to reach maximum output power. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

4\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

5\. Measure EIRP of the transmitted signal in the Tx beam peak direction
for the assigned NR channel with a rectangular measurement filter with
bandwidths according to Table 6.5.2.3.5-1 and using a rms detector. If
the sweep count is higher than one, the trace mode shall be average.
EIRP measurement procedure defined in Annex K. EIRP is calculated
considering both polarizations, theta and phi.

6\. Measure EIRP of the first NR adjacent channel on both lower and
upper side of the assigned NR channel, respectively using a rectangular
measurement filter with bandwidths according to Table 6.5.2.3.5-1 and
using a rms detector. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace
mode shall be average. EIRP measurement procedure defined in Annex K.
EIRP is calculated considering both polarizations, theta and phi.

7\. Calculate the ratios of the power between the values measured in
step 5 over step 6 for lower and upper NR ACLR, respectively.

NOTE 1: When switching to DFT-s-OFDM waveform, as specified in the Table
6.5.2.3.4.1-1 and Table 6.5.2.3.4.1-2, send an NR RRCReconfiguration
message according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.6.3 Table 4.6.3-118
PUSCH-Config with TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition.

NOTE 2: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

### 6.5.3 Spurious emissions

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions. The spurious emission limits are specified in
terms of general requirements in line with SM.329 \[7\] and *NR*
operating band requirement to address UE co-existence. Spurious
emissions are measured as TRP.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 6.5.3.1 Transmitter Spurious emissions

Editor's Note: This clause is complete for Band n257, n258, n259, n260
and n261 and for PC1, PC3, PC5, PC6. The following aspects of the clause
are for future consideration:

\- TRP Measurement uncertainty is TBD for above 87 GHz.

\- Test procedure is FFS for laptop.

##### 6.5.3.1.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-4 .H6}

To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference
to other channels or other systems in terms of transmitter spurious
emissions.

##### 6.5.3.1.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-4 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of *NR* UE release 15 and forward.

##### 6.5.3.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-4 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1.3-1
starting from the edge of the assigned *NR* channel bandwidth. The
spurious emission limits in Table 6.5.3.1.3-2 apply for all transmitter
band configurations (NRB) and channel bandwidths. The requirement is
verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam
peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

##### 6.5.3.1.4 Test description {#test-description-4 .H6}

##### 6.5.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-4 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5.3.1.4.1-1. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes
A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified
in Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.3 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to
TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.5.3.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5.3.1.4.3.

##### 6.5.3.1.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-4 .H6}

1\. Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\. If the re-positioning concept is applied, position the device in DUT
Orientation 1 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1;
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) if the
maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for the alignment option selected
in step 1. If the re-positioning concept is not applied, position the
device in DUT Orientation 1.

3\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5.3.1.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

4\. Set the UE in the Inband Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP
scan as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

5\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3)
for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

6\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

7\. Measure the spurious emissions as per steps outlined below with an
exception to the procedure in Annex K if the re-positioning concept is
applied (NOTE 4). Step (a) is optional and applicable only if SNR (test
requirement level in Table 6.5.3.1.5-1 minus offset value minus noise
floor of the test system) ≥ 0 dB is guaranteed. During measurement the
spectrum analyser shall be set to \'Detector\' = RMS. If the sweep count
is higher than one, the trace mode shall be average.

\(a\) Perform coarse TRP measurements to identify spurious emission
frequencies and corresponding power level according to the procedures in
Annex K, using coarse TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3. The measurement is completed
in both polarizations *θ* and *φ* over frequency range and measurement
bandwidth according to Table 6.5.3.1.5-1. Optionally, a larger and
non-constant measurement bandwidth than that of Table 6.5.3.1.5-1 may be
applied. The measurement period shall capture the active time slots.

For each spurious emission frequency with coarse TRP identified to be
less than the offsets listed in Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through
6.5.3.1.4.2-3from the TRP limit according to Table 6.5.3.1.5-1, either
continue with another coarse TRP procedure and corresponding offset
according to step (a) or continue with fine TRP procedures according to
step (b).

> Different coarse TRP grids and corresponding offset values may be used
> for different frequencies.Multiple coarse TRP grids measurements with
> the corresponding offset values can be performed before the fine TRP
> measurement grid is applied. The coarse TRP grids and offset values
> used shall be recorded in the test report.

\(b\) Measure fine TRP measurements according to procedures in Annex K,
using fine TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per Table M.4.5-3
in Annex M, for each of the spurious emission frequency identified in
step (a). Apply a measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.5.3.1.5-1.

8\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

NOTE 1: The frequency range defined in Table 6.5.3.1.5-1 may be split
into ranges. For each range a different test system, e.g. antenna and/or
chamber, may be used. To pass the test case all verdicts of the
frequency ranges must pass.

NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 3: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

NOTE 4: If the (in-band) beam peak is within 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 1 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 2. If the
(in-band) beam peak is within 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 2 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 1. The DUT
with UBF activated needs to be re-positioned during the test.

NOTE 5: Void.

##### 6.5.3.1.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-4 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 6.5.3.1.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-4 .H6}

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified *NR* band for
Transmitter Spurious emissions requirement with frequency range as
indicated in Table 6.5.3.1.5-1.

The maximum TRP power of spurious emission, measured using RMS detector,
shall not exceed the described value in Table 6.5.3.1.5-1.

Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1.3-1
starting from the edge of the assigned *NR* channel bandwidth. The
spurious emission limits in Table 6.5.3.1.5-1 apply for all transmitter
band configurations (NRB) and channel bandwidths.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

Editor's Note: This clause is complete for Band n257, n258, n259, n260
and n261 for PC1 and and PC3. The following aspects of the clause are
for future consideration:

\- TRP Measurement uncertainty is TBD for above 87 GHz.

\- Test procedure only includes the testing of smartphone and is FFS for
laptop and FWA.

\- For a transition period until RAN5\#103 meeting (May 2024), previous
fine/coarse TRP measurement grid and offset values for corresponding
coarse TRP measurement in TS 38.521-2 V17.2.0 are allowed for TE
implementation.

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-5 .H6}

Same as clause 6.5.3.1.1.

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-5 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 16 and forward
supporting *mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16* UE capability.

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-5 .H6}

Same as clause 6.5.3.1.3.

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.4 Test description {#test-description-5 .H6}

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-5 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5.3.1\_1.4.1-1. The details of
the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in
Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are
specified in Annex C.2.

4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5.3.1\_1.4.3.

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-5 .H6}

Same as clause 6.5.3.1.4.2 with following exceptions:

\- Instead of Table 6.5.3.1.4.1-1 use Table 6.2.1.1.4.1-1 in normal
environmental conditions only.

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-5 .H6}

Same as clause 6.2.4\_1.4.3.

##### 6.5.3.1\_1.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-5 .H6}

Same as clause 6.5.3.1.5.

#### 6.5.3.2 Spurious emission band UE co-existence

Editor's note: This clause is complete for Band n257, n258, n259, n260
and n261 and for PC1, PC3, PC5, PC6. The following aspects of the clause
are for future consideration:

\- TRP Measurement uncertainty is TBD for PC2 and PC4.

\- Test procedure is FFS for laptop.

\- For a transition period until RAN\#102 meeting (Dec 2023), the
implementation of note 4 in Table 6.5.3.2.4.1-1 in test equipment is not
applicable to avoid lack of test coverage until testcase 6.5.3.2\_1 is
available.

\- For a transition period until RAN5\#103 meeting (May 2024), previous
fine/coarse TRP measurement grid and offset values for corresponding
coarse TRP measurement in TS 38.521-2 V17.2.0 are allowed for TE
implementation.

##### 6.5.3.2.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-6 .H6}

To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference
when in co-existence with protected bands in terms of transmitter
spurious emissions.

##### 6.5.3.2.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-6 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of *NR* UE release 15 and forward.

##### 6.5.3.2.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-6 .H6}

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified NR band, for
co-existence with protected bands. The requirement is verified in beam
locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction,
Meas=TRP grid).

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

The spurious emission UE co-existence limits in Table 6.5.3.2.3-1 apply
for all transmitter band configurations (RB) and channel bandwidths.

##### 6.5.3.2.4 Test description {#test-description-6 .H6}

##### 6.5.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-6 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5.3.2.4.1-1. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes
A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified
in Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.3 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to
TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.5.3.2.4.1-1

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5.3.2.4.3.

##### 6.5.3.2.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-6 .H6}

1\. Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\. If the re-positioning concept is applied, position the device in DUT
Orientation 1 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1;
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) if the
maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for the alignment option selected
in step 1. If the re-positioning concept is not applied, position the
device in DUT Orientation 1.

3\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5.3.2.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

4\. Set the UE in the Inband Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP
scan as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

5\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3)
for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

6\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

7\. Measure the spurious emissions as per steps outlined below with an
exception to the procedure in Annex K if the re-positioning concept is
applied (NOTE 4). During measurement the spectrum analyser shall be set
to \'Detector\' = RMS. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace
mode shall be average.

\(a\) Perform coarse TRP measurements to identify spurious emission
frequencies and corresponding power level according to the procedures in
Annex K, using coarse TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3. The measurement is completed
in both polarizations *θ* and *φ* over frequency range and measurement
bandwidth according to Table 6.5.3.2.3-1. Optionally, a larger and
non-constant measurement bandwidth than that of Table 6.5.3.2.3-1 may be
applied as long as the SNR (ratio of test limit to floor noise of test
equipment) ≥ 10dB is guaranteed. The measurement period shall capture
the active time slots. For each spurious emission frequency with coarse
TRP identified to be less than the offsets listed in Tables
6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3from the TRP limit according to Table
6.5.3.2.3-1, either continue with another coarse TRP procedure and
corresponding offset according to step (a) or continue with fine TRP
procedures according to step (b).

> Different coarse TRP grids and corresponding offset values may be used
> for different frequencies. Multiple coarse TRP grids measurements with
> the corresponding offset values can be performed before the fine TRP
> measurement grid is applied. The coarse TRP grids and offset values
> used shall be recorded in the test report.

\(b\) Measure fine TRP measurements according to procedures in Annex K,
using fine TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per Table M.4.5-3
in Annex M, for each of the spurious emission frequency identified in
step (a). Apply a measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.5.3.2.3-1.

8\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

NOTE 1: The frequency range defined in Table 6.5.3.2.3-1 may be split
into ranges. For each range a different test system, e.g. antenna and/or
chamber, may be used. To pass the test case all verdicts of the
frequency ranges must pass.

NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 3: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

NOTE 4: If the (in-band) beam peak is within 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 1 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 2. If the
(in-band) beam peak is within 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 2 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 1. The DUT
with UBF activated needs to be re-positioned during the test.

##### 6.5.3.2.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-6 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 6.5.3.2.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-6 .H6}

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified *NR* band for
Transmitter Spurious emissions for UE co-existence requirement with
frequency range as indicated in Table 6.5.3.2.5-1.

The maximum TRP power of spurious emission for UE co-existence, measured
using RMS detector, shall not exceed the described value in Table
6.5.3.2.5-1.

The spurious emission UE co-existence limits in Table 6.5.3.2.5-1 apply
for all transmitter band configurations (NRB) and channel bandwidths.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

##### 6.5.3.2\_1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-7 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5.3.2.1\_1.4.1-1. The details
of the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in
Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are
specified in Annex C.2.

Table 6.5.3.3.3-3 apply for all transmitter band configurations (RB) and
channel bandwidths. The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with
the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

##### 6.5.3.3.4 Test description {#test-description-8 .H6}

##### 6.5.3.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-8 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5.3.3.4.1-1. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes
A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified
in Annex C.2.

uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.5.3.3.4.1-1

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5.3.3.4.3.

##### 6.5.3.3.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-8 .H6}

> 1\. Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
> N.2-1 through N.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\. If the re-positioning concept is applied, position the device in DUT
Orientation 1 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1;
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) if the
maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for the alignment option selected
in step 1. If the re-positioning concept is not applied, position the
device in DUT Orientation 1.

3\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5.3.3.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

4\. Set the UE in the Inband Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP
scan as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

5\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3)
for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

6\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

7\. Measure the spurious emissions as per steps outlined below with an
exception to the procedure in Annex K if the re-positioning concept is
applied (NOTE 4). Step (a) is optional and applicable only if SNR (test
requirement level in Table 6.5.3.3.5-2 through Table 6.5.3.3.5-3, minus
offset value minus noise floor of the test system) ≥ 0 dB is guaranteed.
During measurement the spectrum analyser shall be set to \'Detector\' =
RMS. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace mode shall be
average.

\(a\) Perform coarse TRP measurements to identify spurious emission
frequencies and corresponding power level according to the procedures in
Annex K, using coarse TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3. The measurement is completed
in both polarizations *θ* and *φ* over frequency range and measurement
bandwidth according to Table 6.5.3.3.5-2 through Table 6.5.3.3.5-3.
Optionally, a larger and non-constant measurement bandwidth than that of
Table 6.5.3.3.5-2 through Table 6.5.3.3.5-3 may be applied. The
measurement period shall capture the active time slots. For each
spurious emission frequency with coarse TRP identified to be less than
the offset listed in Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3from the
TRP limit according to Table 6.5.3.3.5-2 through Table 6.5.3.3.5-3,
either continue with another coarse TRP procedure and corresponding
offset according to step (a) or continue with fine TRP procedures
according to step (b).

> Different coarse TRP grids and corresponding offset values may be used
> for different frequencies. Multiple coarse TRP grids measurements with
> the corresponding offset values can be performed before the fine TRP
> measurement grid is applied. The coarse TRP grids and offset values
> used shall be recorded in the test report.

\(b\) Measure fine TRP measurements according to procedures in Annex K,
using fine TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per Table M.4.5-3
in Annex M, for each of the spurious emission frequency identified in
step (a). Apply a measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.5.3.3.5-2
through Table 6.5.3.3.5-3.

8\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

NOTE 1: The frequency range defined in Table 6.5.3.3.5-2 through Table
6.5.3.3.5-3 may be split into ranges. For each range a different test
system, e.g. antenna and/or chamber, may be used. To pass the test case
all verdicts of the frequency ranges must pass.

NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 3: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

NOTE 4: If the (in-band) beam peak is within 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 1 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 2. If the
(in-band) beam peak is within 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 2 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 1. The DUT
with UBF activated needs to be re-positioned during the test.

6.5A Output RF spectrum emissions for CA
----------------------------------------

### 6.5A.1 Occupied bandwidth for CA

#### 6.5A.1.0 Minimum conformance requirements

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
6.5A.1.

##### 6.5A.1.0.0 General {#a.1.0.0-general .H6}

The occupied bandwidth for UL CA is defined as a directional
requirement. The requirement is verified in beam locked mode on beam
peak direction. In case the CA configuration consists of a single UL CC,
the occupied bandwidth requirement defined in subclause 6.5.1 applies.

##### 6.5A.1.0.1 Occupied bandwidth for intra-band contiguous UL CA {#a.1.0.1-occupied-bandwidth-for-intra-band-contiguous-ul-ca .H6}

For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the occupied bandwidth
is a measure of the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total integrated
power of the transmitted spectrum. The occupied bandwidth for UL CA
shall be less than the UL aggregated channel bandwidth defined in clause
5.3A.

##### 6.5A.1.0.2 Occupied bandwidth for intra-band non-contiguous UL CA {#a.1.0.2-occupied-bandwidth-for-intra-band-non-contiguous-ul-ca .H6}

TBD

#### 6.5A.1.1 Occupied bandwidth for CA (2UL CA)

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz and for intra-band
    non-contiguous CA are TBD

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS

-   TP analysis is FFS

-   For a transition period of 2 meeting cycles after the test case is
    complete, the stability and repeatability of test procedure with PHR
    (variant b) for Rel-15 UEs is under evaluation.

##### 6.5A.1.1.1 Test purpose {#a.1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that the UE occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations supported by the UE are less than their specific limits.

##### 6.5A.1.1.2 Test applicability {#a.1.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 2UL CA.

##### 6.5A.1.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.1.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.5A.1.0.

##### 6.5A.1.1.4 Test description {#a.1.1.4-test-description .H6}

##### 6.5A.1.1.4.1 Initial condition {#a.1.1.4.1-initial-condition .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR CA configuration specified in clause 5.5A. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
CA combination and subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table
6.5A.1.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement channels
(RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement Channel is set according to Table
6.5A.1.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in State RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR,* Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.1.1.4.3.

##### 6.5A.1.1.4.2 Test procedure {#a.1.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2, and C.3.0 for all
downlink physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.1.1.4.3.

3\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

3a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS applies a backoff on the
PCell power by activating the UE Power Limit Function (UPLF). The
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST procedure is performed as specified in TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.32 TOTAL NR AGGREGATED BANDWIDTH and PCELL NR
bandwidth as per Test CC Combination setting. UE shall transmit ACTIVATE
POWER LIMIT RESPONSE to SS. Go to step 4.

3b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

4\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321 \[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.2).

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5A.1.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC(s). Since the UE has no payload
and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the
UL RMC.

6\. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

7\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

7a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: Send continuously uplink power
control \"up\" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the
UE; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to reach maximum output power.
Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam
selection to complete.

7b For Release 15 5G NR UEs: Send uplink power control commands in
uplink scheduling information to the UE per UL CC until the Power
Headroom Report (PHR) from the UE for each UL CC is at the target value
according to Table 6.2A.2.1.4.2-1. ; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to
reach maximum output power. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

8\. Measure the EIRP spectrum distribution over all component carriers
within 1.5 times or more frequency range over the requirement for
Occupied Bandwidth for CA specification centring on the centre of
aggregated channel bandwidth. The characteristics of the filter shall be
approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyser filter). The measuring
duration is one active uplink subframe. EIRP is captured from both
polarizations, theta and phi.

9\. Calculate the total EIRP from both polarizations, theta and phi,
within the range of all frequencies measured in step 4 and save this
value as "Total EIRP". EIRP measurement procedure is defined in Annex K.

10\. Identify the measurement window whose centre is aligned on the
centre of the channel for which the sum of the power measured in theta
and phi polarization is 99% of the "Total EIRP".

11\. The "Occupied Bandwidth" is the width of the measurement window
obtained in step 9.

12\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

12a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS deactivates the UE Power
Limit Function (UPLF) by performing the DEACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.33.

12a. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

##### 6.5A.1.2.5 Test requirement {#a.1.2.5-test-requirement .H6}

The measured Occupied Bandwidth shall not exceed the aggregated channel
bandwidth defined in subclause 5.3A .

#### 6.5A.1.3 Occupied bandwidth for CA (4UL CA)

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz and for intra-band
    non-contiguous CA are TBD

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS

-   TP analysis is FFS

-   This test case is incomplete until a suitable solution for
    preventing SCell drop is implemented in the test procedure.

##### 6.5A.1.3.1 Test purpose {#a.1.3.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that the UE occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations supported by the UE are less than their specific limits.

##### 6.5A.1.3.2 Test applicability {#a.1.3.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 4UL CA.

##### 6.5A.1.3.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.1.3.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.5A.1.0.

##### 6.5A.1.3.4 Test description {#a.1.3.4-test-description .H6}

Same as in clause 6.5A.1.1.4 with following exceptions:

> \- Instead of Table 6.5A.1.1.4.1-1 use Table 6.5A.1.3.4-1.

##### 6.5A.1.3.5 Test requirement {#a.1.3.5-test-requirement .H6}

The measured Occupied Bandwidth shall not exceed the aggregated channel
bandwidth defined in subclause 5.3A .

#### 6.5A.1.4 Occupied bandwidth for CA (5UL CA)

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz and for intra-band
    non-contiguous CA are TBD

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS

-   TP analysis is FFS

##### 6.5A.1.4.1 Test purpose {#a.1.4.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that the UE occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations supported by the UE are less than their specific limits.

##### 6.5A.1.4.2 Test applicability {#a.1.4.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 5UL CA.

##### 6.5A.1.4.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.1.4.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.5A.1.0.

##### 6.5A.1.4.4 Test description {#a.1.4.4-test-description .H6}

Same as in clause 6.5A.1.1.4 with following exceptions:

\- Instead of Table 6.5A.1.1.4.1-1 use Table 6.5A.1.4.4-1.

##### 6.5A.1.4.5 Test requirement {#a.1.4.5-test-requirement .H6}

The measured Occupied Bandwidth shall not exceed the aggregated channel
bandwidth defined in subclause 5.3A .

#### 6.5A.1.5 Occupied bandwidth for CA (6UL CA)

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz and for intra-band
    non-contiguous CA are TBD

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS

-   TP analysis is FFS

-   This test case is incomplete until a suitable solution for
    preventing SCell drop is implemented in the test procedure.

##### 6.5A.1.5.1 Test purpose {#a.1.5.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that the UE occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations supported by the UE are less than their specific limits.

##### 6.5A.1.5.2 Test applicability {#a.1.5.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 6UL CA.

##### 6.5A.1.5.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.1.5.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.5A.1.0.

##### 6.5A.1.5.4 Test description {#a.1.5.4-test-description .H6}

Same as in clause 6.5A.1.1.4 with following exceptions:

\- Instead of Table 6.5A.1.1.4.1-1 use Table 6.5A.1.5.4-1.

##### 6.5A.1.6.5 Test requirement {#a.1.6.5-test-requirement .H6}

The measured Occupied Bandwidth shall not exceed the aggregated channel
bandwidth defined in subclause 5.3A .

#### 6.5A.1.7 Occupied bandwidth for CA (8UL CA)

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz and for intra-band
    non-contiguous CA are TBD

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS

-   TP analysis is FFS

-   This test case is incomplete until a suitable solution for
    preventing SCell drop is implemented in the test procedure.

##### 6.5A.1.7.1 Test purpose {#a.1.7.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that the UE occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations supported by the UE are less than their specific limits.

##### 6.5A.1.7.2 Test applicability {#a.1.7.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 8UL CA.

##### 6.5A.1.7.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.1.7.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.5A.1.0.

##### 6.5A.1.7.4 Test description {#a.1.7.4-test-description .H6}

Same as in clause 6.5A.1.1.4 with following exceptions:

\- Instead of Table 6.5A.1.1.4.1-1 use Table 6.5A.1.7.4-1.

##### 6.5A.1.7.5 Test requirement {#a.1.7.5-test-requirement .H6}

The measured Occupied Bandwidth shall not exceed the aggregated channel
bandwidth defined in subclause 5.3A.

### 6.5A.2 Out of band emission for CA

#### 6.5A.2.1 Spectrum Emission Mask for CA

##### 6.5A.2.1.0 Minimum conformance requirements

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
6.5A.2.1.

##### 6.5A.2.1.0.0 General {#a.2.1.0.0-general .H6}

The requirements specified in this clause shall apply if the UE has at
least one of UL or DL configured for CA or if the UE is configured for
single CC operation with different channel bandwidths in UL and DL
carriers. In case the CA configuration consists of a single UL CC,
spectrum emission mask defined in subclause 6.5.2.1 applies. Spectral
emission mask requirements do not apply at any frequency where IBE
requirements of clause 6.4A.2.3 apply.

The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of
TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction).

##### 6.5A.2.1.0.1 Spectrum emission mask for intra-band contiguous UL CA {#a.2.1.0.1-spectrum-emission-mask-for-intra-band-contiguous-ul-ca .H6}

For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spectrum emission
mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~) starting from the ± edge
of the UL aggregated channel bandwidth (Table 5.3A.4-1). For any
bandwidth class defined in Table 5.3A.4-1, the UE emission shall not
exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5A.2.1.0.1-1.

##### 6.5A.2.1.1 Spectrum Emission Mask for CA (2UL CA)

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power
    class other than 1, 3, 5.

-   For a transition period until RAN\#99, the stability and
    repeatability of test procedure with PHR (variant b) for Rel-15 UEs
    is under evaluation.

-   Test for DL intra-band non-contiguous configurations with UL
    intra-band contiguous configuration is FFS.

##### 6.5A.2.1.1.1 Test purpose {#a.2.1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that the power of any UE emission shall not exceed specified
levels for the specified channel bandwidth for CA.

##### 6.5A.2.1.1.2 Test applicability {#a.2.1.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 2UL CA.

##### 6.5A.2.1.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.2.1.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.5A.2.1.0.

##### 6.5A.2.1.1.4 Test description {#a.2.1.1.4-test-description .H6}

##### 6.5A.2.1.1.4.1 Initial condition {#a.2.1.1.4.1-initial-condition .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR CA configurations specified in clause 5.5A. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
CA combination and subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table
6.5A.2.1.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement
channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH
and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.1 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.5A.2.1.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.2.1.1.4.3

##### 6.5A.2.1.1.4.2 Test procedure {#a.2.1.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2, and C.3 for all
downlink physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.2.1.1.4.3.

3\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

3a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS applies a backoff on the
PCell power by activating the UE Power Limit Function (UPLF). The
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST procedure is performed as specified in TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.32 using TOTAL NR AGGREGATED BANDWIDTH and
PCELL NR bandwidth as per Test CC Combination setting. UE shall transmit
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT RESPONSE to SS. Go to step 4.

3b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

4\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321 \[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.3).

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5A.2.1.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC(s). Since the UE has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

7\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

7a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: Send continuously uplink power
control \"up\" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the
UE; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to reach maximum output power.
Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam
selection to complete.

7b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: Send uplink power control commands in
uplink scheduling information to the UE per UL CC until the Power
Headroom Report (PHR) from the UE for each UL CC is at the target value
according to Table 6.2A.2.1.4.2-1; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to
reach maximum output power. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

8\. Measure the TRP of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter
of bandwidths according to Table 6.5A.2.1.1.5-1 and using a rms
detector. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace mode shall be
average. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in
continuous steps according to the same table. TRP shall be recorded for
each step. The measurement period shall capture the active time slots.
Total radiated power is measured according to TRP measurement procedure
defined in Annex K. The measurement grid used for TRP measurement
defined in Annex M. TRP is calculated considering both polarizations,
theta and phi.

9\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

9a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs SS deactivates the UE Power
Limit Function (UPLF) by performing the DEACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.33.

9b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

NOTE 1: When switching to DFT-s-OFDM waveform, as specified in Table
6.5A.2.1.1.4.1-1, send an NR RRCReconfiguration message according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.6.3 Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition.

NOTE 2: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

#### 6.5A.2.2 Adjacent channel leakage ratio for CA

##### 6.5A.2.2.0 Minimum conformance requirements

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
6.5A.2.3.

##### 6.5A.2.2.0.1 Adjacent channel leakage ratio for intra-band contiguous UL CA {#a.2.2.0.1-adjacent-channel-leakage-ratio-for-intra-band-contiguous-ul-ca .H6}

In case the CA configuration consists of a single UL CC, the adjacent
channel leakage ratio defined in subclause 6.5.2.3 applies. For
intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the carrier aggregation NR
adjacent channel leakage power ratio (CA NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the UL aggregated channel bandwidth to
the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent UL aggregated channel
bandwidth at spacing equal to the UL aggregated channel bandwidth. The
assigned UL aggregated channel bandwidth power and adjacent UL
aggregated channel bandwidth power are measured with rectangular filters
with measurement bandwidths specified in Table 6.5A.2.2.0.1-1. If the
measured adjacent channel power is greater than -35 dBm then the CA
NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in Table
6.5A.2.2.0.1-1.

##### 6.5A.2.2.1 Adjacent channel leakage ratio for CA (2UL CA)

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances and Test limit
    analysis for intra-band contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \>
    400MHz is TBD.

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances and Test limit
    analysis are FFS for power class other than 1, 3, 5.

-   For a transition period until RAN\#99, the stability and
    repeatability of test procedure with PHR (variant b) for Rel-15 UEs
    is under evaluation.

-   Test for DL intra-band non-contiguous configurations with UL
    intra-band contiguous configuration is FFS.

##### 6.5A.2.2.1.1 Test purpose {#a.2.2.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference
to adjacent channels in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio
(ACLR) for CA.

##### 6.5A.2.2.1.2 Test applicability {#a.2.2.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 2UL CA.

##### 6.5A.2.2.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.2.2.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 6.5A.2.2.0.

##### 6.5A.2.2.1.4 Test description {#a.2.2.1.4-test-description .H6}

##### 6.5A.2.2.1.4.1 Initial condition {#a.2.2.1.4.1-initial-condition .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR CA configurations specified in clause 5.5A. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
CA combination and subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table
6.5A.2.2.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement
channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH
and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.1 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.5A.2.2.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.2.2.1.4.3

##### 6.5A.2.2.1.4.2 Test procedure {#a.2.2.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2, and C.3 for all
downlink physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.2.2.1.4.3.

3\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

3a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS applies a backoff on the
PCell power by activating the UE Power Limit Function (UPLF). The
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST procedure is performed as specified in TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.32 using TOTAL NR AGGREGATED BANDWIDTH and
PCELL NR bandwidth as per Test CC Combination setting. UE shall transmit
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT RESPONSE to SS. Go to step 4.

3b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

4\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321 \[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.3).

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5A.2.2.1.4.1-1 on both PCC and SCC(s). Since the UE has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

7\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

7a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: Send continuously uplink power
control \"up\" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the
UE; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to reach maximum output power.
Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 2) for the UE Tx beam
selection to complete.

7b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: Send uplink power control commands in
uplink scheduling information to the UE per UL CC until the Power
Headroom Report (PHR) from the UE for each UL CC is at the target value
according to Table 6.2A.2.1.4.2-1; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to
reach maximum output power. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

8\. Measure EIRP of the transmitted signal for the assigned NR channel
with a rectangular measurement filter with bandwidths according to Table
6.5A.2.2.1.5-1 and using a rms detector. If the sweep count is higher
than one, the trace mode shall be average. EIRP measurement procedure
defined in Annex K. EIRP is calculated considering both polarizations,
theta and phi.

9\. Measure EIRP of the first NR adjacent channel on both lower and
upper side of the assigned NR channel, respectively using a rectangular
measurement filter with bandwidths according to Table 6.5A.2.2.1.5-1 and
using a rms detector. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace
mode shall be average. EIRP measurement procedure defined in Annex K.
EIRP is calculated considering both polarizations, theta and phi.

10\. Calculate the ratios of the power between the values measured in
step 7 over step 8 for lower and upper NR~ACLR~, respectively.

11\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

11a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS deactivates the UE Power
Limit Function (UPLF) by performing the DEACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.33.

11b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

NOTE 1: When switching to DFT-s-OFDM waveform, as specified in Table
6.5A.2.2.1.4.1-1, send an NR RRCReconfiguration message according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.6.3 Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition.

NOTE 2: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

### 6.5A.3 Spurious emissions for CA 

#### 6.5A.3.1 General spurious emissions for CA

##### 6.5A.3.1.0 Minimum conformance requirements

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
6.5A.3.

##### 6.5A.3.1.0.0 General {#a.3.1.0.0-general .H6}

This clause specifies the spurious emission requirements for carrier
aggregation. The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the
test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid). The TX
beam peak direction used for CA testing is the \[same as that found for
single carrier scenario in clause 6.5.3\].

In case the CA configuration consists of a single UL CC, spurious
emissions requirements defined in subclause 6.5.3 apply. Spurious
emissions requirements do not apply at any frequency where IBE
requirements of clause 6.4A.2.3 apply.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

##### 6.5A.3.1.0.1 Spurious emissions for intra-band contiguous UL CA {#a.3.1.0.1-spurious-emissions-for-intra-band-contiguous-ul-ca .H6}

For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spurious emission
limits apply for the frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz)
from the edge of the UL aggregated channel bandwidth, where F~OOB~ is
defined as the twice the UL aggregated channel bandwidth. For
frequencies Δf~OOB~ greater than F~OOB~, the spurious emission
requirements in Table 6.5.3.1.3-2 are applicable.

##### 6.5A.3.1.0.2 Spurious emissions for intra-band non-contiguous UL CA {#a.3.1.0.2-spurious-emissions-for-intra-band-non-contiguous-ul-ca .H6}

TBD

##### 6.5A.3.1.1 General spurious emissions for CA (2UL CA)

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

\- The testability of this test case is pending further analysis on
relaxation of the requirement for band other than n257, n258, n260 and
n261.

\- Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power class
1, 2, and 4.

\- Test procedure only includes the testing of smartphone and is FFS for
laptop and FWA.

\- For a transition period until RAN\#99, the stability and
repeatability of test procedure with PHR (variant b) for Rel-15 UEs is
under evaluation.

\- For a transition period until RAN5\#103 meeting (May 2024), previous
fine/coarse TRP measurement grid and offset values for corresponding
coarse TRP measurement in TS 38.521-2 V17.2.0 are allowed for TE
implementation.

##### 6.5A.3.1.1.1 Test purpose {#a.3.1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference
to other channels or other systems in terms of transmitter spurious
emissions.

##### 6.5A.3.1.1.2 Test applicability {#a.3.1.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 2UL CA.

##### 6.5A.3.1.1.4.1 Initial condition {#a.3.1.1.4.1-initial-condition .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in clause 5.5A. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5A.3.1.1.4.1-1. The details of
the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in
Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are
specified in Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.3 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.5A.3.1.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.3.1.1.4.3

##### 6.5A.3.1.1.4.2 Test procedure {#a.3.1.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

1\. Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\. If the re-positioning concept is applied, position the device in DUT
Orientation 1 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1;
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) if the
maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for the alignment option selected
in step 1. If the re-positioning concept is not applied, position the
device in DUT Orientation 1.

3\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

4\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.3.1.1.4.3.

5\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

5a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS applies a backoff on the
PCell power by activating the UE Power Limit Function (UPLF). The
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST procedure is performed as specified in TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.32 using TOTAL NR AGGREGATED BANDWIDTH and
PCELL NR bandwidth as per Test CC Combination setting. UE shall transmit
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT RESPONSE to SS. Go to step 6.

5b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

6\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321 \[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.3).

7\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5A.3.1.1.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data
to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

8\. Set the UE in the Inband Tx beam peak direction \[(same as that
found for single carrier in clause 6.5.3)\] found with a 3D EIRP scan as
performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE
3) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

9\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

9a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: Send continuously uplink power
control \"up\" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the
UE; allow at least 200msec for the UE to reach P~UMAX~. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

9b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: Send uplink power control commands in
uplink scheduling information to the UE per UL CC until the Power
Headroom Report (PHR) from the UE for each UL CC is at the target value
according to Table 6.2A.2.1.4.2-1; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to
reach maximum output power. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.10. SS activates the
UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the procedure as specified in
TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using condition Tx only.

11\. Measure the spurious emissions as per steps outlined below with an
exception to the procedure in Annex K if the re-positioning concept is
applied (NOTE 4). During measurement the spectrum analyser shall be set
to \'Detector\' = RMS. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace
mode shall be average.

\(a\) Perform coarse TRP measurements to identify spurious emission
frequencies and corresponding power level according to the procedures in
Annex L, using coarse TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3. The measurement is completed
in both polarizations *θ* and *φ* over frequency range and measurement
bandwidth according to Table 6.5A.3.1.1.5-1. Optionally, a larger and
non-constant measurement bandwidth than that of Table 6.5A.3.1.1.5-1 may
be applied as long as the SNR (ratio of test limit to floor noise of
test equipment) ≥ 10dB is guaranteed. The measurement period shall
capture the \[active time slots\]. For each spurious emission frequency
with coarse TRP identified to be less than the offsets offsets listed in
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3 from the TRP limit according
to Table 6.5A.3.1.1.5-1, either continue with another coarse TRP
procedure and corresponding offset according to step (a) or continue
with fine TRP procedures according to step (b).

> Different coarse TRP grids and corresponding offset values may be used
> for different frequencies. Multiple coarse TRP grids measurements with
> the corresponding offset values can be performed before the fine TRP
> measurement grid is applied. The coarse TRP grids and offset values
> used shall be recorded in the test report.

\(b\) Measure fine TRP measurements according to procedures in Annex K,
using fine TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per Table M.4.5-3
in Annex M, for each of the spurious emission frequency identified in
step (a). Apply a measurement bandwidth according to Table
6.5A.3.1.1.5-1.

12\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

12a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs SS deactivates the UE Power
Limit Function (UPLF) by performing the DEACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.33.

12b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

13\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

NOTE 1: The frequency range defined in Table 6.5A.3.1.1.5-1 may be split
into ranges. For each range a different test system, e.g. antenna and/or
chamber, may be used. To pass the test case all verdicts of the
frequency ranges must pass.

NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 3: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

NOTE 4: If the (in-band) beam peak is within 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 1 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 2. If the
(in-band) beam peak is within 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 2 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 1. The DUT
with UBF activated needs to be re-positioned during the test.

##### 6.5A.3.1.1.5 Test Requirements {#a.3.1.1.5-test-requirements .H6}

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified *NR* band for
Transmitter Spurious emissions requirement with frequency range as
indicated in Table 6.5A.3.1.1.5-1.

The maximum TRP power of spurious emission, measured using RMS detector,
shall not exceed the described value in Table 6.5A.3.1.1.5-1.

Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1.3-1
starting from the edge of the assigned *NR* channel bandwidth. The
spurious emission limits in Table 6.5A.3.1.1.5-1 apply for all
transmitter band configurations (NRB) and channel bandwidths.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

#### 6.5A.3.2 Spurious emission band UE co-existence for UL CA

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified carrier
aggregation configurations for coexistence with protected bands. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid). The TX beam peak direction
used for CA testing is the \[same as that found for single carrier
scenario in clause 6.5.3\].

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

##### 6.5A.3.2.0 Minimum conformance requirements

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirements in Table
6.5A.3.2.0-1 apply.

##### 6.5A.3.2.1 Spurious emission band UE co-existence for CA (2UL CA)

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

\- The testability of this test case is pending further analysis on
relaxation of the requirement for band other than n257, n258, n260 and
n261.

\- Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power class
1, 2, and 4.

\- Test procedure only includes the testing of smartphone and is FFS for
laptop and FWA.

\- For a transition period until RAN\#99, the stability and
repeatability of test procedure with PHR (variant b) for Rel-15 UEs is
under evaluation.

\- For a transition period until RAN5\#103 meeting (May 2024), previous
fine/coarse TRP measurement grid and offset values for corresponding
coarse TRP measurement in TS 38.521-2 V17.2.0 are allowed for TE
implementation.

##### 6.5A.3.2.1.1 Test purpose {#a.3.2.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference
when in co-existence with protected bands in terms of transmitter
spurious emissions.

##### 6.5A.3.2.1.2 Test applicability {#a.3.2.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 2UL CA.

##### 6.5A.3.2.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.3.2.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

Same minimum conformance requirements as in clause 6.5A.3.2.0.

##### 6.5A.3.2.1.4 Test description {#a.3.2.1.4-test-description .H6}

##### 6.5A.3.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.3.2.1.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in clause 5.5A. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5A.3.2.1.4.1-1. The details of
the uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in
Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are
specified in Annex C.2.

4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.3.2.1.4.3.

##### 6.5A.3.2.1.4.2 Test procedure {#a.3.2.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

1\. Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\. If the re-positioning concept is applied, position the device in DUT
Orientation 1 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1;
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) if the
maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for the alignment option selected
in step 1. If the re-positioning concept is not applied, position the
device in DUT Orientation 1.

3\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

4\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.3.2.1.4.3.

5\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

5a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS applies a backoff on the
PCell power by activating the UE Power Limit Function (UPLF). The
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST procedure is performed as specified in TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.32 using TOTAL NR AGGREGATED BANDWIDTH and
PCELL NR bandwidth as per Test CC Combination setting. UE shall transmit
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT RESPONSE to SS. Go to step 6.

5b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

6\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321 \[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.3).

7\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5A.3.2.1.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data
to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

8\. Set the UE in the Inband Tx beam peak direction \[(same as that
found for single carrier in clause 6.5.3)\] found with a 3D EIRP scan as
performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE
3) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

9\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

9a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: Send continuously uplink power
control \"up\" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the
UE; allow at least 200msec for the UE to reach P~UMAX~. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

9b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: Send uplink power control commands in
uplink scheduling information to the UE per UL CC until the Power
Headroom Report (PHR) from the UE for each UL CC is at the target value
according to Table 6.2A.2.1.4.2-1; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to
reach maximum output power. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

10\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

11\. Measure the spurious emissions as per steps outlined below with an
exception to the procedure in Annex K if the re-positioning concept is
applied (NOTE 4). During measurement the spectrum analyser shall be set
to \'Detector\' = RMS. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace
mode shall be average.

\(a\) Perform coarse TRP measurements to identify spurious emission
frequencies and corresponding power level according to the procedures in
Annex L, using coarse TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3. The measurement is completed
in both polarizations *θ* and *φ* over frequency range and measurement
bandwidth according to Table 6.5A.3.2.1.5-1. Optionally, a larger and
non-constant measurement bandwidth than that of Table 6.5A.3.2.1.5-1 may
be applied as long as the SNR (ratio of test limit to floor noise of
test equipment) ≥ 10dB is guaranteed. The measurement period shall
capture the \[active time slots\]. For each spurious emission frequency
with coarse TRP identified to be less than an offset dB (NOTE 2) from
the TRP limit according to Table 6.5A.3.2.1.5-1, either continue with
another coarse TRP procedure and corresponding offset according to step
(a) or continue with fine TRP procedures according to step (b).

> . Different coarse TRP grids and corresponding offset values may be
> used for different frequencies. Multiple coarse TRP grids measurements
> with the corresponding offset values can be performed before the fine
> TRP measurement grid is applied. The coarse TRP grids and offset
> values used shall be recorded in the test report.

\(b\) Measure fine TRP measurements according to procedures in Annex K,
using fine TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per Table M.4.5-3
in Annex M, for each of the spurious emission frequency identified in
step (a). Apply a measurement bandwidth according to Table
6.5A.3.2.1.5-1.

12\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

12a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS deactivates the UE Power
Limit Function (UPLF) by performing the DEACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.33.

12b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

13\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

NOTE 1: The frequency range defined in Table 6.5A.3.2.1.5-1 may be split
into ranges. For each range a different test system, e.g. antenna and/or
chamber, may be used. To pass the test case all verdicts of the
frequency ranges must pass.

NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 3: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

NOTE 4: If the (in-band) beam peak is within 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 1 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 2. If the
(in-band) beam peak is within 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 2 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 1. The DUT
with UBF activated needs to be re-positioned during the test.

##### 6.5A.3.2.1.5 Test requirement {#a.3.2.1.5-test-requirement .H6}

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified *NR* band for
Transmitter Spurious emissions for UE co-existence requirement with
frequency range as indicated in Table 6.5A.3.2.1.5-1.

The maximum TRP power of spurious emission for UE co-existence, measured
using RMS detector, shall not exceed the described value in Table
6.5A.3.2.1.5-1.

The spurious emission UE co-existence limits in Table 6.5A.3.2.1.5-1
apply for all transmitter band configurations (NRB) and channel
bandwidths.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

#### 6.5A.3.3 Additional spurious emissions for CA

##### 6.5A.3.3.0 Minimum conformance requirements

The additional spurious emission for CA limits in Table 6.5A.3.3.0-2 and
Table 6.5A.3.3.0-3 apply for all transmitter band configurations (RB)
and channel bandwidths. The requirement is verified in beam locked mode
with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP
grid).

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

Table 6.5A.3.3.0-1: Void

When \" CA\_NS\_202\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE
emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5A.3.3.0-2.

When \"CA\_NS\_203\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE
emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5A.3.3.0-3.
This requirement also applies for the frequency ranges that are less
than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5A.3.2.0-1 from the edge of the channel
bandwidth.

##### 6.5A.3.3.1 Additional spurious emissions for CA (2UL CA)

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

\- This test case is incomplete for Power classes other than 1, 3, 5 and
CA other than intra-band contiguous.

\- Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power class
other than 1, 3, 5 and CA other than intra-band contiguous.

\- The testability of this test case is pending further analysis on
relaxation of the requirement for band other than n257, n258.

\- Test procedure only includes the testing of smartphone and is FFS for
laptop.

\- For a transition period until RAN\#99, the stability and
repeatability of test procedure with PHR (variant b) for Rel-15 UEs is
under evaluation.

##### 6.5A.3.3.1.1 Test purpose {#a.3.3.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

Additional spurious emission requirements are signalled by the network
to indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a
specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast
message.

##### 6.5A.3.3.1.2 Test applicability {#a.3.3.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 2UL CA.

##### 6.5A.3.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.3.3.1.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in clause 5.5A. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table 6.5A.3.3.1.4.1-1 and Table
6.5A.3.3.1.4.1-2. The details of the uplink reference measurement
channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2. Configurations of PDSCH
and PDCCH before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

##### 6.5A.3.3.1.4.2 Test procedure {#a.3.3.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

1\. Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\. If the re-positioning concept is applied, position the device in DUT
Orientation 1 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1;
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) if the
maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for the alignment option selected
in step 1. If the re-positioning concept is not applied, position the
device in DUT Orientation 1.

3\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

4\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 6.5A.3.3.1.4.3.

5\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

5a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS applies a backoff on the
PCell power by activating the UE Power Limit Function (UPLF). The
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST procedure is performed as specified in TS
38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.32 using TOTAL NR AGGREGATED BANDWIDTH and
PCELL NR bandwidth as per Test CC Combination setting. UE shall transmit
ACTIVATE POWER LIMIT RESPONSE to SS. Go to step 6.

5b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

6\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321 \[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.3).

7\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5A.3.3.1.4.1-1 or Table 6.5A.3.3.1.4.1-2. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.

8\. Set the UE in the Inband Tx beam peak direction \[(same as that
found for single carrier in clause 6.5.3)\] found with a 3D EIRP scan as
performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE
3) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

9\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

9a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: Send continuously uplink power
control \"up\" commands in every uplink scheduling information to the
UE; allow at least 200msec for the UE to reach P~UMAX~. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

9b For Release 15 5G NR UEs: Send uplink power control commands in
uplink scheduling information to the UE per UL CC until the Power
Headroom Report (PHR) from the UE for each UL CC is at the target value
according to Table 6.2A.2.1.4.2-1; allow at least 200 ms for the UE to
reach maximum output power. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

10\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

11\. Measure the spurious emissions as per steps outlined below with an
exception to the procedure in Annex K if the re-positioning concept is
applied (NOTE 4). During measurement the spectrum analyser shall be set
to \'Detector\' = RMS. If the sweep count is higher than one, the trace
mode shall be average.

\(a\) Perform coarse TRP measurements to identify spurious emission
frequencies and corresponding power level according to the procedures in
Annex L, using coarse TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3. The measurement is completed
in both polarizations *θ* and *φ* over frequency range and measurement
bandwidth according to Table 6.5A.3.3.1.5-2. Optionally, a larger and
non-constant measurement bandwidth than that of Table 6.5A.3.3.1.5-2 may
be applied as long as the SNR (ratio of test limit to floor noise of
test equipment) ≥ 10dB is guaranteed. The measurement period shall
capture the \[active time slots\]. For each spurious emission frequency
with coarse TRP identified to be less than the offset listed in Tables
6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3 from the TRP limit according to
Table 6.5A.3.3.1.5-2, either continue with another coarse TRP procedure
and corresponding offset according to step (a) or continue with fine TRP
procedures according to step (b).

> Different coarse TRP grids and corresponding offset values may be used
> for different frequencies. Multiple coarse TRP grids measurements with
> the corresponding offset values can be performed before the fine TRP
> measurement grid is applied. The coarse TRP grids and offset values
> used shall be recorded in the test report.

\(b\) Measure fine TRP measurements according to procedures in Annex K,
using fine TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per Table M.4.5-3
in Annex M, for each of the spurious emission frequency identified in
step (a). Apply a measurement bandwidth according to Table
6.5A.3.3.1.5-2.

12\. Apply the test step based on the 5G NR UE Release:

12a. For Release 16 and forward 5G NR UEs: SS deactivates the UE Power
Limit Function (UPLF) by performing the DEACTIVATE POWER LIMIT REQUEST
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.33.

12b. For Release 15 5G NR UEs: No action.

13\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

NOTE 1: The frequency range defined in Table 6.5A.3.3.1.5-2 may be split
into ranges. For each range a different test system, e.g. antenna and/or
chamber, may be used. To pass the test case all verdicts of the
frequency ranges must pass.

NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 3: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

NOTE 4: If the (in-band) beam peak is within 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 1 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 2. If the
(in-band) beam peak is within 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 2 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 1. The DUT
with UBF activated needs to be re-positioned during the test.

3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200 ms for the
UE to reach maximum output power. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

4\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

5\. Measure the EIRP spectrum distribution within 1.5 times or more
frequency range over the requirement for Occupied Bandwidth
specification centring on the current carrier frequency. The
characteristics of the filter shall be approximately Gaussian (typical
spectrum analyser filter). The measuring duration is one active uplink
subframe. EIRP is captured from both polarizations, theta and phi.

6\. Calculate the total EIRP from both polarizations, theta and phi,
within the range of all frequencies measured in step 5 and save this
value as \"Total EIRP\". EIRP measurement procedure is defined in Annex
K.

7\. Identify the measurement window whose centre is aligned on the
centre of the channel for which the sum of the power measured in theta
and phi polarization is 99% of the "Total EIRP".

8\. The "Occupied Bandwidth" is the width of the measurement window
obtained in step 7.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

6.6 Beam correspondence
-----------------------

### 6.6.0 General

Beam correspondence is the ability of the UE to select a suitable beam
for UL transmission based on DL measurements with or without relying on
UL beam sweeping. The beam correspondence requirement is satisfied
assuming the presence of both SSB and CSI-RS signal and Type D QCL is
maintained between SSB and CSI-RS.

Enhanced Beam correspondence is the ability of the UE to select a
suitable beam for UL transmission based on DL measurements with or
without relying on UL beam sweeping. The beam correspondence requirement
is satisfied assuming the presence of either SSB and CSI-RS signal.

### 6.6.1 Beam correspondence - EIRP

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

\- The test case is incomplete for band n259.

##### 6.6.1.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-10 .H6}

To verify the UE's ability to select a suitable beam for UL transmission
based on DL measurements with or without relying on UL beam sweeping
within the range prescribed by the specified nominal maximum output
power and beam correspondence tolerance.

6.6.1.2 Test applicability

This test case is applicable only in in RRC\_CONNECTED mode to all types
of NR Power Class 3 UE release 15 that do not support beam
correspondence without UL beam sweeping.

This test case is applicable only in in RRC\_CONNECTED mode to all types
of NR Power Class 3 UE release 16 and forward that do not support
SSB-based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam correspondence and do not
support beam correspondence without UL beam sweeping.

##### 6.6.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-10 .H6}

##### 6.6.1.3.1 (Void) {#void-1 .H6}

##### 6.6.1.3.2 (Void) {#void-2 .H6}

##### 6.6.1.3.3 Beam correspondence for PC3 {#beam-correspondence-for-pc3 .H6}

##### 6.6.1.3.3.1 General {#general-1 .H6}

The beam correspondence requirement for PC3 UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED
consists of three components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as defined in clause
6.2.1.1.3.3), UE spherical coverage (as defined in clause 6.2.1.1.3.3),
and beam correspondence tolerance (as defined in clause 6.6.1.3.3.2).
The beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE satisfies one
of the following conditions, depending on the UE's beam correspondence
capability IE *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*, as defined in
TS 38.306 \[26\]:

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is supported, the UE
shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.3-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.3-3 with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink
beam sweeping. Such a UE is considered to have met the beam
correspondence tolerance requirement.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present, the UE
shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.3-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.3-3 with uplink beam sweeping. Such a UE shall meet the beam
correspondence tolerance requirement defined in Clause 6.6.1.3.3.2 and
shall support uplink beam management, as defined in TS 38.306 \[26\].

##### 6.6.1.3.3.1.1 Side condition for SSB and CSI-RS {#side-condition-for-ssb-and-csi-rs .H6}

The beam correspondence requirements are only applied under the
following conditions:

\- The downlink reference signals including both SSB and CSI-RS are
provided and Type D QCL shall be maintained between SSB and CSI-RS.

\- The reference measurement channel for beam correspondence are
fulfilled according to the CSI-RS configuration in Annex A.3.

\- The beam correspondence conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are
fulfilled according to Table 6.6.1.3.3.1.1-1 and Table 6.6.1.3.3.1.1-2.

##### 6.6.1.3.3.2 Beam correspondence tolerance for PC3 {#beam-correspondence-tolerance-for-pc3 .H6}

The beam correspondence tolerance requirement ∆EIRP~BC~ for power class
3 UEs is defined based on a percentile of the distribution of ∆EIRP~BC~,
defined as ∆EIRP~BC~ = EIRP~2~ - EIRP~1~ over the link angles spanning a
subset of the spherical coverage grid points, such that

\- EIRP~1~ is the total EIRP in dBm calculated based on the beam the UE
chooses autonomously (corresponding beam) to transmit in the direction
of the incoming DL signal, which is based on beam correspondence without
relying on UL beam sweeping.

\- EIRP~2~ is the best total EIRP (beam yielding highest EIRP in a given
direction) in dBm which is based on beam correspondence with relying on
UL beam sweeping.

\- The link angles are the ones corresponding to the top N^th^
percentile of the EIRP~2~ measurement over the whole sphere, where the
value of N is according to the test point of EIRP spherical coverage
requirement for power class 3, i.e. N = 50.

For power class 3 UEs, the requirement is fulfilled if the UE's
corresponding UL beams satisfy the maximum limit in Table 6.6.1.3.3.2-1.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
6.6.4.

##### 6.6.1.3.6.1 General {#general-2 .H6}

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 7 UEs in
RRC\_CONNECTED consists of two components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as
defined in Clause 6.2.1.1.3.7), and UE spherical coverage (as defined in
Clause 6.2.1.1.3.7). The beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled if
the UE satisfies one of the following conditions, depending on the UE\'s
beam correspondence capability IE
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*, as defined in TS 38.306
\[26\]:

\-- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is supported, the UE
shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.7-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.7-3 with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink
beam sweeping. Such a UE is considered to have met the beam
correspondence tolerance requirement.

##### 6.6.1.3.6.1.1 Side Condition for beam correspondence based on SSB and CSI-RS {#side-condition-for-beam-correspondence-based-on-ssb-and-csi-rs .H6}

The beam correspondence requirements are only applied under the
following side conditions:

\- The downlink reference signals including both SSB and CSI-RS are
provided and Type D QCL shall be maintained between SSB and CSI-RS.

\- The reference measurement channel for beam correspondence is
fulfilled according to the CSI-RS configuration in Annex A.3.

\- For beam correspondence, conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are
fulfilled according to Table 6.6.1.3.6.1.1-1 and Table 6.6.1.3.6.1.1-2.

##### 6.6.1.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-10 .H6}

Test procedure without uplink beam sweeping:

> 1.1 SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process
> via PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according
> to Table 6.6.1.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data
> to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. Messages
> to configure the appropriate uplink modulation in section 6.6.1.4.3.
>
> 1.1a. The side conditions for SSB-based and CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
> measurements are applied as per clause 6.6.1.3.3.1.3 for PC3.
>
> 1.2. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP
> scan as performed in Annex K.1.1 without uplink beam sweeping (i.e.,
> not executing steps 5.1) to step 5.5) in Annex K.1.1). Allow at least
> BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to
> complete.

1.3. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200 msec to
ensure that the UE transmits at its maximum output power. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

> 1.4. Measure UE EIRP~1~ in the Tx beam peak direction in the channel
> bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
> configuration. Repeat EIRP~1~ measurement for all directions in the
> sphere according to EIRP measurement procedure defined in Annex K.1.9
> without beam sweeping for all the points in the grid. After a
> rotation, allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for UE to
> find the best beam to use. The measuring duration is one active uplink
> subframe. EIRP~1~ is calculated considering both polarizations, theta
> and phi.
>
> 1.5 Record all the measured EIRP~1~values.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

Test procedure with uplink beam sweeping:

> 2.1 SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process
> via PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according
> to Table 6.6.1.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data

>
> 2.1a. The side conditions for SSB-based and CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
> measurements are applied as per clause 6.6.1.3.3.1.1 for PC3.

2\. 2. Set the UE in the Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP
scan as performed in Annex K.1.1. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection to
complete.

> 2\. 3. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
> uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200 msec to
> ensure that the UE transmits at its maximum output power. Allow at
> least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Tx beam selection
> to complete.
>
> 2.4. Measure UE EIRP in the Tx beam peak direction in the channel
> bandwidth of the radio access mode according to the test
> configuration. Repeat EIRP measurements for all directions in the
> sphere according to EIRP measurement procedure defined in Annex K.1.9
> with beam sweeping. After a rotation, allow at least
> BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for UE to find the best beam to use.
> The measuring duration is one active uplink subframe. EIRP is
> calculated considering both polarizations, theta and phi.

2.5. Record all the measured EIRP~2~ values.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

2.6. Calculate the ΔEIRP~BC~ = EIRP~2~ -- EIRP~1~.

2.7. Calculate a cumulative distribution function for the ΔEIRP~BC~
values.

NOTE 2: The ΔEIRP~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) computed using ΔEIRP~BC~ for each of all top
N^th^ percentile of the EIRP~2~ measurement points in the grid. When
using constant step size measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction
shall be applied, i.e., the PDF probability contribution for each
measurement point is scaled by sin(θ) or the normalized Clenshaw-Curtis
weights W(θ)/W(90^o^), introduced in Section M.4.2.1.

### 6.6.2 Enhanced Beam correspondence -- EIRP

##### 6.6.2.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-11 .H6}

To verify the UE's ability to select a suitable beam for UL transmission
based on DL measurements with or without relying on UL beam sweeping
within the range prescribed by the specified nominal maximum output
power and beam correspondence tolerance.

##### 6.6.2.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-11 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR Power Class 3 UE release 16
and forward that support CSI-RS or SSB based beam correspondence and do
not support beam correspondence without UL beam sweeping.

##### 6.6.2.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-11 .H6}

##### 6.6.2.3.1 Enhanced Beam correspondence for PC3 {#enhanced-beam-correspondence-for-pc3 .H6}

##### 6.6.2.3.1.1 General Test Coverage Rules {#general-test-coverage-rules .H6}

The beam correspondence requirement for PC3 UEs consists of three
components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as defined in clause 6.2.1.1.3.3), UE
spherical coverage (as defined in clause 6.2.1.1.3.3), and beam
correspondence tolerance (as defined in clause 6.6.1.3.3.2). The beam
correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE satisfies one of the
following conditions, depending on the UE's beam correspondence
capability IE *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*, as defined in
TS 38.306 \[26\]:

If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-3 using
the side conditions for SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.2.3.1.3.1.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet
the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-3 using
the side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.2.3.1.3.2.

If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present and
*beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16* is supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-3 with
uplink beam sweeping using the side conditions for SSB based enhanced
beam correspondence requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.2.3.1.3.1.
Such a UE shall meet the beam correspondence tolerance requirement
defined in Clause 6.6.1.3.3.2 and shall support uplink beam management,
as defined in TS 38.306 \[14\].

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present and
*beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16* is supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.3-3 with
uplink beam sweeping using the side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced
beam correspondence requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.2.3.1.3.2.
Such a UE shall meet the beam correspondence tolerance requirement
defined in Clause 6.6.1.3.3.2 and shall support uplink beam management,
as defined in TS 38.306 \[14\].

##### 6.6.2.3.1.2 Applicability rules based on support for type of enhanced beam correspondence {#applicability-rules-based-on-support-for-type-of-enhanced-beam-correspondence .H6}

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the
following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements either based
on SSB or based on CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the beam
correspondence requirements based on SSB and CSI-RS.

\- For a UE supporting either SSB based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, UE shall meet the supported enhanced beam correspondence
requirements.

\- For a UE supporting both SSB based and CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet both SSB based and CSI-RS based
enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the following
applicability rules for verifying the requirements apply:

\- The enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be verified with
the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions in clause
6.6.2.3.1.3.1

\- If the UE meets the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements using the side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.2 and meets the
minimum peak EIRP requirement as defined in clause 6.2.1.1 using the
CSI-RS based side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.1.3.2, where the link
direction is determined in the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
test, the UE is considered to have met both the SSB based and CSI-RS
based enhanced beam correspondence requirements.

\- Otherwise, if UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement as
defined in clause 6.2.1.3 using the CSI-RS based side conditions in
clause 6.6.2.3.1.3.2, the enhanced beam correspondence requirements
shall be further verified for the UE with the CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.1.3.2.

##### 6.6.2.3.3.3 Applicability {#applicability .H6}

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the
following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements either based
on SSB or based on CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the beam
correspondence requirements based on SSB and CSI-RS.

\- For a UE supporting either SSB based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet the supported enhanced beam
correspondence requirements.

\- For a UE supporting both SSB based and CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence UE shall meet the both SSB based and CSI-RS based
enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the following
applicability rules for verifying the requirements apply:

\- The enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be verified with
the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions in clause
6.6.2.3.3.3. If the UE meets the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements using the side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.3.3 and meets
the minimum peak EIRP requirement as defined in clause 6.2.1.6 using the
CSI-RS based side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.3.3.2, where the link
direction is determined in the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
test, the UE is considered to have met both the SSB based and CSI-RS
based enhanced beam correspondence requirements.

\- Otherwise, if UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement as
defined in clause 6.2.1.6 using the CSI-RS based side conditions in
clause 6.6.2.3.3.3.2, the enhanced beam correspondence requirements
shall be further verified for the UE with the CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.3.3.2.

##### 6.6.2.3.3.4 Normative reference {#normative-reference-3 .H6}

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
6.6.7.

##### 6.6.2.3.4 Enhanced Beam correspondence for PC7 {#enhanced-beam-correspondence-for-pc7 .H6}

##### 6.6.2.3.4.1 General Test Coverage Rules {#general-test-coverage-rules-1 .H6}

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 7 UEs consists of
two components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.1.3.7),
and UE spherical coverage (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.1.3.7). The beam
correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE satisfies one of the
following conditions, depending on the UE\'s beam correspondence
capability IE *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*, as defined in
TS 38.306 \[26\]:

\-- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is supported, the UE
shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.7-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.1.3.7-3 with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink
beam sweeping. Such a UE is considered to have met the beam
correspondence tolerance requirement.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.7-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.1.3.7-3 using
the side conditions for SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.2.3.4.3.1.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet
the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.7-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.7-3 using the
side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.2.3.4.3.2.

##### 6.6.2.3.4.2 Applicability rules based on support for type of enhanced beam correspondence {#applicability-rules-based-on-support-for-type-of-enhanced-beam-correspondence-1 .H6}

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the
following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements either based
on SSB or based on CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the beam
correspondence requirements based on SSB and CSI-RS.

\- For a UE supporting either SSB based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet the supported enhanced beam
correspondence requirements.

\- For a UE supporting both SSB based and CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet both SSB based and CSI-RS based
enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the following
applicability rules for verifying the requirements apply:

\- The enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be verified with
the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions in clause
6.6.2.3.4.3.1. If UE meets the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements using the side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.4.3.1 and meets
the minimum peak EIRP requirement as defined in clause 6.2.1.1.3.7 using
the CSI-RS based side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.4.3.2, where the link
direction is determined in the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
test, the UE is considered to have met both the SSB based and CSI-RS
based enhanced beam correspondence requirements.

\- Otherwise, if UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement as
defined in clause 6.2.1.1.3.7 using the CSI-RS based side conditions in
clause 6.6.2.3.4.3.2, the enhanced beam correspondence requirements
shall be further verified for the UE with the CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence side conditions in clause 6.6.2.3.4.3.2.

##### 6.6.2.3.4.3 Side Conditions {#side-conditions-1 .H6}

##### 6.6.2.3.4.3.1 Side Condition for SSB based enhanced Beam Correspondence requirements {#side-condition-for-ssb-based-enhanced-beam-correspondence-requirements-2 .H6}

7 Receiver characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

Editor's Note: Test configurations/environments that require new
spherical scan shall be included in test procedure section and
identifying such scenarios is currently FFS and owned by RAN5.

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified over
the air (OTA). The power levels for all DL signals and interferers are
defined assuming a 0 dBi reference antenna located at the centre of the
quiet zone.

For Rx test cases the identified beam peak direction can be stored and
reused for a device under test in various configurations/environments
for the full duration of device testing as long as beam peak direction
is the same.

Unless otherwise stated, Channel Bandwidth shall be prioritized in the
selecting of test points. Subcarrier spacing shall be selected after
Test Channel Bandwidth is selected.

The UE under test shall be pre-configured with UL Tx diversity schemes
disabled to account for single polarization System Simulator (SS) in the
test environment. The UE under test may transmit with dual polarization.

7.2 Diversity characteristics
-----------------------------

The minimum requirements on effective isotropic sensitivity (EIS) apply
to two measurements, corresponding to DL signals in orthogonal
polarizations.

7.3 Reference sensitivity
-------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the EIS level (total
component) at the centre of the quiet zone in the RX beam peak
direction, at which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements
for the specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.3.2 Reference sensitivity power level

Editor's note: The following aspects of the clause are for future
consideration:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power
    class other than 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7.

> The following aspects of the clause are for future consideration:

-   The 3D EIS scan test time optimization in RAN 4/ RAN 5 is FFS
    (existing EIS based test time needs to be re-evaluated for 200/266
    grid points).

-   Statistical model in Annex H.2 (currently based on LTE model) needs
    to be validated to confirm that it is also applicable for FR2

##### 7.3.2.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-13 .H6}

To verify the UE\'s ability to receive data with a given average
throughput for a specified reference measurement channel, under
conditions of low signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.

A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions
will decrease the effective coverage area of an g-NodeB.

##### 7.3.2.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-13 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of *NR* UE release 15 and forward.

##### 7.3.2.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-13 .H6}

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is defined as the EIS
level at the centre of the quiet zone in the RX beam peak direction, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

###### 7.3.2.3.1 Reference sensitivity power level for power class 1

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.2.1) with peak reference sensitivity specified in
Table 7.3.2.3.1-1. The requirement is verified with the test metric of
EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link Angle).

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR operating bands specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing are shown in
Table 7.3.2.4.1-1, Table 7.3.2.4.1-2, and Table 7.3.2.4.1-3 The details
of the uplink and downlink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are
specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3. The details of the OCNG patterns used
are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.1 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to
TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The DL and UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to
Table 7.3.2.4.1-1, Table 7.3.2.4.1-2, and Table 7.3.2.4.1-3.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in State RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 7.3.2.4.3.

##### 7.3.2.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-13 .H6}

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.3.2.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Tables 7.3.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~.

4\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIS scan as
performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE
1) for the UE Rx beam selection to complete.

5\. Perform EIS procedure as stated in Annex K.1.4 to calculate
"averaged EIS". At each power level, by changing the power level of the
wanted signal with a step size of 0.2dB (coarse and fine searches are
not precluded as long as the fine search is using the 0.2dB step size
near the sensitivity level). For each power step measure the average
throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance
according to Annex H.2. The downlink power step size shall be no more
than 0.2 dB when the RF power level is near the sensitivity level.

6\. Compare the dB value of the "averaged EIS" value corresponding to
the Rx beam peak direction identified in step 5 to the test requirement
in Table 7.3.2.5-1 to Table 7.3.2.5-4. If the EIS value is lower or
equal to the value in Table 7.3.2.5-1 to Table 7.3.2.5-4, pass the UE.
Otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

##### 7.3.2.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-12 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 7.3.2.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-11 .H6}

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.2.1) with peak reference sensitivity specified in Tables 7.3.2.5-1
to 7.3.2.5-4. The requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS
(Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link Angle).

### 7.3.4 EIS spherical coverage

Editor's Note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power
    class 2, 4 and 6.

##### 7.3.4.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-14 .H6}

To verify that the EIS spherical coverage of the UE receiver is
acceptable under conditions of low signal level, ideal propagation and
no added noise.

##### 7.3.4.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-14 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of *NR* UE release 15 and forward.

##### 7.3.4.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-14 .H6}

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS at a single grid point of
the spherical grid is the minimum mean power applied to each one of the
UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at which the throughput shall
meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement
channel.

The reference measurement channels and throughput criterion shall be as
specified in section 7.3.2.3.

For power class 1, the maximum EIS at the 85^th^ percentile of the CCDF
of EIS measured over the full sphere around the UE is defined as the
spherical coverage requirement and is found in Table 7.3.4.3-1 below.
The requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=Spherical
coverage grid, Meas=Link angle).

For power class 3, the maximum EIS at the 50^th^ percentile of the CCDF
of EIS measured over the full sphere around the UE is defined as the
spherical coverage requirement and is found in Table 7.3.4.3-3 below.
The requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=Spherical
coverage grid, Meas=Link angle).

For power class 3, the UEs that support operation in multiple FR2 bands,
the minimum requirement for EIS spherical coverage in Table 7.3.4.3-3
shall be increased per band, respectively, by the reference sensitivity
relaxation parameter ∑MB~S~ and ∆MB~S,n~ as specified in Table
7.3.2.3.3-1a and 7.3.2.3.3-1b..

Unless given by Table 7.3.4.3-7, the minimum requirements specified in
Table 7.3.4.3-1, Table 7.3.4.3-2, Table 7.3.4.3-3, Table 7.3.4.3-4,
Table 7.3.4.3-5, Table 7.3.4.3-6 and Table 7.3.4.3-7 shall be verified

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation, the minimum
requirement for reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.4.3-1, Table
7.3.4.3-2, Table 7.3.4.3-3, Table 7.3.4.3-4, Table 7.3.4.3-5, Table

ΔR~IB,P,n~ defined in subclause 7.3A.2.0.3 for the applicable operating
bands.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
7.3.4.

##### 7.3.4.4 Test description {#test-description-13 .H6}

##### 7.3.4.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-14 .H6}

Same initial conditions as in clause 7.3.2.4.1 except that only normal
condition is tested.

##### 7.3.4.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-14 .H6}

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.3.2.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Tables 7.3.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~.

4\. Measure UE EIS value for each grid point according to EIS spherical
coverage procedure defined in Annex K.1.6.0, and obtain a Complimentary
Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of all EIS dBm values.
Alternatively, UE EIS measurement for each grid point could be done
according to Rx Fast spherical coverage procedure defined in Annex
K.1.6.1. After a rotation, allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE
1) for UE to find the best beam to use. EIS is calculated considering
both polarizations, theta and phi.

5\. Identify the EIS dBm value corresponding to %-tile (UE power class
dependent) value in the applicable test requirement table in section
7.3.4.5.

6\. Compare the EIS dBm value identified in step 5, to the limit value
in the applicable test requirement table in section 7.3.4.5. If the EIS
dBm value is lower or equal to the limit value, pass the UE. Otherwise
fail the UE.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

##### 7.3.4.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-13 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 7.3.4.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-12 .H6}

The reference measurement channels and throughput criterion shall be as
specified in section 7.3.2.5.

7.3A Reference sensitivity for CA
---------------------------------

### 7.3A.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS for both Intra-band
non-contiguous CA and Intra-band contiguous CA is defined as the EIS
level at the centre of the quiet zone in the RX beam peak direction
\[(same as that found for single carrier scenario in clause 7.3.2)\], at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.3A.2 Reference sensitivity power level for CA

#### 7.3A.2.0 Minimum Conformance Requirements

##### 7.3A.2.0.1 Intra-band contiguous CA

For each component carrier in the intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation, the throughput in QPSK R = 1/3 shall be ≥ 95 % of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annex A (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal)
with peak reference sensitivity values determined from section 7.3.2.3,
and relaxation applied to peak reference sensitivity requirement as
specified in Table 7.3A.2.0.1-1.

Table 7.3A.2.0.1-1: ΔR~IB~ EIS Relaxation for CA operation by aggregated
channel bandwidth

  Aggregated Channel BW 'BW~Channel\_CA~' (MHz)   ΔR~IB~ (dB)
  ----------------------------------------------- -------------
  BW~Channel\_CA~ **≤ 800**                       **0.0**
  **800 \<** BW~Channel\_CA~ **≤ 1200**           **0.5**
  **1200 \<** BW~Channel\_CA~ **≤ 1600**          **1.0**
  **1600 \<** BW~Channel\_CA~ **≤ 2000**          **1.5**

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
7.3A.2.1.

##### 7.3A.2.0.2 Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For each component carrier in the intra-band non-contiguous carrier
aggregation, the throughput in QPSK R=1/3 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal) with
peak reference sensitivity values determined from section 7.3.2.3, and
relaxation applied to peak reference sensitivity requirement as
specified in Table 7.3A.2.0.2-1. The configured downlink spectrum is
defined as the frequency band from the lowest edge of the lowest CC to
the upper edge of the highest CC of all DL configured CCs.

Table 7.3A.2.0.2-1: ΔR~IB~ EIS Relaxation for CA operation by cumulative
aggregated channel bandwidth

  Cumulative Aggregated Channel BW (MHz)   ΔR~IB~ (dB)
  ---------------------------------------- -------------
  ≤ 800                                    0.0
  \> 800 and ≤ 1400                        0.5
  **\> 1400** and **≤ 2400**               **1.5**

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
7.3A.2.2.

##### 7.3A.2.0.3 Inter-band CA

The inter-band requirement applies for all active component carriers.
The throughput for each component carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1) with peak reference
sensitivity for each carrier specified in section 7.3.2, and relaxation
**ΔR~IB,P,n~** applied to peak reference sensitivity requirement.
**ΔR~IB,P,n~** is specified in Table 7.3A.2.0.3-1. The requirement on
each component carrier shall be met when the power in the component
carrier in the other band is set to its EIS spherical coverage
requirement for inter-band CA specified in sub-clause 7.3A.3.3.

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation,
the intra-band CA relaxation, ΔR~IB~, is also applied according to the
clause 7.3A.2.1 and 7.3A.2.2.

  **CA\_n260-n261**   **n260**      **2.5**               **3.5**
                      **n261**      **2.5**               **3.5**

#### 7.3A.2.1 Reference sensitivity power level for CA (2DL CA)

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz and for intra-band
    non-contiguous CA are TBD.

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power
    class other than 1, 3, 5.

-   In case of frequency separation larger than 800 MHz and in case the
    device manufacturer does not explicitly declare that the beam peak
    for a reference (frequency band, CBW) or (frequency band
    combination, CA BW class) is applicable for a group of other
    intra-band contiguous combinations and CA BW classes, according to
    Table A.4.3.9-6 in 38.508-2, following aspect of beam peak search
    procedures for CA is FFS: RB allocation, power level, channel
    bandwidth configuration, per CC approach or all CC combined
    approach, etc

-   Some references are in square brackets for inter-band DL CA

##### 7.3A.2.1.1 Test purpose {#a.2.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

Same test purpose as in clause 7.3.2.1.

##### 7.3A.2.1.2 Test applicability {#a.2.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 2DL CA.

##### 7.3A.2.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.2.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

Same minimum conformance requirements as in clause 7.3A.2.0.

##### 7.3A.2.1.4 Test description {#a.2.1.4-test-description .H6}

##### 7.3A.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.2.1.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR CA configurations specified in clause 5.5A. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing are shown in
Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-1, Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-2 and Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-3. The
details of the uplink and downlink reference measurement channels (RMCs)
are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3. The details of the OCNG patterns
used are specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.1 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to
TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
7.3A.2.1.4.1-1, Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-2 and Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-3.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in State RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 7.3A.2.1.4.3.

##### 7.3A.2.1.4.2 Test Procedure {#a.2.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

Test procedure for Intra-band:

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 7.3A.2.1.4.3.

3\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321\[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.2).

4\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information on PCC for each UL HARQ
process via PDCCH DCI format \[0\_1\] for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to
send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~.

7\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIS scan as
performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE
1) for the UE Rx beam selection to complete.

8\. For each component carrier, perform EIS procedure as stated in Annex
K.1.4 to calculate "averaged EIS" by changing the power level of the
wanted signal with a step size of 0.2dB, while increasing the power
level of each component carrier other than the one being tested by a
fixed offset of 5 dB compared to the current power level of the
component carrier under test. Coarse and fine searches are not precluded
as long as the fine search is using the 0.2dB step size near the
sensitivity level. For each power step measure the average throughput
for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according
to Annex H.2.

9\. For each component carrier, compare the dB value of the "averaged
EIS" value corresponding to the Rx beam peak direction (same as that
found for single carrier in clause 7.3.2) identified in step 8 to the
test requirement in Tables 7.3A.2.1.5-4 to Table 7.3A.2.1.5-7. If the
EIS value is lower or equal to the value in Tables 7.3A.2.1.5-4 to Table
7.3A.2.1.5-7, pass the UE. Otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

Test procedure for Inter-band:

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 7.3A.2.1.4.3.

3\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer TS
38.321\[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds (Refer
TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.2).

4\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information on PCC for each UL HARQ
process via PDCCH DCI format \[0\_1\] for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.3A.2.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to
send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach PUMAX.

7\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found for the primary
component carrier with a 3D EIS scan as performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow
at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Rx beam selection
to complete.

8\. Set downlink signal level for each component carrier equal to EIS
spherical coverage values for each band in inter-band CA which are those
in clause 7.3.4.5 corrected with ∆RIB,S,n defined in 7.3A.3.0.3-1.

9\. For primary component carrier, perform EIS procedure as stated in
Annex K.1.4 to calculate "averaged EIS" by changing the power level of
the wanted signal with a step size of 0.2dB, while increasing the power
level of each component carrier other than the one being tested by a
fixed offset of 5 dB compared to the current power level of the
component carrier under test. Coarse and fine searches are not precluded
as long as the fine search is using the 0.2dB step size near the
sensitivity level. For each power step measure the average throughput
for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according
to Annex H.2.

10\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found for the secondary
component carrier with a 3D EIS scan as performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow
at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Rx beam selection
to complete.

11\. Set downlink signal level for each component carrier equal to EIS
spherical coverage values for each band in inter-band CA which are those
in clause 7.3.4.5 corrected with ∆RIB,S,n defined in 7.3A.3.0.3-1.

12\. For secondary component carrier, perform EIS procedure as stated in
Annex K.1.4 to calculate "averaged EIS" by changing the power level of
the wanted signal with a step size of 0.2dB, while increasing the power
level of each component carrier other than the one being tested by a
fixed offset of 5 dB compared to the current power level of the
component carrier under test. Coarse and fine searches are not precluded
as long as the fine search is using the 0.2dB step size near the
sensitivity level. For each power step measure the average throughput
for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according
to Annex H.2.

13\. Compare the dB value of the "averaged EIS" values identified in
steps 9 and 12 to the test requirement in Tables 7.3.2.5-1 to Table
7.3.2.5-4 for the corresponding frequency band and power class. If the
EIS values are lower or equal to the values in Tables 7.3.2.5-1 to Table
7.3.2.5-4, pass the UE. Otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 7.3A.2.1.5 Test requirement {#a.2.1.5-test-requirement .H6}

For each component carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex
A.2 and A.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5) with peak reference sensitivity
specified in Tables 7.3A.2.1.5-4 to 7.3A.2.1.5-7. The requirement is
verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction,
Meas=Link Angle).

##### 7.3A.3.0.3 EIS spherical coverage for inter-band CA

The inter-band CA requirement applies per operating band, for all active
component carriers with UL assigned to one band and one DL component
carrier per band. The requirement on each component carrier shall be met
when the power in the component carrier in the other band is set to its
EIS spherical coverage requirement for inter-band CA specified in this
sub-clause.

The inter-band CA spherical coverage requirement for each power class
will be satisfied if the intersection set of spherical coverage areas
exceeds the common coverage requirement. Intersection set of spherical
coverage areas is defined as a fraction of area of full sphere measured
around the UE where both bands meet their defined individual EIS
spherical coverage requirements for inter-band CA operation. The common
coverage requirement is determined as \<100-percentile rank\> %, where
'percentile rank' is the percentile value in the specification of
spherical coverage for that power class from clause 7.3.4.The
requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=Beam peak
search grids, Meas=Link angle).

The reference measurement channels and throughput criterion shall be as
specified in clause 7.3A.2.0.3. The requirement shall be met for an
uplink transmission using QPSK DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in clause
7.3.2.

Unless otherwise specified, the minimum requirements for reference
sensitivity shall be verified with the network signalling value NS\_200
(Table 6.2.3.3.1-1) configured.

The required spherical coverage EIS for each band in inter-band CA
operation is given in clause 7.3.4 and modified by ΔR~IB,S,n~. The value
of ∆R~IB,S,n~ is defined in Table 7.3A.3.0.3-1.

##### 7.3A.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.3.1.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR CA configurations specified in clause 5.5A. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing are shown in
Table \[TBD\], Table \[TBD\] and Table \[TBD\]. The details of the
uplink and downlink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified
in Annexes A.2 and A.3. The details of the OCNG patterns used are
specified in Annex A.5. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before
measurement are specified in Annex C.2.

FFS

##### 7.3A.3.1.4.2 Test procedure {#a.3.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 7.3A.3.1.4.3.

3\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321\[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.2).

4\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.3A.3.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.3A.3.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~.

7\. Set downlink signal level of each component carrier other than the
one being tested equal to its EIS spherical coverage requirement for
inter-band CA specified in 7.3A.3.0.3.

8\. For each component carrier, measure UE EIS value for each grid point
according to EIS spherical coverage procedure defined in Annex K.1.6.0,
and obtain a Complimentary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of
all EIS dBm values. Alternatively, UE EIS measurement for each grid
point could be done according to Rx Fast spherical coverage procedure
defined in Annex K.1.6.1. After a rotation, allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for UE to find the best beam to use.
EIS is calculated considering both polarizations, theta and phi.

9\. Identify the EIS dBm value corresponding to %-tile (UE power class
dependent) value in the applicable test requirement tables in section
7.3A.3.1.5.

10\. Compare the EIS dBm value identified in step 5, to the limit value
in the applicable test requirement tables in section 7.3A.3.1.5. If the
EIS dBm value is lower or equal to the limit value, pass the UE.
Otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

##### 7.3A.3.1.4.3 Message contents {#a.3.1.4.3-message-contents .H6}

Same as 7.3.4.4.3

##### 7.3A.3.1.5 Test requirement {#a.3.1.5-test-requirement .H6}

The reference measurement channels and throughput criterion shall be as
specified in section 7.3.2.5.

7.3K Spherical coverage requirement for simultaneous reception from multiple directions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.3K.1 Spherical coverage with two Angle of Arrivals (AoAs) with simultaneous reception from multiple directions

#### 7.3K.1.0 General

For this release, the requirement applies only to FR2-1 UEs that support
the following set of capabilities:

1\. simultaneousReceptionDiffTypeD-r16

2\. At least one of:

a\. singleDCI-SDM-scheme-r16 or

b\. multiDCI-MultiTRP-r16 and either of:

i\. overlapPDSCHsFullyFreqTime-r16.

ii\. overlapPDSCHsInTimePartiallyFreq-r16

The requirement applies for simultaneous reception of rank 2 PDSCH,
where each layer uses overlapping RBs in both time and frequency and is
associated with a unique TCI state and AoA. The scheduled TCI states for
the rank 2 PDSCH shall be configured with different QCL type-D reference
signals respectively. The DL power at the centre of quiet zone from each
AoA equals the EIS spherical coverage requirement from sub-clause 7.3.4.

For UEs supporting *singleDCI-SDM-scheme-r16,* the cumulative throughput
in the DL associated with both TCI-states shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified A.3.3.2-5
and A.3.3.2-6 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1).

For UEs supporting *multiDCI-MultiTRP-r16*, the throughput in the DL
associated with each TCI-state shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified A.3.3.2-1 and
A.3.3.2-2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1).

The requirement shall be met for an uplink transmission using QPSK
DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink transmission bandwidth less than or
equal to the downlink transmission bandwidth. The UL is assigned to any
one of the two TCI-states scheduled for simultaneous DL, with reference
measurement channel as specified in Annex A.2.3.2. The transmitter shall
be set to PUMAX as defined in clause 6.2.4.

Unless otherwise specified, the minimum requirements shall be verified
with the network signalling value NS\_200 (Table 6.2.3.1-1) configured.

#### 7.3K.1.1 UE spherical coverage for simultaneous reception from multiple directions (2 AoAs)

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

\- . Some references within initial conditions shall be updated

\- Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for all power
classes.

\- Test Methodology is FFS for Power Class 6

\- Test Procedure details for 2AoA reception and measurements is FFS

\- Test Requirements is FFS

##### 7.3K.1.1.1 Test purpose {#k.1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

\[To verify that the UE meets the spherical coverage requirements when
receiving downlink from two directions or angle of arrivals\].

##### 7.3K.1.1.2 Test applicability {#k.1.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of release 18 and forward NR UEs
that support *simultaneousReceptionDiffTypeD-r16* and at least one of At
least one of:

a\. singleDCI-SDM-scheme-r16 or

b\. multiDCI-MultiTRP-r16 and either of:

i\. overlapPDSCHsFullyFreqTime-r16.

ii\. overlapPDSCHsInTimePartiallyFreq-r16

##### 7.3K.1.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#k.1.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

##### 7.3K.1.1.3.1 2AoA spherical coverage for power class 3 {#k.1.1.3.1-2aoa-spherical-coverage-for-power-class-3 .H6}

The requirements apply to the UE when tested in a test system as
described in Annex L. The requirement is verified with the test metric
of throughput (Link= 2AoA spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link Angle).

The spherical coverage requirement for simultaneous reception from
multiple directions is defined in terms of the probability to support
simultaneous reception of rank 2 PDSCH defined in sub-clause 7.3K.0. The
probability (see Annex L) is defined as the spatial average over the
full sphere around the UE of the probability of any one direction to
support 2 AoA reception. In the applicable test system (see Annex L),
the probability of any one direction of the UE to support 2 AoA
reception for any specific AoA separation is the ratio of the number of
unique AoA pairs that include that direction and can support 2 AoA
reception to the total number of verified unique AoA pairs that include
that direction.

The requirement applies only for the UE's declared orientation in the
positioner of the test system. The requirement for each AoA separation
condition applies only for the UE's declared orientation in the
positioner of the test system for that AoA separation. The minimum
required overall probability to support 2 AoA reception for power class
3 UEs for any channel bandwidth is specified by AoA separation in table
7.3K.3-1. The UE is only required to fulfil the requirement at any one
of AoA separations declared from Table 7.3K.3-1.

##### 7.3K.1.1.3.2 2AoA spherical coverage for power class 6 {#k.1.1.3.2-2aoa-spherical-coverage-for-power-class-6 .H6}

The requirements for a power class 6 UE are applicable with network
signalling *highSpeedDeploymentTypeFR2-r17* configured as
*bidirectional*. UE spherical coverage evaluation areas are found in
Table 6.2.1.6-3a in clause 6.2.1.6, by consisting of Area-1 and Area-2,
in the reference coordinate system in Annex L.1. If one AoA is within
Area-1 and another AoA is within Area-2, the 2AoA spherical coverage
requirements apply with DL power specified in Table 7.3K.6-1 for the
PDSCH of each AoA. For any AoA pair selected from Area-1 and Area-2,
respectively, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels. The requirement is verified with
a 150° angular separation between 2AoAs. The requirement is verified
with the test metric of Throughput (Link=2AoA Spherical coverage grid,
Meas=Link angle).

The requirement shall be met for an uplink transmission using QPSK
DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink transmission bandwidth less than or
equal to that specified in Table 7.3.2.1-2.

Unless given by Table 7.3.2.1-3, the minimum requirements for 2AoA
spherical coverage shall be verified with the network signalling value
NS\_200 (Table 6.2.3.1-1) configured.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
7.3K.6.

##### 7.3K.1.1.4 Test description {#k.1.1.4-test-description .H6}

##### 7.3K.1.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#k.1.1.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths based on NR operating bands
specified in Table \[TBD\]. All of these configurations shall be tested
with applicable test parameters for each channel bandwidth and
subcarrier spacing, are shown in Table \[TBD\]. The details of the
uplink reference measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes
\[TBD\]. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are
specified in Annex C.2.

The test configuration table is same as Table 7.3.2.4.1-1

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure \[TBD\] for TE diagram and Figure \[TBD\] for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause \[TBD\].

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
\[TBD\].

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 6.2.1.1.4.3

##### 7.3K.1.1.4.2 Test procedure {#k.1.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

Editor's note: Test procedure needs further modifications to account for
2AoA throughput measurements to verify the spherical coverage
requirement.

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.3.2.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Tables 7.3.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200msec for the
UE to reach P~UMAX~.

4\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIS scan as
performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE
1) for the UE Rx beam selection to complete.

5\. FFS on how to accurately introduce the 2 downlink signals from AoA1
and AoA2 on the selected polarization combination at each grid point.

6\. FFS several steps on the throughput measurements on AoA1 and AoA2
for both mDCI and sDCI scenarios. The measurements have to be performed
at each grid point.

7\. Calculate and record the multi-Rx reception RF performance result
for the polarization combinations \[TBD\] including area weights \[TBD\]

8\. Calculate and perform the final multi-Rx reception RF performance
metric as defined in test requirement. FFS - Details of metric need to
be added here.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

##### 7.3K.1.1.4.3 Message contents {#k.1.1.4.3-message-contents .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with

FFS

7.4 Maximum input level
-----------------------

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Measurement uncertainty is FFS.

-   UL power level configuration is TBD.

-   Relaxation of DL power for 256 QAM is FFS

##### 7.4.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-15 .H6}

Maximum input level tests the UE\'s ability to receive data with a given
average throughput for a specified reference measurement channel, under
conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise.

A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these conditions
will decrease the coverage area near to a g-NodeB.

##### 7.4.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-15 .H6}

The minimum conformance requirements in this test case are not testable
due to maximum input level unachievable in IFF OTA test setup. Other
test setups have not been analysed. Thus the test case will not be
tested as part of UE conformance testing.

NOTE: This does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other
purposes if deemed useful to all types of NR UEs release 15 and forward.

##### 7.4.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-15 .H6}

The maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power, for which
the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

The maximum input level is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode in the direction where peak
gain is achieved.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annex A (with one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1)
with parameters specified in Table 7.4.3-1. The requirement is verified
with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link
angle).

##### 7.4.4 Test description {#test-description-14 .H6}

##### 7.4.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-15 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR operating bands specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and sub-carrier spacing, are shown in
Table 7.4.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMC) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3. The
details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex A.5.
Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in
Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.1 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The DL and UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to
Table 7.4.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 7.4.4.3.

##### 7.4.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-15 .H6}

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.4.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.4.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

3\. Set the Downlink signal level for θ-polarization to the value as
defined in Table 7.4.5-1.

4\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIS scan as
performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE)
for the UE Rx beam selection to complete.

5\. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
\[TBD\] dB of the target power level in Table 7.4.5-1, for at least the
duration of the throughput measurement.

6\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Rx Only.

7\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.

8\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

9\. Repeat steps from 3 to 8, for the downlink signal from
φ-polarization.

10\. Compare the results for both the θ-polarization and φ-polarization
against the requirement. If either result meets the requirements, pass
the UE.

NOTE: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

##### 7.4.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-14 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 7.4.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-13 .H6}

The throughput measurement derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annex A with parameters specified in Tables 7.4.5-1.

7.4A Maximum input level for CA
-------------------------------

### 7.4A.0 Minimum Conformance Requirements

#### 7.4A.0.1 Maximum input level for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the input level is defined
as the cumulative received power, summed over the transmission bandwidth
configurations of each active DL CC. All DL CCs shall be active
throughout the test. The input power shall be distributed among the
active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with each other. At the maximum
input level, the specified relative throughput shall meet or exceed the
minimum requirements for the specified reference measurement channel
over each component carrier. The minimum requirement is specified in
Table 7.4A.0.1-1.

The maximum input level is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode in the direction where peak
gain is achieved. The requirement is verified with the test metric of
EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

+-----------------------------------------+-----------+--------------+

#### 7.4A.0.2 Maximum input level for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation the requirement of
clause 7.4A.0.1 applies.

#### 7.4A.0.3 Maximum input level for inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the maximum input
level is defined with the uplink active on the band other than the band
whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements
specified in clause 7.4 for each component carrier while all downlink
carriers are active.

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation and
uplink carrier(s) assigned to one NR band, the requirement is defined
with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is
being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in clause
7.4A.1 and 7.4A.2 for each band while all downlink carriers are active.

### 7.4A.1 Maximum input level for CA (2DL CA)

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Measurement uncertainty and test requirement are FFS.

-   UL power level configuration is TBD.

-   Relaxation of DL power for 256 QAM is FFS.

-   Test for DL intra-band non-contiguous configurations with UL
    intra-band contiguous configuration is FFS.

##### 7.4A.1.1 Test purpose {#a.1.1-test-purpose .H6}

Same test purpose as in clause 7.4.1.

##### 7.4A.1.2 Test applicability {#a.1.2-test-applicability .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UEs release 15 and forward
that support FR2 2DL CA.

The minimum conformance requirements in this test case are not testable
due to maximum input level unachievable in IFF OTA test setup. Other
test setups have not been analysed. Thus the test case will not be
tested as part of UE conformance testing.

NOTE: This does not preclude the test from being used for R&D or other
purposes if deemed useful to all types of NR UEs release 15 and forward
that support FR2 2DL CA.

##### 7.4A.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements .H6}

Same minimum conformance requirements as in clause 7.4A.0.

##### 7.4A.1.4 Test description {#a.1.4-test-description .H6}

##### 7.4A.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.1.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR CA configurations specified in clause 5.5A. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and sub-carrier spacing, are shown in
Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMC) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3. The
details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex A.5.
Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in
Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.1 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to
TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The DL and UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to
Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in State RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 7.4A.1.4.3.

##### 7.4A.1.4.2 Test Procedure {#a.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}

Test procedure for Intra-band:

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 7.4A.1.4.3.

3\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321\[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.2).

4\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Set the Downlink signal level for θ-polarization to the value as
defined in Table 7.4A.1.5-1.

7\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIS scan as
performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE)
for the UE Rx beam selection to complete.

8\. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
\[TBD\] dB of the target power level in Table 7.4A.1.5-1, for at least
the duration of the throughput measurement.

9\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Rx Only.

10\. For each component carrier, ensure the average throughput for a
duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to
Annex H.2.

11\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

12\. Repeat steps from 3 to 8, for the downlink signal from
φ-polarization.

13\. Compare the results for both the θ-polarization and φ-polarization
against the requirement. If either result meets the requirements, pass
the UE.

NOTE: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

Test procedure for Inter-band:

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 7.4A.1.4.3.

3\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer TS
38.321\[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds (Refer
TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.2).

4\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information on PCC for each UL HARQ
process via PDCCH DCI format \[0\_1\] for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.4A.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to
send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Set SS with the downlink signal applied to the θ-polarization of the
measurement antenna.

7\. Set the UE in the SCC Rx beam peak direction found for the primary
component carrier with a 3D EIS scan as performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow
at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Rx beam selection
to complete.

8\. Set downlink signal level for θ-polarization values described in
7.4.5-1 for SCC.

9\. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
\[TBD\] dB of the target power level in Table 7.4A.1.5-1, for at least
the duration of the throughput measurement.

10\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Rx Only.

11\. For SCC, measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient
to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2.

12\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

13\. Repeat steps from 3 to 12, for the downlink signal from
φ-polarization.

14\. Repeat steps 3 to 13 switching PCC and SCC test frequencies.

15\. Compare the throughput results for both the θ-polarization and
φ-polarization for each component carrier against the requirement. If
either result, θ-polarization and φ-polarization, for each component
carrier meet the requirements, pass the UE.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2

##### 7.4A.1.4.3 Message contents {#a.1.4.3-message-contents .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 7.4A.1.5 Test requirement {#a.1.5-test-requirement .H6}

The throughput measurement derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annex A with parameters specified in Tables 7.4A.1.5-1.

The UE shall meet the requirements specified for each band while all
downlink carriers are active.

7.4D Maximum input level for UL MIMO
------------------------------------

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
7.4D.

No test case details are specified. Given UE's Rx performance would not
be impacted by the Tx configuration on TDD bands, the requirements in
this test case can be well covered in 7.4 and don't need to be tested
again.

7.5 Adjacent channel selectivity
--------------------------------

> Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
> determined:

\- Measurement Uncertainty is FFS for power classes other than 1, 3, 5
and 6.

\- The minimum conformance requirements for Case 2 in this test case are
not testable due to maximum input level unachievable in IFF OTA test
setup. Other test setups have not been analysed.

\- For power class 1, if testing were extended beyond 100MHz, potential
relaxation required is FFS.

##### 7.5.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-16 .H6}

Adjacent channel selectivity tests the UE's ability to receive data with
a given average throughput for a specified reference measurement
channel, in the presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given
frequency offset from the centre frequency of the assigned channel,
under conditions of ideal propagation and no added noise.

##### 7.5.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-16 .H6}

This test applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward.

##### 7.5.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-16 .H6}

Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive a NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence
of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the
centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

The requirement applies at the Radiated Interface Boundary (RIB) when
the AoA of the incident wave of the wanted signal and the interfering
signal are both from the direction where peak gain is achieved.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations,
under the assumption of polarization match.

The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5.3-1
for all values of an adjacent channel interferer up to --25 dBm.
However, it is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the
lower and upper range of test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5.3-2 and
Table 7.5.3-3 where the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2, with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1. The requirement is verified
with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link
angle).

##### 7.5.4 Test description {#test-description-15 .H6}

##### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-16 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, and test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing
based on NR operating bands specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing, are shown in
Table 7.5.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3. The
details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex A.5.
Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in
Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.2 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The DL and UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to
Table 7.5.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message contents are defined in clause 7.5.4.3.

##### 7.5.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-16 .H6}

1\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Rx beam selection to complete.

2\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.5.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

3\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.5.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload data to send, the UE
transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

4\. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as
-MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power
level in Table 7.5.5-2 (Case 1, PC3) or Table 7.5.5-2a (Case 1, PC1) or
Table 7.5.5-3 (Case 2), for at least the duration of the throughput
measurement, where:

-   MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is
    specified in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the
    channel bandwidth BW.

-   Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) + 1dB
    (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
    uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS
    38.101-2 \[3\], Table 6.3.4.3-2 and is 1dB for 1dB power step size,
    and the Test system relative power measurement uncertainty is
    specified in Table F.1.3-1.

5\. Perform Blocking measurement procedure as stated in Annex K.1.8
using Downlink signal level and Interferer signal level as defined in
Table 7.5.5-2 (Case 1, PC3) or Table 7.5.5-2a (Case 1, PC1). Modulated
interferer signal characteristics as defined in Annex D with frequency
below the wanted signal. Measure throughput for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2.

6\. Repeat step 5 using an interfering signal frequency above the wanted
signal in Case 1.

7\. Repeat for applicable channel bandwidths and operating band
combinations in Case 1.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

##### 7.5.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-15 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 7.5.5 Test requirements {#test-requirements-2 .H6}

The requirement below shall only be considered if UE output power
measured in the test procedure step 4 ends within the Uplink power
control window.

The throughput measurement derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annex A, under the conditions specified in Table 7.5.5-2,
Table 7.5.5-2a, and Table 7.5.5-2b.

7.5A Adjacent channel selectivity for CA
----------------------------------------

### 7.5A.0 Minimum Conformance Requirements

#### 7.5A.0.1 Adjacent channel selectivity for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the SCC(s) shall be
configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The input power shall
be distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with
each other. The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in
Table 7.5A.0.1-1 for an adjacent channel interferer on either side of
the aggregated downlink signal at a specified frequency offset and for
an interferer power up to -25 dBm.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2
and A.3.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1). The requirement is verified
with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link
angle).

#### 7.5A.0.2 Adjacent channel selectivity for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two component
carriers, two different requirements apply for out-of-gap and in-gap.
For out-of-gap, the UE shall meet the requirements for each component
carrier as specified in clauses 7.5. For in-gap, the requirement applies
if the following minimum gap condition is met:

∆*f~ACS~* ≥ BW~1~/2 + BW~2~/2 + max(BW~1~, BW~2~),

where ∆*f~ACS~* *is the f*requency separation between the centre
frequencies of the component carriers and BW*~k~* are the channel
bandwidths of carrier *k*, *k* = 1,2.

If the minimum gap condition is met, the UE shall meet the requirements
specified in clauses 7.5 for each component carrier considered. The
respective channel bandwidth of the component carrier under test will be
used in the parameter calculations of the requirement. In case of more
than two component carriers, the minimum gap condition is computed for
any pair of adjacent component carriers following the same approach as
the two component carriers. The in-gap requirement for the corresponding
pairs shall apply if the minimum gap condition is met.

For every component carrier to which the requirements apply, the UE
shall meet the requirement with one active interferer signal (in-gap or
out-of-gap) while all downlink carriers are active and the input power
shall be distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned
with each other.

#### 7.5A.0.3 Adjacent channel selectivity for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the adjacent
channel requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.5 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation and
uplink carrier(s) assigned to one NR band, the requirement is defined
with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is
being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in clauses
7.5A.1 and 7.5A.2 for each band while all downlink carriers are active.

7.5D Adjacent channel selectivity for UL MIMO
---------------------------------------------

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
7.5D.

No test case details are specified. Given UE's Rx performance would not
be impacted by the Tx configuration on TDD bands, the requirements in
this test case can be well covered in 7.5 and don't need to be tested
again.

7.6 Blocking characteristics
----------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver's ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the spurious response or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted
input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver
beyond a specified limit. The blocking performance shall apply at all
frequencies except those at which a spurious response occurs.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
the wanted signal and the interfering signal are both from the direction
where peak gain is achieved.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations,
under the assumption of polarization match.

### 7.6.2 In-band blocking

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   Measurement uncertainty is FFS for power classes other than 1, 3, 5
    > and 6.

-   For power class 1, if testing were extended beyond 100MHz, potential
    relaxation required is FFS.

##### 7.6.2.0 General {#general-7 .H6}

In-band blocking is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive a NR
signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
interferer at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency of the
assigned channel.

##### 7.6.2.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-17 .H6}

In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling
into the UE receive band or into the spectrum equivalent to twice the
channel bandwidth below or above the UE receive band at which the
relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum requirement for the
specified measurement channels.

##### 7.6.2.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-17 .H6}

This test applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward.

##### 7.6.2.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-17 .H6}

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2 (with
one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described
in Annex A.5.2.1). The requirement is verified with the test metric of
EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

##### 7.6.2.4 Test description {#test-description-16 .H6}

##### 7.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-17 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR operating bands specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and sub-carrier spacing, are shown in
Table 7.6.2.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMC) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3.
Configuration of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in
Annex C.2. The details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex
A.5.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.2 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The DL and UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to
Table 7.6.2.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38-508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message content are defined in clause 7.6.2.4.3.

##### 7.6.2.4.2 Test procedure  {#test-procedure-17 .H6}

1\. Set the UE in the Rx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP scan
as performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
(NOTE 1) for the UE Rx beam selection to complete.

2\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.6.2.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

3\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0\_1 for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6.2.4.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to
send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

4\. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as
-MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power
level in Table 7.6.2.5-1, for at least the duration of the throughput
measurement, where:

\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is
specified in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel
bandwidth BW.

\- Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) + 1dB (UE
power step tolerance) ) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS
38.101-2 \[3\], Table 6.3.4.3-2 and is 1dB for 1dB power step size, and
the Test system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in
Table F.1.3-1.

5\. Perform Blocking measurement procedure as stated in Annex K.1.8
using Downlink signal level and Interferer signal level as defined in
Table 7.6.2.5-1. Modulated interferer signal characteristics as defined
in Annex D. Measure throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.

6\. Repeat step 5 using interfering signals specified in 7.6.2.5-1. The
ranges are covered in steps equal to the interferer bandwidth.
Interferer frequencies should be chosen starting with an offset nearest
to the centre frequency and sweep outwards towards the band edges. In
order to ensure that full range is tested for interferer frequency, run
last test steps at frequency equal to F~Interferer~ range limit defined
at the corresponding band edge.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2.

##### 7.6A.2.0.1 In-band blocking for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the SCC(s) shall be
configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The input power shall
be distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with
each other. The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in
Table 7.6A.2.0.1-1 for in the presence of an interferer at a given
frequency offset from the centre frequency of the assigned channel and
an interferer power shall not exceed -25 dBm. The throughput of each
carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2 (with
one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described
in Annex A.5.2.1). The requirement is verified with the test metric of
EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

##### 7.6A.2.0.2 In-band blocking for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two component
carriers, the requirement applies to out-of-gap and in-gap. For
out-of-gap, the UE shall meet the requirements for each component
carrier with parameters as specified in Table 7.6.2.3-1. The requirement
associated to the maximum channel between across the component carriers
is selected. For in-gap, the requirement shall apply if the following
minimum gap condition is met:

∆*f~IBB~* ≥ 0.5(BW~1~ + BW~2~) + 2 max(BW~1~, BW~2~),

where ∆*f~IBB~ is the f*requency separation between the centre
frequencies of the component carriers and BW*~k~* are the channel
bandwidths of carrier *k*, *k* = 1,2.

If the minimum gap condition is met, the UE shall meet the requirement
specified in Table 7.6.2.3-1 for each component carrier. The respective
channel bandwidth of the component carrier under test will be used in
the parameter calculations of the requirement. In case of more than two
component carriers, the minimum gap condition is computed for any pair
of adjacent component carriers following the same approach as the two
component carriers. The in-gap requirement for the corresponding pairs
shall apply if the minimum gap condition is met. For every component
carrier to which the requirements apply, the UE shall meet the
requirement with one active interferer signal (in-gap or out-of-gap)
while all downlink carriers are active and the input power shall be
distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with each
other.

##### 7.6A.2.0.3 In-band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the in-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.2 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation and
uplink carrier(s) assigned to one NR band, the requirement is defined
with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is
being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in clauses
7.6A.2.1 and 7.6A.2.2 for each band while all downlink carriers are
active.

#### 7.6A.2.1 In-band blocking for CA (2DL CA)

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for intra-band
    contiguous CA supporting aggregated BW \> 400MHz and for intra-band
    non-contiguous CA are TBD.

-   Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power
    class 1, 2 and 4.

-   In case of frequency separation larger than 800 MHz and in case the
    device manufacturer does not explicitly declare that the beam peak
    for a reference (frequency band, CBW) or (frequency band
    combination, CA BW class) is applicable for a group of other
    intra-band contiguous combinations and CA BW classes, according to
    Table A.4.3.9-6 in 38.508-2, following aspect of beam peak search
    procedures for CA is FFS: RB allocation, power level, channel
    bandwidth configuration, per CC approach or all CC combined
    approach, etc

-   Some references are in square brackets for inter-band DL CA

-   Test Point Analysis is FFS

##### 7.6A.2.1.1 Test purpose {#a.2.1.1-test-purpose-1 .H6}

Same test purpose as in clause 7.6.2.1.

##### 7.6A.2.1.2 Test applicability {#a.2.1.2-test-applicability-1 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward that
supports FR2 inter-band 2DL CA.

##### 7.6A.2.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#a.2.1.3-minimum-conformance-requirements-1 .H6}

Same minimum conformance requirements as in clause 7.6A.2.0.

##### 7.6A.2.1.4 Test description {#a.2.1.4-test-description-1 .H6}

##### 7.6A.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.2.1.4.1-initial-conditions-1 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR operating bands specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and sub-carrier spacing, are shown in
Table 7.6A.2.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMC) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3.
Configuration of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in
Annex C.2. The details of the OCNG patterns used are specified in Annex
A.5.

Table 7.6A.2.1.4.1-1: Test Configuration Table

FFS

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
Figure A.3.3.1.2 for TE diagram and Figure A.3.4.1.1 for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The DL and UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to
Table 7.6A.2.1.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity *NR*, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38-508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message content are defined in clause 7.6A.2.1.4.3.

7.6A.2.1.4.2 Test Procedure

Test procedure for Inter-band:

1\. Configure SCC according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.

2\. The SS shall configure SCC as per TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 7.4A.1.4.3.

3\. SS activates SCC by sending the activation MAC CE (Refer
TS 38.321\[28\], clauses 5.9, 6.1.3.10). Wait for at least 2 seconds
(Refer TS 38.133\[25\], clause 9.2).

4\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1\_1 for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 7.6A.2.1.4.1-1. The SS sends downlink MAC
padding bits on the DL RMC.

5\. SS sends uplink scheduling information on PCC for each UL HARQ
process via PDCCH DCI format \[0\_1\] for C\_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.6A.2.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to
send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.

6\. Set SS with the downlink signal applied to the θ-polarization of the
measurement antenna.

7\. Set the UE in the SCC Rx beam peak direction found for the primary
component carrier with a 3D EIS scan as performed in Annex K.1.2. Allow
at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 1) for the UE Rx beam selection
to complete.

8\. Set downlink signal level for θ-polarization 3dB below values
described in 7.6.2.5-1 for SCC.

9\. Send Uplink power control commands to the UE (less or equal to 1dB
step size should be used), to ensure that the UE output power is within
\[TBD\] dB of the target power level in Table 7.6A.2.1.4.1-1, for at
least the duration of the throughput measurement.

10\. Apply the blocking signal with the same polarization and coming
from the same direction as the downlink signal. Set the power level of
the blocking signal 3dB below the level stated in the requirement in
7.6.2.5-1.

11\. For SCC, measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient
to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2.

12\. Repeat steps from 3 to 11, for the downlink signal from
φ-polarization.

13\. Repeat steps 3 to 12 switching PCC and SCC test frequencies.

> 14\. Compare the results for both the θ-polarization and
> φ-polarization against the requirement for each component carrier. If
> all results meet the requirements, pass the UE.

NOTE 1: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.1.2

##### 7.6A.2.1.4.3 Message contents {#a.2.1.4.3-message-contents-1 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6 with
TRANSFORM\_PRECODER\_ENABLED condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.

##### 7.6A.2.1.5 Test requirement {#a.2.1.5-test-requirement-1 .H6}

Fore each component carrier, the throughput measurement derived in test
procedure shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annex A with parameters specified
in Table 7.6A.2.1.5-1.

7.6D Blocking characteristics for UL MIMO
-----------------------------------------

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-2 \[3\] clause
7.6D.

No test case details are specified. Given UE's Rx performance would not
be impacted by the Tx configuration on TDD bands, the requirements in
this test case can be well covered in 7.6 and don't need to be tested
again.

7.9 Spurious emissions
----------------------

Editor\'s note: Following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

\- The testability of this test case is pending further analysis on
relaxation of the requirement for band other than n257, n258, n259, n260
and n261.

\- TRP Measurement uncertainty is TBD for above 87 GHz.

\- Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances are FFS for power class
other than PC1, PC3, PC5, PC6.

\- Connection diagram between SS and UE in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A is
FFS.

\- Test procedure is FFS for laptop.

##### 7.9.1 Test purpose {#test-purpose-18 .H6}

Test verifies the UE\'s spurious emissions meet the requirements
described in clause 7.9.3.

Excess spurious emissions increase the interference to other systems.

##### 7.9.2 Test applicability {#test-applicability-18 .H6}

This test case applies to all types of *NR* UE release 15 and forward.

##### 7.9.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#minimum-conformance-requirements-18 .H6}

The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver. The spurious emissions power level is measured
as TRP.

The power of any narrow band CW spurious emission shall not exceed the
maximum level specified in Table 7.9.3-1. The requirement is verified in
beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=TRP grid).

##### 7.9.4 Test description {#test-description-17 .H6}

##### 7.9.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-18 .H6}

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state.

The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions,
test frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based
on NR operating bands specified in Table 5.3.5-1. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each
combination of channel bandwidth and sub-carrier spacing, are shown in
table 7.9.4.1-1. The details of the uplink and downlink reference
measurement channels (RMC) are specified in Annexes A.2 and A.3.
Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH before measurement are specified in
Annex C.2.

1\. Connection between SS and UE is shown in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] Annex A,
\[Figure TBD\] for TE diagram and \[Figure TBD\] for UE diagram.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS
38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.4.3.

3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C, and
uplink signals according to Annex G.

4\. The DL and UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to
Table 7.9.4.1-1.

5\. Propagation conditions are set according to Annex B.0.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC\_CONNECTED with generic procedure
parameters Connectivity NR, Connected without release *On,* Test Mode
*On* and Test Loop Function *On* according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause
4.5. Message content are defined in clause 7.9.4.3.

##### 7.9.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-18 .H6}

1\. Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\. If the re-positioning concept is applied, position the device in DUT
Orientation 1 if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith
angular range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1;
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) if the
maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular range
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for the alignment option selected
in step 1. If the re-positioning concept is not applied, position the
device in DUT Orientation 1.

3\. Set the UE in the Inband Tx beam peak direction found with a 3D EIRP
scan as performed in Annex K.1.1 using the uplink configuration in
section 6.2.1.1. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME (NOTE 3) for
the UE Tx beam selection to complete.

4\. SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

5\. Measure the spurious emissions as per steps outlined below with an
exception to the procedure in Annex K if the re-positioning concept is
applied (NOTE 4). Step (a) is optional and applicable only if SNR (test
requirement level in Table 7.9.5-1 minus offset value minus noise floor
of the test system) ≥ 0 dB is guaranteed. During measurement the
spectrum analyser shall be set to \'Detector\' = RMS.

\(a\) Perform coarse TRP measurements to identify spurious emission
frequencies and corresponding power level according to the procedures in
Annex K, using coarse TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per
Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through 6.5.3.1.4.2-3 . The measurement is
completed in both polarizations *θ* and *φ* over frequency range and
measurement bandwidth according to Table 7.9.5-1. Optionally, a larger
and non-constant measurement bandwidth than that of Table 7.9.5-1 may be
applied. The measurement period shall capture the active time slots. For
each spurious emission frequency with coarse TRP identified to be less
than the offsets listed in Tables 6.5.3.1.4.2-1 through
6.5.3.1.4.2-3from the TRP limit according to Table 7.9.5-1, either
continue with another coarse TRP procedure and corresponding offset
according to step (a) or continue with fine TRP procedures according to
step (b).

> Different coarse TRP grids and corresponding offset values may be used
> for different frequencies. Multiple coarse TRP grids measurements with
> the corresponding offset values can be performed before the fine TRP
> measurement grid is applied. The coarse TRP grids and offset values
> used shall be recorded in the test report.

\(b\) Measure fine TRP measurements according to procedures in Annex K,
using fine TRP measurement grid selection criteria as per Table M.4.5-3
in Annex M, for each of the spurious emission frequency identified in
step (a). Apply a measurement bandwidth according to Table 7.9.5-1.

6\. SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

NOTE 1: The frequency range defined in Table 7.9.5-1 may be split into
ranges. For each range a different test system, e.g. antenna and/or
chamber, may be used. To pass the test case all verdicts of the
frequency ranges must pass.

NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 3: The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME default value is defined in Annex
K.

NOTE 4: If the (in-band) beam peak is within 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 1 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 2. If the
(in-band) beam peak is within 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^: perform first
hemispherical TRP scan (0^o^≤θ≤90^o^) in DUT Orientation 2 and second
hemispherical TRP scan (90^o^\>θ≥0^o^) in DUT Orientation 1. The DUT
with UBF activated needs to be re-positioned during the test.

NOTE 5: Void.

##### 7.9.4.3 Message contents {#message-contents-17 .H6}

Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 \[10\] subclause 4.6.

##### 7.9.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-15 .H6}

The measured spurious emissions derived in step 5, shall not exceed the
maximum level specified in Table 7.9.5-1.
