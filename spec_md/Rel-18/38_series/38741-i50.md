Foreword
========

This Technical Specification\|Report has been produced by the 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

4 Background
============

3GPP RAN\#86 meeting approved the Rel-17 WI that aimed to enable support
of the 5G/NR radio access technology for non-terrestrial satellite
deployments. One of the WI objectives was to define and introduce the
corresponding bands into the 3GPP specifications. The outcome of these
discussions was two NTN bands -- L-band and S-band -- which were added
as bands n255 and n256, respectively. At the same time there exist other
satellite deployments, some of which use mixed L-/S-band pairing,
whereupon the UL part is on the L-band, while the DL part is on the
S-band. To limit the overall workload in Rel-17, it was decided by RAN
WG4 to focus on L- and S-bands with the common understanding that other
potential NTN bands should follow the \"normal\" process of submitting a
new spectrum WI.

3GPP RAN\#98 meeting agreed a new spectrum WI to add support for a new
NTN band with the DL part on the S-band (2500MHz) and the UL part on the
L-band (1600MHz).

5 Regulations
=============

NOTE: The purpose of this section is to collect information from
existing regulatory documents concerning regulatory rules applicable to
this NTN L-/S-band.

5.0 International regulations and WRC provisions
------------------------------------------------

Table 5.0-1 below presents an excerpt from the international radio
regulations with information on which services are allocated to the
frequency range of 1610-1626.5MHz in every ITU region. According to the
WRC provision 5.364 the whole frequency range can be shared between
mobile satellite and radiodetermination services, subject for further
coordination between Administrations. However, provision 5.371 also
clarifies that rardiodetermination services are always secondary to
mobile satellite services in Region 1. In addition to that WRC provision
5.364 clarifies that if either mobile satellite or radiodetermination
service operate in the same frequency range where aeronautical
radionavigation are deployed in accordance with WRC provision 5.366,
then they should apply EIRP density limit of -15dBw/4kHz (unless
otherwise agreed by the affected administrations). Otherwise, the EIRP
density of -3dBw/4kHz can be applied.

For the sake of convenience, the most relevant WRC provisions are also
presented below:

\- **5.364.** The use of the band 1 610-1 626.5 MHz by the
mobile-satellite service (Earth-to-space) and by the
radiodetermination-satellite service (Earth-to-space) is subject to
coordination under No. 9.11A. A mobile earth station operating in either
of the services in this band shall not produce a peak e.i.r.p. density
in excess of -15 dB(W/4 kHz) in the part of the band used by systems
operating in accordance with the provisions of No. 5.366 (to which No.
4.10 applies), unless otherwise agreed by the affected administrations.
In the part of the band where such systems are not operating, the mean
e.i.r.p. density of a mobile earth station shall not exceed --3 dB(W/4
kHz). Stations of the mobile-satellite service shall not claim
protection from stations in the aeronautical radionavigation service,
stations operating in accordance with the provisions of No. 5.366 and
stations in the fixed service operating in accordance with the
provisions of No. 5.359. Administrations responsible for the
coordination of mobile-satellite networks shall make all practicable
efforts to ensure protection of stations operating in accordance with
the provisions of No. 5.366.

\- **5.366.** The band 1 610-1 626.5 MHz is reserved on a worldwide
basis for the use and development of airborne electronic aids to air
navigation and any directly associated ground-based or satellite-borne
facilities. Such satellite use is subject to agreement obtained under
No. 9.21

\- **5.371.** Additional allocation: in Region 1, the band 1 610-1 626.5
MHz (Earth-to-space) is also allocated to the
radiodetermination-satellite service on a secondary basis, subject to
agreement obtained under No. 9.21. (WRC-12)

### 5.1.1 47 CFR § 25.202 

According to paragraph (a)(4)(i), the following frequencies are
available for use by the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service:

\- 1610-1626.5 MHz: User-to-Satellite Link

\- 1613.8-1626.5 MHz: Satellite-to-User Link (secondary)

\- 2483.5-2500 MHz: Satellite-to-User Link

According to paragraph (f) on emission limitations, except for SDARS
terrestrial repeaters and as provided for in paragraph (i), the mean
power of emissions shall be attenuated below the mean output power of
the transmitter in accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraphs
(f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section:

\(1\) In any 4 kHz band, the centre frequency of which is removed from
the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 100
percent of the authorized bandwidth: 25 dB;

\(2\) In any 4 kHz band, the centre frequency of which is removed from
the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent up to and including 250
percent of the authorized bandwidth: 35 dB;

\(3\) In any 4 kHz band, the centre frequency of which is removed from
the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized
bandwidth: An amount equal to 43 dB plus 10 times the logarithm (to the
base 10) of the transmitter power in watts;

\(4\) In any event, when an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth
causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion,
require greater attenuation than specified in paragraphs (f) (1), (2)
and (3) of this section.

### 5.1.2 47 CFR § 25.216 

\(c\) The e.i.r.p. density of emissions from mobile earth stations
placed in service after July 21, 2002 with assigned uplink frequencies
between 1610 MHz and 1660.5 MHz shall not exceed −70 dBW/MHz, averaged
over any 2 millisecond active transmission interval, in the band
1559-1605 MHz. The e.i.r.p. of discrete emissions of less than 700 Hz
bandwidth from such stations shall not exceed −80 dBW, averaged over any
2 millisecond active transmission interval, in the 1559-1605 MHz band.

The frequency offset and relative power level of the adjacent signal
compared to the wanted signal shall take the values given in Table
5.2.1-6. The adjacent signal shall occupy the same bandwidth as the
wanted signal where BW is the wanted signal occupied bandwidth. There
shall be no more than 0.5dB degradation in the receiver signal to noise
ratio under these conditions.

Receiver blocking characteristics are to prevent high power signals
outside the receive frequency band from blocking the reception of
signals inside the receive frequency band. The blocking characteristic
is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive a wanted signal at
its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an unwanted interferer
on frequencies other than those of the spurious response or the adjacent
channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a degradation of
the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit. Receiver
blocking is specified for in-band signals. In-band signals are signals
in the range:

BE~L~-10MHz to BE~U~ +10 MHz, where BE~L~ and BE~U~ are the lower and
upper edges of the operating band respectively.

The receiver performance degradation, in terms of signal to noise ratio,
shall not exceed 1dB when the unwanted signal as specified in Table
5.2.1-7 is present.

##### 6.2.1.2.2.4 Summary of the power back-off values {#summary-of-the-power-back-off-values .H6}

Presented power back-off values can be summarised as follows:

\- NR channels placed at the leftmost edge of the band might need power
back-off, exact value of which depends on the number of the scheduled
RBs and their location. Results are the same for both FCC and ETSI
requirements because the main limiting factor is the out-of-band
emission requirements, which are the same for both regulatory domains.
In other words, even though ETSI has additional in-band emission
requirements for 1610-1618MHz, they do not impact results. Figure
6.2.1.2.2.4-1 illustrates power spectrum of the fully allocated 5MHz
channel right at the lower edge of the band showing that unless power
back-off is applied out of band emission requirements will be violated.

\- As somewhat anticipated, RBs scheduled at the centre of the NR
channel do not require any power back-off; but RBs scheduled at the
leftmost edge of the configured NR channel do require power back-off to
meet out-of-band emission requirements. Similarly, power back-off is
needed when all RBs are scheduled to mitigate emissions coming from the
full-channel transmissions.

\- In case of the 5MHz channel, once the channel is shifted farther from
the left edge of the band where the GNSS services are, the required
power back-off goes down a lot and is caused mostly by the in-band
emission requirements. For instance, if the 5MHz NR channel is shifted
by 1.4MHz from the lower edge, then small RB allocations will not
require any power back-off at all. Some of the channel edge allocations
might need power back-off, but it does not exceed baseline MPR. For both
FCC and ETSI regulations the switching point is around the centre
frequency of 1615.7MHz, after which power back-off values remain limited
to the basic MPR requirements for any configuration case.

\- The 5MHz channel placed at the rightmost edge of the band may need
some A-MPR for the RBs scheduled at the right edge of the channel under
the ETSI regulations because the latter have out-of-band emission
requirements for higher frequencies. Figure 6.2.1.2.2.4-2 shows the
power spectrum plot for the right-most channel, from which one can see
that unless a UE applies power back-off the ETSI out-of-band emission
requirements can be violated. Nevertheless, once the channel is shifted
away from the upper edge by 1.6MHz, no A-MPR is needed at least for
small allocations. And under the FCC regulations no A-MPR is needed even
for the right-most channel because there are no out-of-band emission
requirements for higher frequencies.

\- As for the 10 and 15MHz channels, even if we shift the channel to the
right from the leftmost band edge, some configuration cases would still
require A-MPR irrespective of whether it is ETSI or FCC requirements. As
in the cases for other channels at the band edge, A-MPR is needed mostly
for the case when all RBs are scheduled. The only difference between FCC
and ETSI power back-off values is that FCC will trigger lower A-MPR
because there are no out-of-band emission requirements for upper
frequencies and no in-band emission requirements.

allocated transmission (Fc=1624MHz MHz).

If an operator decides to ensure lower power back-off, then one of the
possible approaches is to rely upon 5MHz channels and to configure them
with offsets from the lower/upper band edges. Then to avoid wasting
1.4/1.6MHz at the edges of the band it is possible to deploy other
technologies, such as LTE CatM and NB-IOT. Figure 6.2.1.2.2.4-3 shows an
exemplary allocation of channels, where an operator may consider one LTE
CatM channel or seven NB-IOT channels at the lower edge of the band. For
the upper edge, either eight NB-IOT channels can be configured, or one
LTE CatM channel can be combined with one NB-IOT channel.

\- Power class PC3

\- WOLA processing

\- I/Q image -28 dBc

\- Carrier leakage -28 dBc

\- CIM3 -60 dBc, CIM5 -70 dBc

\- Only additional emission requirements from FCC (NS\_03N) and ETSI
(NS\_04N, NS\_05N) regulations are simulated.

\- Other gating factors (ACLR, SEM, etc.) are excluded because they are
handled by MPR.

#### 6.2.1.3 Emission requirements and NS values

There are three additional NS values defined for this band as summarised
in Table 6.2.1.3-1 below:

a\) NS\_03N is for the FCC regulatory domain. Since FCC does not
introduce any special in-band emission requirements for sub-ranges, same
requirements will be applicable for the whole range and for all the
channel sizes.

b\) ETSI regulations have different in-band emission masks depending on
the operating sub-range, so two NS flags are needed to differentiate
between them.

c\) NS\_04N applicable range is limited to 1610-1618.25MHz according to
the ETSI requirements. And since the total spectrum block size is
8.25MHz, it can accommodate only 5MHz standard NR channel, i.e. the
applicable NR channel size is 5MHz.

d\) NS\_04N is for the ETSI range 1618.25-1626.5MHz, which can also
accommodate only 5MHz standard NR channel. However, ETSI document also
clarifies that the same in-band emission requirements will apply if the
channel is partially configured in that range. It means that any 10 and
15MHz channel configured in 1610-1626.5MHz range will inevitably fall
into the 1618.25-1626.5MHz range and thus they will follow NS\_04N
requirements.

#### 6.2.1.3a NS values and associated A-MPR

For the 5MHz channel, Figure 6.2.1.3a-1 below presents a graphical
summary of the required power back-off values for different 5MHz
channels:

\- The 5MHz channel right at the lower edge of the band requires power
back-off even for small RB allocations irrespective of the fact whether
it is FCC or ETSI regulations. If the channel is shifted by 1.4MHz, then
at least small RB allocations will not require power back-off exceeding
baseline MPR requirements. Shifting the 5MHz channel beyond the
1615.7MHz centre frequency results in no A-MPR at all.

\- As for the upper edge of the band, the 5MHz channel under the FCC
regulations will not require any additional A-MPR requirements even if
it is right at the edge because there are no out-of-band emission
requirements for the upper frequencies. However, with the ETSI
regulations we will need to provide offset of 1.6MHz, upon which we will
not be exceeding baseline MPR requirements.

\- Because of the same regulations for the lower frequencies, A-MPR
values can be the same for NS\_03N (FCC) and NS\_04N (ETSI lower range)
at centre frequencies 1612.5 \<= fc \< 1615.7MHz. Furthermore, it is
possible to split A-MPR values into two regions -- 1612.5 \<= fc \<
1613.9MHz and 1613.9 \<= fc \< 1615.7MHz -- whereupon the second region
will not require A-MPR for small RB allocations.

\- There is no need for A-MPR for NS\_03N (FCC) at centre frequencies
above 1615.7MHz, but NS\_05N (ETSI upper range) requires A-MPR for
centre frequencies at 1622.4 \< fc \<= 1624MHz.

Figure 6.2.1.3a-1: Summary of required power back-off regions for the
5MHz channel for FCC (top) and ETSI (bottom) regulations.

For the 10MHz channel:

\- For the channel right at the lower edge of the band, A-MPR might be
needed even for small RB allocations at the channel edges because of the
strict out-of-band emission requirements. Shifting the channel farther
away from the lower edge basically improves A-MPR with the switching
point at the centre frequency of around 1620.1MHz (i.e. 1.4MHz offset
from the upper edge), after which at least for the ETSI requirements
emission requirements from the upper frequencies start influencing
allocations at the channel's upper edge. Based on that A-MPR values can
be considered the same for NS\_03N (FCC) and NS\_05N (ETSI) for the
centre frequencies at 1615 \<= fc \< 1620.1MHz.

\- For the channel right at the upper edge of the band, A-MPR is
generally not needed for small allocations under the FCC regulations,
which is reflected in the corresponding A-MPR for NS\_03 for the channel
at 1621.5MHz. However, with NS\_05N (ETSI) A-MPR is still required
because of the out-of-band emission requirements for upper frequencies.

\- As can be seen from Figure 6.2.1.3a-2 below, the only major
difference between the FCC and ETSI A-MPR regions is that the former can
have optimised 10MHz channel placed right at the upper edge of the band.

Figure 6.2.1.3a-2: Summary of required power back-off regions for the
10MHz channel for FCC (top) and ETSI (bottom) regulations.

For the 15MHz channel, more or less same A-MPR is needed for NS\_03N
(FCC) and NS\_05N (ETSI) irrespective of the fact where exactly the
channel is configured and whether it is under the FCC or ETSI
regulations.

#### 6.2.2.3 Out-of-band blocking

For band n254, same out-of-band blocking requirements as for the band
n53 are re-used, whereupon Range 3 exception is adjusted accordingly
accounting for the fact that band n254 upper bound is at 2500MHz.
