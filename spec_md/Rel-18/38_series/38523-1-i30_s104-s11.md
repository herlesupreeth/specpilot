10.4 ATSSS session management
-----------------------------

### 10.4.1 UE-requested MA PDU session management

#### 10.4.1.1 UE-requested MA PDU session establishment / ATSSS / Registered to same PLMNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses simultaneously / Success

##### 10.4.1.1.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp .H6}

##### (1) {#section .H6}

**with** { the UE is registered over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and
SS informs the UE that it supports ATSSS feature in the 5GS network
feature support information element}

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE is configured to request a new MA PDU session }

**then** { UE sends a PDU Session Establishment Request over any of the
two accesses and sets the request type to \"MA PDU request\" in the UL
NAS TRANSPORT message and sets the ATSSS-ST bits in the 5GSM capability
IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message according to the
ATSSS functionality and steering mode that UE supports }

}

##### 10.4.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2, 5.5.3.2.2, 6.4.3.4.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2\]

If the UE is registered to a network which supports ATSSS, the UE may
request to establish an MA PDU session. If the UE requests to establish
an MA PDU session, the UE shall set the request type to \"MA PDU
request\" in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message. If the UE is registered to a
network which does not support ATSSS, the UE shall not request to
establish an MA PDU session.

When the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
the same PLMN and the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session, the
UE may provide an S-NSSAI in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message only if the
S-NSSAI is included in the allowed NSSAIs of both accesses.

NOTE 7: If the UE requested DNN corresponds to an LADN DNN, the AMF does
not forward the MA PDU session information IE to the SMF but sends the
message back to the UE to inform of the unhandled request (see
subclause 5.4.5.2.5).

If the UE is registered to a network which supports ATSSS and the UE has
already an MA PDU session established over one access, the UE may
perform the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure to
establish user-plane resources over the other access for the MA PDU
session as specified in subclause 4.22 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\] and the
S-NSSAI associated with the MA PDU session is included in the allowed
NSSAI of the other access. If the UE establishes user-plane resources
over the other access for the MA PDU session, the UE shall:

a\) set the request type to \"MA PDU request\" in the UL NAS TRANSPORT
message;

b\) set the PDU session ID to the stored PDU session ID corresponding to
the established MA PDU session in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message and in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message; and

c\) set the S-NSSAI in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the stored
S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session ID.

If the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session or if the UE
requests to establish a new PDU session and the UE allows the network to
upgrade the requested PDU session to an MA PDU session:

a\) if the UE supports ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any steering
mode as specified in subclause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE
shall set the ATSSS-ST bits to \"ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any
steering mode supported\" in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode as
specified in subclause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE shall set
the ATSSS-ST bits to \"MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode
supported\" in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message;

c\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode as specified in
subclause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST
bits to \"MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode supported\" in the 5GSM capability
IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message; and

d\) if a performance measurement function in the UE can perform access
performance measurements using the QoS flow of the non-default QoS rule
as specified in subclause 5.32.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE shall
set the APMQF bit to \"Access performance measurements per QoS flow
supported\" in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message.

If the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session and the UE supports
to establish a PDN connection as the user plane resource of an MA PDU
session, the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

...

The UE shall transport:

a\) the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) the PDU session ID of the PDU session being established, being
handed over, being transferred, or been established as an MA PDU
session;

c\) if the request type is set to:

1\) \"initial request\" or \"MA PDU request\" and the UE determined to
establish a new PDU session or an MA PDU session based on either a URSP
rule including one or more S-NSSAIs in the URSP (see subclause 6.2.9) or
UE local configuration, according to subclause 4.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]:

i\) in case of a non-roaming scenario, an S-NSSAI in the allowed NSSAI
which corresponds to one of the S-NSSAI(s) in the matching URSP rule, if
any, or else to the S-NSSAI(s) in the UE local configuration or in the
default URSP rule, if any, according to the conditions given in
subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]; or

ii\) in case of a roaming scenario:

A\) one of the mapped S-NSSAI(s) which corresponds to one of the
S-NSSAI(s) in the matching URSP rule, if any, or else to the S-NSSAI(s)
in the UE local configuration or in the default URSP rule, if any,
according to the conditions given in subclause 4.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]; and

B\) the S-NSSAI in the allowed NSSAI associated with the S-NSSAI in A);
or

2\) \"existing PDU session\", an S-NSSAI, which is an S-NSSAI associated
with the PDU session and (if available in roaming scenarios) a mapped
S-NSSAI, with exception when S-NSSAI is not provided by the network in
subclause 6.1.4.2;

d\) if the request type is set to:

1\) \"initial request\" or \"MA PDU request\" and the UE determined to
establish a new PDU session or an MA PDU session based on either a URSP
rule including one or more DNNs in the URSP (see subclause 6.2.9) or UE
local configuration, according to subclause 4.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\], a DNN which corresponds to one of the DNN(s) in
the matching URSP rule, if any, or else to the DNN(s) in the UE local
configuration or in the default URSP rule, if any, according to the
conditions given in subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]; or

2\) \"existing PDU session\", a DNN which is a DNN associated with the
PDU session;

e\) the request type which is set to:

1\) \"initial request\", if the UE is not registered for emergency
services and the UE requests to establish a new non-emergency PDU
session;

2\) \"existing PDU session\", if the UE is not registered for emergency
services and the UE requests:

i\) handover of an existing non-emergency PDU session between 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access;

ii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for non-emergency bearer
services in the EPS to the 5GS; or

iii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for non-emergency bearer
services in an untrusted non-3GPP access connected to the EPC to the
5GS;

3\) \"initial emergency request\", if the UE requests to establish a new
emergency PDU session;

4\) \"existing emergency PDU session\", if the UE requests:

i\) handover of an existing emergency PDU session between 3GPP access
and non-3GPP access;

ii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for emergency bearer
services in the EPS to the 5GS; or

iii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for emergency bearer
services in an untrusted non-3GPP access connected to the EPC to the
5GS; or

5\) \"MA PDU request\", if:

i\) the UE requests to establish an MA PDU session;

ii\) the UE requests to establish user plane resources over other access
of an MA PDU session established over one access only; or

iii\) the UE performs inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode
according to subclause 4.8.2.3.1 and requests transfer of a PDN
connection which is a user plane resource of an MA PDU session; and

f\) the old PDU session ID which is the PDU session ID of the existing
PDU session, if the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure upon receiving the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND messages with the 5GSM cause IE set to \#39 \"reactivation
requested\";

using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5, and
the UE shall start timer T3580 (see example in figure 6.4.1.2.1).

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.3\]

If the PDU session is an MA PDU session, the SMF shall include the ATSSS
container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message. The SMF
shall set the content of the ATSSS container IE as specified in
3GPP TS 24.193 \[13B\]. If the UE requests to establish user plane
resources over the second access of an MA PDU session which has already
been established over the first access and the parameters associated
with ATSSS previously provided to the UE are not to be updated, the
\"ATSSS container contents\" shall not be included in the ATSSS
container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message.

If the PDU session is a single access PDU session containing the MA PDU
session information IE with the value set to \"MA PDU session network
upgrade is allowed\" and:

a\) if the SMF decides to establish a single access PDU session, the SMF
shall not include the ATSSS container IE in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message; or

b\) if the SMF decides to establish an MA PDU session, the SMF shall
include the ATSSS container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message, which indicates to the UE that the requested single access PDU
session was established as an MA PDU Session.

...

For an MA PDU session already established on a single access, upon
receipt of PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message over the other
access:

a\) the UE shall delete the stored authorized QoS rules;

b\) if the authorized QoS flow descriptions IE is included in the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message, the UE shall delete the stored
authorized QoS flow descriptions; and

c\) if the mapped EPS bearer contexts IE is included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message, the UE shall delete the stored mapped EPS
bearer contexts.

The UE shall store the authorized QoS rules, and the session-AMBR
received in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message for the PDU
session. The UE shall also store the authorized QoS flow descriptions if
it is included in the Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message for the PDU session.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2, 6.4.1.3, TS23.502, clause
4.22.7 and TS 24.193, clause 5.2.1.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2\]

If the UE is registered to a network which supports ATSSS, the UE may
request to establish an MA PDU session. If the UE requests to establish
an MA PDU session, the UE shall set the request type to \"MA PDU
request\" in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message. If the UE is registered to a
network which does not support ATSSS, the UE shall not request to
establish an MA PDU session.

When the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
the same PLMN and the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session, the
UE may provide an S-NSSAI in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message only if the
S-NSSAI is included in the allowed NSSAIs of both accesses.

NOTE 7: If the UE requested DNN corresponds to an LADN DNN, the AMF does
not forward the MA PDU session information IE to the SMF but sends the
message back to the UE to inform of the unhandled request (see
subclause 5.4.5.2.5).

If the UE is registered to a network which supports ATSSS and the UE has
already an MA PDU session established over one access, the UE may
perform the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure to
establish user-plane resources over the other access for the MA PDU
session as specified in subclause 4.22 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\] and the
S-NSSAI associated with the MA PDU session is included in the allowed
NSSAI of the other access. If the UE establishes user-plane resources
over the other access for the MA PDU session, the UE shall:

a\) set the request type to \"MA PDU request\" in the UL NAS TRANSPORT
message;

b\) set the PDU session ID to the stored PDU session ID corresponding to
the established MA PDU session in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message and in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message; and

c\) set the S-NSSAI in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the stored
S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session ID.

If the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session or if the UE
requests to establish a new PDU session and the UE allows the network to
upgrade the requested PDU session to an MA PDU session:

a\) if the UE supports ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any steering
mode as specified in subclause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE
shall set the ATSSS-ST bits to \"ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any
steering mode supported\" in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode as
specified in subclause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE shall set
the ATSSS-ST bits to \"MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode
supported\" in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message;

c\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode as specified in
subclause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST
bits to \"MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode supported\" in the 5GSM capability
IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message; and

d\) if a performance measurement function in the UE can perform access
performance measurements using the QoS flow of the non-default QoS rule
as specified in subclause 5.32.5 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE shall
set the APMQF bit to \"Access performance measurements per QoS flow
supported\" in the 5GSM capability IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message.

If the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session and the UE supports
to establish a PDN connection as the user plane resource of an MA PDU
session, the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

...

The UE shall transport:

a\) the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) the PDU session ID of the PDU session being established, being
handed over, being transferred, or been established as an MA PDU
session;

c\) if the request type is set to:

1\) \"initial request\" or \"MA PDU request\" and the UE determined to
establish a new PDU session or an MA PDU session based on either a URSP
rule including one or more S-NSSAIs in the URSP (see subclause 6.2.9) or
UE local configuration, according to subclause 4.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]:

i\) in case of a non-roaming scenario, an S-NSSAI in the allowed NSSAI
which corresponds to one of the S-NSSAI(s) in the matching URSP rule, if
any, or else to the S-NSSAI(s) in the UE local configuration or in the
default URSP rule, if any, according to the conditions given in
subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]; or

ii\) in case of a roaming scenario:

A\) one of the mapped S-NSSAI(s) which corresponds to one of the
S-NSSAI(s) in the matching URSP rule, if any, or else to the S-NSSAI(s)
in the UE local configuration or in the default URSP rule, if any,
according to the conditions given in subclause 4.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]; and

B\) the S-NSSAI in the allowed NSSAI associated with the S-NSSAI in A);
or

2\) \"existing PDU session\", an S-NSSAI, which is an S-NSSAI associated
with the PDU session and (if available in roaming scenarios) a mapped
S-NSSAI, with exception when S-NSSAI is not provided by the network in
subclause 6.1.4.2;

d\) if the request type is set to:

1\) \"initial request\" or \"MA PDU request\" and the UE determined to
establish a new PDU session or an MA PDU session based on either a URSP
rule including one or more DNNs in the URSP (see subclause 6.2.9) or UE
local configuration, according to subclause 4.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\], a DNN which corresponds to one of the DNN(s) in
the matching URSP rule, if any, or else to the DNN(s) in the UE local
configuration or in the default URSP rule, if any, according to the
conditions given in subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 \[19\]; or

2\) \"existing PDU session\", a DNN which is a DNN associated with the
PDU session;

e\) the request type which is set to:

1\) \"initial request\", if the UE is not registered for emergency
services and the UE requests to establish a new non-emergency PDU
session;

2\) \"existing PDU session\", if the UE is not registered for emergency
services and the UE requests:

i\) handover of an existing non-emergency PDU session between 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access;

ii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for non-emergency bearer
services in the EPS to the 5GS; or

iii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for non-emergency bearer
services in an untrusted non-3GPP access connected to the EPC to the
5GS;

3\) \"initial emergency request\", if the UE requests to establish a new
emergency PDU session;

4\) \"existing emergency PDU session\", if the UE requests:

i\) handover of an existing emergency PDU session between 3GPP access
and non-3GPP access;

ii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for emergency bearer
services in the EPS to the 5GS; or

iii\) transfer of an existing PDN connection for emergency bearer
services in an untrusted non-3GPP access connected to the EPC to the
5GS; or

5\) \"MA PDU request\", if:

i\) the UE requests to establish an MA PDU session;

ii\) the UE requests to establish user plane resources over other access
of an MA PDU session established over one access only; or

iii\) the UE performs inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode
according to subclause 4.8.2.3.1 and requests transfer of a PDN
connection which is a user plane resource of an MA PDU session; and

f\) the old PDU session ID which is the PDU session ID of the existing
PDU session, if the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure upon receiving the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND messages with the 5GSM cause IE set to \#39 \"reactivation
requested\";

using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5, and
the UE shall start timer T3580 (see example in figure 6.4.1.2.1).

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.3\]

If the PDU session is an MA PDU session, the SMF shall include the ATSSS
container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message. The SMF
shall set the content of the ATSSS container IE as specified in
3GPP TS 24.193 \[13B\]. If the UE requests to establish user plane
resources over the second access of an MA PDU session which has already
been established over the first access and the parameters associated
with ATSSS previously provided to the UE are not to be updated, the
\"ATSSS container contents\" shall not be included in the ATSSS
container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message.

If the PDU session is a single access PDU session containing the MA PDU
session information IE with the value set to \"MA PDU session network
upgrade is allowed\" and:

a\) if the SMF decides to establish a single access PDU session, the SMF
shall not include the ATSSS container IE in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message; or

b\) if the SMF decides to establish an MA PDU session, the SMF shall
include the ATSSS container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message, which indicates to the UE that the requested single access PDU
session was established as an MA PDU Session.

...

For an MA PDU session already established on a single access, upon
receipt of PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message over the other
access:

a\) the UE shall delete the stored authorized QoS rules;

b\) if the authorized QoS flow descriptions IE is included in the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message, the UE shall delete the stored
authorized QoS flow descriptions; and

c\) if the mapped EPS bearer contexts IE is included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message, the UE shall delete the stored mapped EPS
bearer contexts.

The UE shall store the authorized QoS rules, and the session-AMBR
received in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message for the PDU
session. The UE shall also store the authorized QoS flow descriptions if
it is included in the Authorized QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message for the PDU session.

...

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.22.7\]

If the UE has established a MA PDU Session but the user-plane resources
over one access of the MA PDU Session have not been established, then:

\- If the UE wants to add user-plane resources over this access, the UE
shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure over
this access, as specified in clause 4.3.2.2. In the UL NAS Transport
message, the UE sets Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" and the same PDU
Session ID of the established MA PDU Session. If only one N9 tunnel is
established for the Home Routed roaming case as described in clause
4.22.2.2, additional N9 tunnel is established during this UE Requested
PDU Session Establishment procedure. For the roaming with home-routed
architecture as defined in TS 23.501 \[2\] figure 4.2.10-3, an N9 tunnel
or an N3 tunnel is established during this PDU Session Establishment
procedure, depending on the access for which the UE is requesting
user-plane resources.

\- The PDU Session Establishment Accept message received by the UE may
contain updated ATSSS rules for the MA PDU session.

\- If the SMF receives the PDU Session Establishment request message
over an access and the SMF already has SM Contexts for the access, the
SMF shall not release existing SM Contexts and shall re-activate user
plane resources over the access while providing the PDU Session
Establishment Accept message to the UE.

If the UE has established a MA PDU Session and the user-plane resources
over one access of the MA PDU Session have been established but are
currently inactive (e.g. because the UE is CM-IDLE over this access),
then:

\- If the UE wants to re-activate the user-plane resources over this
access, then the UE shall initiate the Registration or UE Triggered
Service Request procedure over this access, as specified in clause
4.22.9.2.

\- If the network wants to re-activate the user-plane resources over
3GPP access of the MA PDU Session, or over non-3GPP access of the MA PDU
Session, the network shall initiate the Network Triggered Service
Request procedure, as specified in clause 4.22.9.4.

If the UE has established a MA PDU Session and the user plane resources
are activated over either one access or both accesses, then:

\- If the network wants to de-activate the user-plane resources over
single access, then the network shall initiate the CN-initiated
deactivation of UP connection procedure over this access, as specified
in clause 4.3.7.

In all cases, if the UP security protection associated with this PDU
session indicates that UP security is required, the SMF shall not
establish resources over the 3GPP access unless the 3GPP Access Network
can enforce the required UP security protection, even if resources were
previously established over non-3GPP access.

\[TS 24.193, clause 5.2.1\]

Activating multi-access PDU connectivity service refers to the
establishment of user-plane resources on both 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access:

a\) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
the same PLMN, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over a selected access, either 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access. Over which access to initiate this UE-requested PDU
session establishment procedure is UE implementation specific. When the
UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message including the
ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], the UE shall consider that the MA PDU session has
been established and the user plane resources are successfully
established on the selected access. When the user plane resources are
established on the access other than the selected access (e.g. received
lower layer indication in 3GPP access or established user plane IPsec SA
in untrusted non-3GPP access), the UE shall consider the user plane
resources are established on both;

NOTE: If the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message
including the ATSSS container IE and determines, upon an implementation
specific timer expiry, fails to receive user plane resources established
on the access other than the selected access, the UE re-initiates the
UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure over the access other
than the selected access, in order to establish user plane resources on
the access other than the selected access.

b\) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
different PLMNs, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access sequentially.
Over which access to first initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure is UE implementation specific. When the UE
receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message including the
ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over the selected access, the UE shall consider
that the MA PDU session has been established and the user plane
resources of the MA PDU session on this access are successfully
established. The UE shall then initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure with the same PDU session ID, as specified in
clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over the other access, in order
to establish user plane resources on the other access for the MA PDU
session. If the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message
as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over the other
access, the UE shall consider that the user plane resources of the MA
PDU session have been established on both 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access; or

c\) if the UE is registered to a PLMN over only one access, either 3GPP
access or non-3GPP access, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU
session establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over this access. When the UE receives the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message including the ATSSS container IE as
specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over the access, the
UE shall consider that the MA PDU session has been established and the
user plane resources of the MA PDU session on this access are
successfully established. When the UE at a later point in time registers
over the other access, either in the same PLMN or in a different PLMN,
the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure with the same PDU session ID as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over the other access in order to establish user
plane resources on the other access for the MA PDU session. If the UE
receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message as specified in
clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over the other access, the UE
shall consider that the user plane resources of the MA PDU session have
been established over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

If the UE is in the non-allowed area, the UE shall not initiate a PDU
session establishment procedure for an MA PDU session over the 3GPP
access. It may still initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for
an MA PDU session over the non-3GPP access other than wireline access
network, however the network shall not establish user plane resources
for the 3GPP access if the UE is in the non-allowed area. The handling
of non-allowed area when using wireline access is described in
3GPP TS 23.316 \[4\].

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.2.3\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, if the SMF
accepts the request to modify the PDU session, the SMF shall perform the
network-requested PDU session modification procedure as specified in
subclause 6.3.2.

If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message contains a Port
management information container IE, the SMF shall handle the contents
of the Port management information container IE as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\].

\[TS 24.193, clause 5.2.5\]

When an ATSSS capable UE has transferred a PDN connection from S1 mode
to N1 mode in the network supporting N26 interface and the related URSP
or UE local configuration does not mandate the PDU session shall be
established over a single access:

a\) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
the same PLMN, and the S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session over 3GPP
access is included in the allowed NSSAI of non-3GPP access, the UE may
initiate the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure by sending
the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message including 5GSM capability
IE over 3GPP access as specified in clause 6.4.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]. The UE may set the Request type IE to either:

1\) \"modification request\" and include the MA PDU session information
IE set to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as defined in
clause 9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]; or

2\) \"MA PDU request\"

in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in clause 8.2.10 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message including the ATSSS container IE as specified in
clause 6.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], the UE shall consider that the
requested PDU session was converted by the network to an MA PDU session
and the user plane resources are successfully established on 3GPP
access. When the user plane resources are established on the non-3GPP
access (e.g., received established user plane IPsec SA in untrusted
non-3GPP access), the UE shall consider the user plane resources are
established on both accesses;

NOTE: If the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
including the ATSSS container IE and fails to receive user plane
resources established on the non-3GPP access, upon an implementation
specific timer expiry the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure over the non-3GPP access, in order to establish
user plane resources on the non-3GPP access.

b\) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
different PLMNs, the UE may initiate the UE-requested PDU session
modification procedure by sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message including 5GSM capability IE over 3GPP access as specified in
clause 6.4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]. The UE may set the Request type
IE to either:

1\) \"modification request\" and include the MA PDU session information
IE set to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as defined in
clause 9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]; or

2\) \"MA PDU request\"

in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in clause 8.2.10 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message including the ATSSS container IE as specified in
clause 6.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], the UE shall consider that the
requested PDU session was converted by the network to an MA PDU session
and the user plane resources are successfully established on 3GPP
access. The UE shall then initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure with the same PDU session ID, as specified in
clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over non-3GPP access, in order to
establish user plane resources on the other access for the MA PDU
session; or

c\) if the UE is registered over 3GPP access only, the UE may initiate
the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure by sending the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message including 5GSM capability IE over
3GPP access as specified in clause 6.4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], The
UE may set the Request type IE to either:

1\) \"modification request\" and include the MA PDU session information
IE set to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as defined in
clause 9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]; or

2\) \"MA PDU request\"

in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in clause 8.2.10 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message including the ATSSS container IE as specified in
clause 6.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], the UE shall consider that the
requested PDU session was converted by the network to an MA PDU session
and the user plane resources are successfully established on 3GPP
access. When the UE at a later point in time registers over the non-3GPP
access, either in the same PLMN or in a different PLMN, the UE shall
initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure with the
same PDU session ID as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] over non-3GPP access in order to establish user
plane resources on non-3GPP access for the MA PDU session.

##### 10.4.1.6.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-5 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-5 .H6}

**with** { the UE is in PDU SESSION ACTIVE state and requested to modify
the PDU session from EPS to an MA PDU session with the Request type IE
set to \"MA PDU request\" in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the UE receives PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message with
5GSM cause IE set to \"requested service option not subscribed\" }

**then** { the UE shall stop timer T3581 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION INACTIVE }

}

##### 10.4.1.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-5 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.2.4.1.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.2.4.1\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, if the SMF
does not accepts the request to modify the PDU session, the SMF shall
create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.

The SMF shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REJECT message to indicate the reason for rejecting the PDU session
modification.

The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause
values:

\#26 insufficient resources;

\#29 user authentication or authorization failed;

\#31 request rejected, unspecified;

\#32 service option not supported;

\#33 requested service option not subscribed;

\#35 PTI already in use;

\#37 5GS QoS not accepted;

\#43 Invalid PDU session identity;

\#44 Semantic errors in packet filter(s);

\#45 Syntactical error in packet filter(s);

\#46 out of LADN service area;

\#59 unsupported 5QI value;

\#67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN;

\#69 insufficient resources for specific slice;

\#83 Semantic error in the QoS operation;

\#84 Syntactical error in the QoS operation; or

\#95 -- 111 protocol errors.

...

If the UE initiates UE-requested PDU session modification procedure to
modify the PDU session transferred from EPS to an MA PDU session with
the Request type IE set to \"MA PDU request\" in the UL NAS TRANSPORT
message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.193 \[13B\] and the SMF determines,
based on operator policy and subscription information, that the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message is to be rejected, the SMF shall
include the 5GSM cause value \#33 \"requested service option not
subscribed\" in the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT
message.

...

The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, the UE shall stop timer T3581, release the allocated
PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

##### 10.4.2.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-6 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.1,6.3.3.3. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.1\]

The purpose of the network-requested PDU session release procedure is to
enable the network to release a PDU session or the user-plane resources
on a single access of an MA PDU session.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.3\]

For MA PDU session, upon receipt of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND, the
UE shall behave as follows:

a\) if the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND includes the Access type IE and
the MA PDU session has user-plane resources established on both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access, the UE shall consider the user-plane
resources on the access indicated in the Access type IE as released and
shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message;

b\) if the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND includes the Access type IE and
the PDU session and has user-plane resources established on only the
access indicated in the Access type IE, the UE shall consider the MA PDU
session as released and shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE
message; and

c\) if the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND does not include the Access type
IE, the UE shall consider the MA PDU session as released and shall
create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message and the
PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message, the SMF shall
stop timer T3592 and shall consider the PDU session as released.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.6\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

b\) User-plane resources of the MA PDU session on the access indicated
in the Access type IE not established.

If the PDU session is an MA PDU session and has user-plane resources
established on a single access different from the access indicated in
the Access type IE, the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process
the release command and consider the user-plane resources of the MA PDU
session on the access indicated in the Access type IE as successfully
released.

**when** { UE is configured to request a new MA PDU session }

**then** { UE sends a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the request
type set to \"initial request\" and including ATSSS request PCO
parameter }

}

##### 10.5.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-7 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.193, clause 5.3.1. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.193, clause 5.3.1\]

In order to establish a PDN connection as a user-plane resource of an MA
PDU session to be established, the UE shall initiate the UE requested
PDN connectivity procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\].

In the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or, when applicable, in the ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message, of the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure:

a\) the UE shall set the request type to \"initial request\" as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\];

NOTE 1: According to 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\], a newly generated PDU
session ID is included in the protocol configuration options IE or the
extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with the request type \"initial request\".

b\) the UE shall set the PDN Type IE to \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\", \"IPv4v6\"
or \"Ethernet\"; and

c\) in the protocol configuration options or extended protocol
configuration options IE of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE
shall include the ATSSS request PCO parameter. In the ATSSS request PCO
parameter:

1\) if the UE supports ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any steering
mode (i.e., any steering mode allowed for ATSSS Low-Layer functionality)
as specified in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], the UE shall set
the ATSSS-ST field to \"ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any steering
mode allowed for ATSSS-LL supported\";

NOTE 2: The ATSSS Low-Layer functionality cannot be used together with
the redundant steering mode. When the UE indicates that it is capable of
supporting the ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any steering mode, it
implies that the UE supports the ATSSS Low-Layer functionality with any
steering mode except the redundant steering mode.

2\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode as
specified in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], the UE shall set the
ATSSS-ST field to \"MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode
supported\";

3\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode (i.e., any steering mode
allowed for ATSSS-LL) as specified in clause 5.32.6 of
3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"MPTCP
functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any
steering mode allowed for ATSSS-LL supported\";

4\) if the UE supports MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode as
specified in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], the UE shall set the
ATSSS-ST field to \"MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby steering mode
supported\";

5\) if the UE supports MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode (i.e., any steering mode
allowed for ATSSS Low-Layer functionality) as specified in clause 5.32.6
of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"MPQUIC
functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any
steering mode allowed for ATSSS-LL supported\";

6\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode,
MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality
with only active-standby steering mode as specified in clause 5.32.6 of
3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"MPTCP
functionality with any steering mode, MPQUIC functionality with any
steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only active-standby
steering mode supported\"; or

7\) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode,
MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality
with any steering mode (i.e., any steering mode allowed for ATSSS
Low-Layer functionality) as specified in clause 5.32.6 of
3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"MPTCP
functionality with any steering mode, MPQUIC functionality with any
steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode allowed
for ATSSS-LL supported\".

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
of a default EPS bearer context activation procedure as a response to
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\], the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message containing the extended protocol configuration options IE with
the ATSSS response with the length of two octets PCO parameter:

a\) the UE shall consider that the MA PDU session is established based
on parameters from the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection,
as follows:

1\) the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to
the PDU session type of the MA PDU session as follows:

i\) if the PDN type is \"IPv4\", the PDU session type is set to
\"IPv4\";

ii\) if the PDN type is \"IPv6\", the PDU session type is set to
\"IPv6\";

iii\) if the PDN type is \"IPv4v6\", the PDU session type is set to
\"IPv4v6\"; or

iv\) if the PDN type is \"Ethernet\", the PDU session type is set to
\"Ethernet\";

2\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to
PDU address of the MA PDU session;

3\) the APN of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to the DNN
of the MA PDU session;

4\) the PDU session identity of the MA PDU session shall be set to the
PDU session identity included by the UE in the Protocol configuration
options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message;

5\) the S-NSSAI of the MA PDU session shall be set to the S-NSSAI
included by the network in the Protocol configuration options IE or
Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER REQUEST message, if the PDN connection is a non-emergency PDN
connection;

6\) the SSC mode of the MA PDU session shall be set to \"SSC mode 1\";

7\) state of the PDU session shall be set to PDU SESSION ACTIVE; and

8\) the ESM cause of the default EPS bearer context, if any, shall be
mapped to the 5GSM cause of the MA PDU session as follows:

i\) if the ESM cause is \#50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", the 5GSM
cause of the MA PDU session is set to \#50 \"PDU session type IPv4 only
allowed\"; or

ii\) if the ESM cause is \#51 \"PDN type IPv6 only allowed\", the 5GSM
cause of the MA PDU session is set to \#51 \"PDU session type IPv6 only
allowed\";

and that the PDN connection is established as a user-plane resource of
the MA PDU session;

b\) if the network steering functionalities information is included in
the ATSSS response with the length of two octets PCO parameter, the UE
shall use the network steering functionalities information; and

c\) if the measurement assistance information is included in the ATSSS
response with the length of two octets PCO parameter, the UE shall use
the measurement assistance information.

Upon receipt of:

a\) a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message as a response to the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\]; or

b\) an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message of a default
EPS bearer context activation procedure as a response to the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\]
without the extended protocol configuration options IE containing the
ATSSS response with the length of two octets PCO parameter;

the UE shall consider that the MA PDU session is not established and the
PDN connection is not established as a user-plane resource of the MA PDU
session.

otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 23.501, clause 5.32.2\]

A Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session is managed by using the session
management functionality specified in clause 5.6, with the following
additions and modifications:

\- When the UE wants to request a new MA PDU Session:

\- If the UE is registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request
over any of the two accesses. The UE also provides Request Type as \"MA
PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport message. The AMF informs the SMF
that the UE is registered over both accesses and this triggers the
establishment of user-plane resources on both accesses and two N3/N9
tunnels between PSA and the RAN/AN.

\- If the UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request
over one access. The UE also provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\"
in the UL NAS Transport message. After this PDU Session is established
with one N3/N9 tunnel between the PSA and (R)AN established, the UE
shall send another PDU Session Establishment Request over the other
access. The UE also provides the same PDU Session ID and Request Type as
\"MA PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport message. Two N3/N9 tunnels
and User-plane resources on both accesses are established.

\- If the UE is registered over one access only, then the UE shall send
a PDU Session Establishment Request over this access. The UE also
provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport
message. One N3/N9 tunnel between the PSA and (R)AN and User-plane
resources on this access only are established. After the UE is
registered over the second access, the UE shall establish user-plane
resources on the second access.

\- In the PDU Session Establishment Request that is sent to request a
new MA PDU Session, the UE shall provide also its ATSSS capabilities,
which indicate the steering functionalities and the steering modes
supported in the UE. These functionalities are defined in clause 5.32.6.

\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting:

\- the ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode (as specified in
clause 5.32.6.1);

and the network accepts to activate this functionality, then the network
may provide to UE Measurement Assistance Information (see details in
clause 5.32.5) and shall provide to UE one or more ATSSS rules.

NOTE 1: As specified in Table 5.32.8-1 and in Table 5.8.5.8-1, the
ATSSS-LL functionality cannot be used together with the Redundant
steering mode. When the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the
ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode, it is implied that the UE
can support the ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode except the
Redundant steering mode.

\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting:

\- the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL
functionality with only the Active-Standby steering mode (as specified
in clause 5.32.6.1); or

\- the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1);

and the network accepts to activate these functionalities, then the
network provides MPTCP proxy information to UE, and allocates to UE (a)
one IP address/prefix for the MA PDU session (as defined in
clause 5.8.2.2) and (b) two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called
\"MPTCP link-specific multipath\" addresses. Further details are
provided in clause 5.32.6.2.1. In addition, the network may provide to
UE Measurement Assistance Information and shall provide to UE one or
more ATSSS rules. If the UE supports the ATSSS-LL functionality with
only the Active-Standby steering mode, the network shall provide to UE
an ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP traffic. The ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP
traffic shall use the ATSSS-LL functionality and the Active-Standby
Steering Mode to indicate how the non-MPTCP traffic shall be transferred
across the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access in the uplink direction.

\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting

\- the MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL
functionality with only the Active-Standby steering mode (as specified
in clause 5.32.6.1); or

\- the MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1);

and the network accepts to activate these functionalities, then the
network provides MPQUIC proxy information to UE, and allocates to UE (a)
one IP address/prefix for the MA PDU session (as defined in
clause 5.8.2.2) and (b) two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called
\"MPQUIC link-specific multipath\" addresses. Further details are
provided in clause 5.32.6.2.2. In addition, the network may provide to
UE Measurement Assistance Information and shall provide to UE one or
more ATSSS rules. If the UE supports the ATSSS-LL functionality with
only the Active-Standby steering mode, the network shall provide to UE
an ATSSS rule for non-MPQUIC traffic. The ATSSS rule for non-MPQUIC
traffic shall use the ATSSS-LL functionality and the Active-Standby
Steering Mode to indicate how the non-MPQUIC traffic shall be
transferred across the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access in the uplink
direction.

\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting

\- the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode, and the MPQUIC
functionality with any steering mode, and the ATSSS-LL functionality
with only the Active-Standby steering mode (as specified in
clause 5.32.6.1); or

\- the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode, and the MPQUIC
functionality with any steering mode, and the ATSSS-LL functionality
with any steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1);

and the network accepts to activate these functionalities, then the
network provides MPTCP proxy information and MPQUIC proxy information to
UE and allocates to UE (a) one IP address/prefix for the MA PDU session
(as defined in clause 5.8.2.2), (b) two additional IP
addresses/prefixes, called \"MPTCP link-specific multipath\" addresses,
and (c) two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called \"MPQUIC
link-specific multipath\" addresses. Further details are provided in
clause 5.32.6.2.1 and in clause 5.32.6.2.2. In addition, the network may
provide to UE Measurement Assistance Information and shall provide to UE
one or more ATSSS rules. If the UE supports the ATSSS-LL functionality
with only the Active-Standby steering mode, the network shall provide to
UE an ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP and non-MPQUIC traffic (i.e. the traffic
for which neither the MPTCP nor the MPQUIC functionalities are applied).
The ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP and non-MPQUIC traffic shall use the
ATSSS-LL functionality and the Active-Standby Steering Mode to indicate
how the non-MPTCP and non-MPQUIC traffic shall be transferred across the
3GPP access and the non-3GPP access in the uplink direction.

NOTE 2: The \"MPTCP link-specific multipath\" addresses and the \"MPQUIC
link-specific multipath\" addresses can be the same.

\- If the UE requests an S-NSSAI, this S-NSSAI should be allowed on both
accesses. Otherwise, the MA PDU Session shall not be established.

\- The SMF determines the ATSSS capabilities supported for the MA PDU
Session based on the ATSSS capabilities provided by the UE and per DNN
configuration on SMF, as follows:

a\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only
Active-Standby steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), then:

i\) If the DNN configuration allows MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering
mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL), including RTT
measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is capable of
(1) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode
allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink, and (2) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with
Active-Standby mode in the uplink.

NOTE 3: In this case, it is assumed that ATSSS-LL with \"Smallest
Delay\" steering mode is selected for the downlink only when the UPF can
measure RTT without using the PMF protocol, e.g. by using other means
not defined by 3GPP such as using the RTT measurements of MPTCP.

ii\) If the DNN configuration allows MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any
steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL), but not RTT
measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is capable of
(1) MPTCP in the downlink (2) ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any
Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink, and (3) MPTCP and
ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink.

iii\) If the DNN configuration allows MPTCP with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL with only Active-Standby steering mode, the MA PDU Session is
capable of MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink and
in the downlink.

b\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPQUIC functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only
Active-Standby steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), then:

i\) If the DNN configuration allows MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any
steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL), including
RTT measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is
capable of (1) MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any
Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink, and (2) MPQUIC and
ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink.

NOTE 4: In this case, it is assumed that ATSSS-LL with \"Smallest
Delay\" steering mode is selected for the downlink only when the UPF can
measure RTT without using the PMF protocol, e.g. by using other means
not defined by 3GPP such as using the RTT measurements of MPQUIC.

ii\) If the DNN configuration allows MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any
steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL), but not RTT
measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is capable of
(1) MPQUIC in the downlink (2) ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any
Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink, and (3) MPQUIC and
ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink.

iii\) If the DNN configuration allows MPQUIC with any steering mode and
ATSSS-LL with only Active-Standby steering mode, the MA PDU Session is
capable of MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink
and in the downlink.

c\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPQUIC functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering
mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), and the DNN configuration
allows MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any Steering
Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL), the MA PDU Session is capable of MPQUIC and
ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for
ATSSS-LL) in the uplink and in the downlink.

d\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1)
and the DNN configuration allows ATSSS-LL with any steering mode allowed
for ATSSS-LL, the MA PDU Session is capable of ATSSS-LL with any
steering mode allowed for ATSSS-LL in the uplink and in the downlink.

e\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering
mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), and the DNN configuration
allows MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode
allowed for ATSSS-LL), the MA PDU Session is capable of MPTCP and
ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for
ATSSS-LL) in the uplink and in the downlink.

f\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode, and the MPQUIC functionality with any steering
mode, and the ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode\" (as
specified in clause 5.32.6.1), and the DNN configuration allows MPTCP,
MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode
allowed for ATSSS-LL), the MA PDU Session is capable of MPTCP, MPQUIC
and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for
ATSSS-LL) in the uplink and in the downlink.

g\) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode, and the MPQUIC functionality with any steering
mode, and the ATSSS-LL functionality with only the Active-Standby
steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), then:

i\) If the DNN configuration allows MPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any
steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL), including
RTT measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is
capable of (1) MPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode (i.e.
any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink, and (2) MPTCP,
MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink.

NOTE 5: In this case, it is assumed that ATSSS-LL with \"Smallest
Delay\" steering mode is selected for the downlink only when the UPF can
measure RTT without using the PMF protocol, e.g. by using other means
not defined by 3GPP such as using the RTT measurements of MPTCP or
MPQUIC.

ii\) If the DNN configuration allows MPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with any
steering mode (i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL), but not RTT
measurement without using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is capable of
(1) MPTCP and MPQUIC in the downlink (2) ATSSS-LL with any steering mode
(i.e. any Steering Mode allowed for ATSSS-LL) in the downlink, and (3)
MPTCP, MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby mode in the uplink.

iii\) If the DNN configuration allows MPTCP and MPQUIC with any steering
mode and ATSSS-LL with only Active-Standby steering mode, the MA PDU
Session is capable of MPTCP and MPQUIC and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby
mode in the uplink and in the downlink.

The SMF provides the ATSSS capabilities of the MA PDU Session to the PCF
during PDU Session Establishment.

\- The PCC rules provided by PCF include MA PDU Session Control
information (see TS 23.503 \[45\]). They are used by SMF to derive ATSSS
rules for the UE and N4 rules for the UPF. When dynamic PCC is not used
for the MA PDU Session, the SMF shall provide ATSSS rules and N4 rules
based on local configuration (e.g. based on DNN or S-NSSAI).

\- The UE receives ATSSS rules from SMF, which indicate how the uplink
traffic should be routed across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
Similarly, the UPF receives N4 rules from SMF, which indicate how the
downlink traffic should be routed across 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access.

\- When the SMF receives a PDU Session Establishment Request and a \"MA
PDU Request\" indication and determines that UP security protection (see
clause 5.10.3) is required for the PDU Session, the SMF shall only
confirm the establishment of the MA PDU session if the 3GPP access
network can enforce the required UP security protection. The SMF needs
not confirm whether the non-3GPP access can enforce the required UP
security protection.

\- The UE indicates during MA PDU Session Establishment to the AMF
whether it supports non-3GPP access path switching, i.e. whether the UE
can transfer the non-3GPP access path of the MA PDU Session from a
source non-3GPP access (N3IWF/TNGF) to a target non-3GPP access (a
different N3IWF/TNGF). If the UE has indicated support for non-3GPP
access path switching and the AMF supports non-3GPP access path
switching, the AMF selects an SMF that supports non-3GPP access path
switching, if such an SMF is available. If the AMF supports to maintain
two N2 connections for non-3GPP access during the Registration procedure
and the selected SMF supports non-3GPP path switching, the AMF indicates
whether the UE supports non-3GPP path switching to the SMF. The SMF
indicates support for non-3GPP path switching to the UE in the PDU
Session Establishment Accept message.

NOTE 6: If the AMF selects an SMF not supporting non-3GPP access path
switching, the non-3GPP access path switching can still be performed
with the AMF triggering release of the old user plane resources before
new user plane resources are established.

\- After the MA PDU Session establishment:

\- At any given time, the MA PDU session may have user-plane resources
on both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, or on one access only, or may have
no user-plane resources on any access.

\- The AMF, SMF, PCF and UPF maintain their MA PDU Session contexts,
even when the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on
the other access).

\- When the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on
the other access), the AMF informs the SMF to release the resource of
this access type in the UPF for the MA PDU Session. Subsequently, the
SMF notifies the UPF that the access type has become unavailable and the
N3/N9 tunnel for the access type are released.

\- If the UE wants to add user-plane resources on one access of the MA
PDU Session, e.g. based on access network performance measurement and/or
ATSSS rules, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request
over this access containing PDU Session ID of the MA PDU Session. The UE
also provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" and the same PDU
Session ID in the UL NAS Transport message. If there is no N3/N9 tunnel
for this access, the N3/N9 tunnel for this access is established.

\- If the UE wants to re-activate user-plane resources on one access of
the MA PDU Session, e.g. based on access network performance measurement
and/or ATSSS rules, then the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service
Request procedure over this access.

\- If the network wants to re-activate the user-plane resources over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access of the MA PDU Session, the network shall
initiate the Network Triggered Service Request procedure, as specified
in clause 4.22.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

\- If the UE wants to move the non-3GPP user-plane resources of the MA
PDU Session from a source non-3GPP access (e.g. source N3IWF or TNGF) to
a target non-3GPP access (e.g. target N3IWF or TNGF), the UE initiates a
Mobility Registration Update via the target non-3GPP access as described
in TS 23.502 \[3\], clause 4.22.9.5. This procedure may also be used to
move the non-3GPP user-plane resources of single access PDU Session(s).

NOTE 7: The UE can request activation of single access PDU Session(s)
over the target non-3GPP access while performing Mobility Registration
Update procedure according to the existing procedure.

\- The SMF may add, remove or update one or more individual ATSSS rules
of the UE by sending new or updated ATSSS rules with the corresponding
Rule IDs to the UE.

A MA PDU Session may be established either:

a\) when it is explicitly requested by an ATSSS-capable UE; or

b\) when an ATSSS-capable UE requests a single-access PDU Session but
the network decides to establish a MA PDU Session instead. This is an
optional scenario specified in clause 4.22.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\], which
may occur when the UE requests a single-access PDU Session but no policy
(e.g. no URSP rule) and no local restrictions in the UE mandate a single
access for the PDU Session.

A MA PDU Session may be established during a PDU Session modification
procedure when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, as specified in
clause 4.22.6.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AMF indicates as part of the Registration procedure whether ATSSS is
supported or not. When ATSSS is not supported, the UE shall not

\- request establishment of a MA PDU Session (as described in
clause 4.22.2 of TS 23.502 \[3\]); or

\- request addition of User Plane resources for an existing MA PDU
Session (as described in clause 4.22.7 of TS 23.502 \[3\]); or

\- request establishment of a PDU Session with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade
Allowed\" indication (as described in clause 4.22.3 of TS 23.502 \[3\]);
or

\- request PDU Session Modification with Request Type of \"MA PDU
request\" or with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication after
moving from EPC to 5GC (as described in clause 4.22.6.3 of
TS 23.502 \[3\]).

The AMF indicates as part of the Registration procedure whether it
supports non-3GPP access path switching. When the AMF does not indicate
support of non-3GPP access path switching, the UE shall not perform the
Mobility Registration Update procedure for non-3GPP access path
switching, i.e. to switch traffic from a source non-3GPP access to a
target non-3GPP access. The SMF indicates as part of the PDU Session
Establishment procedure whether it supports non-3GPP access path
switching. If the UE has one or more PDU sessions and at least one
serving SMF for the PDU Sessions supports non-3GPP access path
switching, the UE may include (\"Non-3GPP path switching while using old
AN resources\") indication when the UE performs the Mobility
Registration Update procedure for non-3GPP access path switching. If the
UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, the
UE shall use the capability received over non-3GPP access to determine
whether to perform the Mobility Registration Update procedure for
non-3GPP path switching and whether to include (\"Non-3GPP access path
switching while using old AN resources\") indication.

NOTE 8: If the AMF receives (\"Non-3GPP path switching while using old
AN resources\") indication from Mobility Registration Update procedure,
and the serving SMF(s) for PDU Session(s) is not supporting non-3GPP
access path switching, the non-3GPP access path switching can still be
performed with the AMF triggering for each PDU Session the release of
the old user plane resources before new user plane resources are
established.

An ATSSS-capable UE may decide to request a MA PDU Session based on the
provisioned URSP rules. In particular, the UE should request a MA PDU
Session when the UE applies a URSP rule, which triggers the UE to
establish a new PDU Session and the Access Type Preference component of
the URSP rule indicates \"Multi-Access\" (see TS 23.503 \[45\]).

\[TS 24.193, clause 5.3.2\]

In order to establish a PDN connection as a user-plane resource of an
already established MA PDU session, the UE shall initiate the UE
requested PDN connectivity procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\].

In the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or, when applicable, in the ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message, of the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure:

a\) the UE shall set the request type to \"handover\" as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\];

NOTE 1: According to 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\], the PDU session ID of the
already established MA PDU session is included in the protocol
configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration options
IE of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the request type
\"handover\".

b\) the UE shall set the PDN Type IE to \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\", \"IPv4v6\",
\"Ethernet\" or \"non-IP\"; and

NOTE 2: If the UE does not support Ethernet PDN type or the Ethernet PDN
type is not supported in EPC, the UE sets \"non-IP\" PDN type when the
established MA PDU session is Ethernet PDU session type.

c\) in the protocol configuration options or extended protocol
configuration options IE, the UE shall include the ATSSS request PCO
parameter.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
of a default EPS bearer context activation procedure as a response to
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\], the UE shall consider that the PDN connection is
established as a user-plane resource of the MA PDU session.

Upon receipt of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\], the UE shall consider that the PDN connection is
not established as a user-plane resource of the MA PDU session.

Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.193, clause 5.3.4\]

In order to release an MA PDU session which has a PDN connection
established as a user-plane resource:

a\) to release the PDN connection established as a user-plane resource
of the MA PDU session:

1\) the network shall:

i\) initiate the network initiated detach procedure as specified in
clause 5.5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the DETACH REQUEST
message to the UE if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not
supported by the UE and the MME and the PDN connection is the last PDN
connection; or

ii\) initiate the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure as specified
in clause 6.4.4 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is supported by the UE and the MME or the PDN connection is
not the last PDN connection; or

2\) the UE shall:

i\) initiate the UE initiated detach procedure as specified in
clause 5.5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the DETACH REQUEST
message to the network if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not
supported by the UE and the MME and the PDN connection is the last PDN
connection; or

ii\) initiate the UE requested PDN disconnect procedure as specified in
clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the PDN DISCONNECT
REQUEST message to the network if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection
is supported by the UE and the MME or the PDN connection is not the last
PDN connection; and

b\) to release the user-plane resources, if any, established on non-3GPP
access of the MA PDU session:

1\) the network shall initiate the network-requested PDU session release
procedure as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] by
sending the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message with the Access type IE
indicating \"Non-3GPP access\" or without including the Access type IE
to the UE; or

2\) the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session release procedure
as specified in clause 6.4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] by sending the
PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message to the network.

specified in: TS 24.193, clause 5.3.4. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.193, clause 5.3.4\]

In order to release an MA PDU session which has a PDN connection
established as a user-plane resource:

a\) to release the PDN connection established as a user-plane resource
of the MA PDU session:

1\) the network shall:

i\) initiate the network initiated detach procedure as specified in
clause 5.5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the DETACH REQUEST
message to the UE if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not
supported by the UE and the MME and the PDN connection is the last PDN
connection; or

ii\) initiate the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure as specified
in clause 6.4.4 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is supported by the UE and the MME or the PDN connection is
not the last PDN connection; or

2\) the UE shall:

i\) initiate the UE initiated detach procedure as specified in
clause 5.5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the DETACH REQUEST
message to the network if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not
supported by the UE and the MME and the PDN connection is the last PDN
connection; or

ii\) initiate the UE requested PDN disconnect procedure as specified in
clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[10\] by sending the PDN DISCONNECT
REQUEST message to the network if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection
is supported by the UE and the MME or the PDN connection is not the last
PDN connection; and

b\) to release the user-plane resources, if any, established on non-3GPP
access of the MA PDU session:

1\) the network shall initiate the network-requested PDU session release
procedure as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] by
sending the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message with the Access type IE
indicating \"Non-3GPP access\" or without including the Access type IE
to the UE; or

2\) the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session release procedure
as specified in clause 6.4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] by sending the
PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message to the network.

11.1 5GS / EPS Fallback
-----------------------

### 11.1.1 MO MMTEL voice call setup from NR RRC\_IDLE / EPS Fallback with redirection / Single registration mode with N26 interface / Success

##### 11.1.1.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-11 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-16 .H6}

**with** { UE supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode and operating in
single-registration mode and the Network having indicated \"interworking
without N26 interface not supported\" and the UE in NR RRC\_IDLE state }

**ensure that** {

**when** { User initiates an MMTEL call and the UE completes Access
control and checking in 5GMM-IDLE mode }

**then** { UE requests the establishment of an MMTEL call by
transmitting an RRCSetupRequest message with establishmentCause set to
\'mo-VoiceCall\' and a SERVICE REQUEST message with Service type set to
\'data\' }

}

##### (2) {#section-17 .H6}

**with** { UE being in NR RRC\_CONNECTED state after having requested an
MMTEL call establishment and the MO IMS voice session establishment has
been initiated }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE receives an RRCRelease message which includes
redirectedCarrierInfo indicating redirection to E-UTRA }

**then** {UE selects the E-UTRA cell, performs a TAU procedure, and,
successfully completes the MMTEL call setup in EPS }

}

##### 11.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-11 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.5.4.1, 5.6.1.2 and TS 38.331: clauses
5.3.3.2, 5.3.3.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.2\]

For cases d) and e) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the Uplink data status IE
shall be included in the SERVICE REQUEST message to indicate the PDU
session(s) the UE has pending user data to be sent. If the UE is not a
UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN:

a\) if there exists an emergency PDU session which is indicated in the
Uplink data status IE the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message
shall be set to \"emergency services\"; or

b\) otherwise, the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message shall
be set to \"data\".

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.3.2\]

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers request establishment
of an RRC connection while the UE is in RRC\_IDLE and it has acquired
essential system information as described in 5.2.2.1.

The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system
information as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this
procedure.

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon requesting establishment of an RRC connection:

2\> perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14
using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper
layers;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

1\> set the *ue-Identity* as follows:

2\> if upper layers provide a 5G-S-TMSI:

3\> set the ue-Identity to ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part1;

2\> else:

3\> draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..2^39^-1 and set the
*ue-Identity* to this value;

NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the *5G-S-TMSI* if the UE is registered in
the TA of the current cell.

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

##### 11.1.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-12 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS23.502, clauses 4.11.2.2, 4.13.6.1; TS 24.501, clauses
4.5.4.1, 4.8.2.3; TS 38.331, clause5.3.11. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.11.2.2\]

The following procedure is used by UEs in single-registration or dual
registration mode on mobility from 5GS to EPS.

In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID
according to clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.11.2.2-1: Mobility procedure from 5GS to EPS without N26
interface

The UE operating in single-registration mode can start the procedure
from Step 1 or Step 5. The UE operating in dual-registration mode starts
the procedure from Step 5.

NOTE 1: The network has indicated the \"Interworking without N26\" to
the UE. To support IP address preservation, the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 5. If the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 1, the IP
address preservation is not provided.

0\. UE is registered in 5GS and established PDU sessions. The FQDN for
the S5/S8 interface of the PGW-C+SMF is also stored in the UDM by the
PGW-C+SMF during PDU Session setup in addition to what is specified in
clause 4.3.2.2.1 and clause 4.3.2.2.2.

NOTE 2: At 5GS to EPS mobility, the MME use the FQDN for the S5/S8
interface of the PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF, and when UE moves back
from EPS to 5GS, the AMF uses FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the
PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF.

1\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

2\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\] with the following modifications:

The UE shall provide a EPS-GUTI that is mapped from the 5G-GUTI
following the mapping rules specified in TS 23.501 \[2\]. The UE
indicates that it is moving from 5GC.

3\. Step 3 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

4\. If the MME determined that the old node is an AMF based on UE\'s
GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the MME is configured to support 5GS-EPS
interworking without N26 procedure, the MME sends a TAU Reject to the
UE.

5\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\] with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

6\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

7\. Steps 4-7 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

8\. Step 8 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

9\. Step 11 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the following modifications:

The subscription profile the MME receives from HSS+UDM includes per
DNN/APN at most one PGW-C+SMF FQDN as described in in clause 5.17.2.1 in
TS 23.501 \[2\].

10\. Steps 12-24 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications as described in
clause 4.11.2.4.1.

11\. Step 25 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

12\. Step 26 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

13\. If the UE has remaining PDU Sessions in 5GS which it wants to
transfer to EPS and maintain the same IP address/prefix, the UE performs
the UE requested PDN Connectivity Procedure as specified in
TS 23.401 \[13\] clause 5.10.2 and sets the Request Type to \"handover\"
in Step 1 of the procedure with modification captured in clause
4.11.2.4.2. UE provides an APN and the PDU Session ID corresponding to
the PDU Session it wants to transfer to EPS. The UE provides the PDU
Session ID in PCO as described in clause 4.11.1.1.

UEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDU Session
immediately after completing the E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. UEs
in dual-registration mode may perform this step any time after the
completing of E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. Also, UEs in
dual-registration mode may perform this step only for a subset of PDU
Sessions.

The MME determines the PGW-C+SMF address for the Create Session Request
based on the APN received from the UE and the subscription profile
received from the HSS+UDM in Step 9 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the MME
for the new PGW-C+SMF ID in the updated subscription profile.

The PGW-C+SMF uses the PDU Session ID to correlate the transferred PDN
connection with the PDU Session in 5GC.

As a result of the procedure the PGW-U+UPF starts routing DL data
packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers
established for this PDN connection.

14\. The PGW-C+SMF initiates release of the PDU Session(s) in 5GS
transferred to EPS as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 with the following
clarification:

In step 2, the PGW-C+SMF shall not release IP address/prefix(es)
allocated for the PDU Session.

If UP connection of the PDU Session is not active, step 3b is not
executed, thus the steps triggered by step 3b are not executed;

If UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF invokes the
Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation without
including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command).

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.13.6.1\]

Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.

When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing
PDU Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF
has sent an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 in
TS 23.501 \[2\] and the UE has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not
supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends an indication towards the UE
during the Registration procedure that interworking without N26 is
supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 in TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice

1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.

2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for
voice reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).

3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and
decides to trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities,
indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" (received as part of initial context setup as defined in
TS 38.413 \[10\]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to trigger
fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.

NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including E-UTRAN as target.

NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for
voice is not possible\", then AN Release via inter-system redirection to
EPS is not performed in step 5.

4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Response message towards the PGW-C+SMF (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via V-SMF, in
case of roaming scenario) via AMF with an indication that mobility due
to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The PGW-C+SMF maintains the PCC
rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s).

5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), or AN
Release via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause
4.11.1.3.2), taking into account UE capabilities. The PGW-C+SMF reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause
4.11.1.2.1, or clause 4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS,
either 6a or 6b is executed

6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.2.1, and in
the case of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.1.3.2. In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure; or

6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26
interface, see clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag
\"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as
described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[13\] and has received the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported, then the UE
initiates Attach with PDN connectivity request with request type
\"handover\".

In inter-system redirection, the UE uses the emergency indication in the
RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 \[16\] and E-UTRAN
provides the emergency indication to MME during Tracking Area Update or
Attach procedure. For the handover procedure see clause 4.11.1.2.1,
step 1.

7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the
5GS to EPS handover procedure (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), the SMF/PGW
re-initiates the setup of the dedicated bearer for IMS voice, mapping
the 5G QoS to EPC QoS parameters. The PGW-C+SMF behaves as specified in
clause 4.9.1.3.1. The PGW-C+SMF reports about Successful Resource
Allocation and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.

8\. The IMS voice session establishment is continued.

At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is
configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.3\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode when:（
PDU SEESION ACTIVE）

a\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type and at least one PDU session is
active; or

b\) the UE does not support non-IP PDN type and at least one PDU session
of IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type is active,

the UE shall proceed as follows:

a\) if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\"
to transfer a PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE has
received an \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" indication
from the network, the UE shall:

1\) enter substates EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

2\) map the PDU session(s) which the UE intends to transfer to EPS to
the default EPS bearer context of the corresponding PDN connection(s) as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.2; and

3\) initiate an EPS attach procedure and include a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\" in the ATTACH
REQUEST message to activate a default EPS bearer context for one of the
active PDU sessions which the UE intends to transfer to EPS.

After successful completion of the EPS attach procedure, the UE shall
reset the registration attempt counter and the attach attempt counter
(see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]) and attempt to activate each of the other
default EPS bearer contexts, if any, by initiating a stand-alone PDN
connectivity procedure with request type set to \"handover\" in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message; and

b\) otherwise, enter substates EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and initiate a tracking area update
procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode
when:（NO PDU SESSION）

a\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type and no PDU session is active; or

b\) the UE does not support non-IP PDN type and no PDU session of IPv4,
IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type is active,

the UE shall enter substates EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE, and initiate an attach procedure.

At inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE
shall:

a\) enter substate 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and substate
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

b\) map the default EPS bearer context(s) of the PDN connection(s) which
the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, to the corresponding PDU
session(s) as specified in subclause 6.1.4.2; and

c\) initiate the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update indicating \"mobility registration updating\" in the
5GS registration type IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see
subclause 5.5.1.3).

After having successfully registered in N1 mode the UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter and the attach attempt counter (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]) and:

a\) if the UE supports the PDU session establishment procedure with
request type set to \"existing PDU session\" to transfer a PDN
connection from S1 mode to N1 mode and the UE has received an
\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" indication from the
network, attempt to transfer the PDN connection(s) which the UE intends
to transfer to 5GS, if any, from S1 mode to N1 mode by initiating the
PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to \"existing
PDU session\"; and

b\) otherwise, establish PDU session(s) corresponding to the PDN
connection(s) which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, by
initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set
to \"initial request\".

See subclause 5.1.4.3 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.11\]

UE shall:

1\> reset MAC;

1\> if T302 is running:

2\> stop timer T302;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> stop all timers that are running except T320 and T325;

1\> discard the UE Inactive AS context;

1\> set the variable *pendingRnaUpdate* to *false*, if that is set to

1\> discard the K~gNB~, the K~RRCenc~ key, the K~RRCint~, the K~UPint~
key and the K~UPenc~ key, if any;

1\> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity,
the MAC configuration and the associated PDCP entity and SDAP for all
established RBs;

1\> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together
with the release cause;

1\> enter RRC\_IDLE and perform cell selection as specified in TS 38.304
\[20\], except if going to RRC\_IDLE was triggered by selecting an
inter-RAT cell while T311 was running;

1\> if going to RRC\_IDLE was triggered by reception of the *RRCRelease*
message including a *waitTime*:

2\> start timer T302 with the value set to the *waitTime*;

2\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\'.

##### 11.1.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-13 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 23.502, clauses 4.13.6.1, TS 24.501, clauses
4.8.2.2, 5.5.1.2.2, 5.5.1.2.4, 5.1.4.2 and 6.1.4.1, TS 38.331, clause
5.4.3.3 and 5.4.3.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements.

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.13.6.1\]

Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.

When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing
PDU Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF
has sent an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 in
TS 23.501 \[2\] and the UE has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not
supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends an indication towards the UE
during the Registration procedure that interworking without N26 is
supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 in TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice

1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.

2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for
voice reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).

3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and
decides to trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities,
indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" (received as part of initial context setup as defined in
TS 38.413 \[10\]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to trigger
fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.

NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including E-UTRAN as target.

NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for
voice is not possible\", then AN Release via inter-system redirection to
EPS is not performed in step 5.

4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Response message towards the PGW-C+SMF (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via V-SMF, in
case of roaming scenario) via AMF with an indication that mobility due
to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The PGW-C+SMF maintains the PCC
rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s).

5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), or AN
Release via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause
4.11.1.3.2), taking into account UE capabilities. The PGW-C+SMF reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause
4.11.1.2.1, or clause 4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS,
either 6a or 6b is executed

6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.2.1, and in
the case of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.1.3.2. In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure; or

6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26
interface, see clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag
\"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as
described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[13\] and has received the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported, then the UE
initiates Attach with PDN connectivity request with request type
\"handover\".

In inter-system redirection, the UE uses the emergency indication in the
RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 \[16\] and E-UTRAN
provides the emergency indication to MME during Tracking Area Update or
Attach procedure. For the handover procedure see clause 4.11.1.2.1,
step 1.

7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the
5GS to EPS handover procedure (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), the SMF/PGW
re-initiates the setup of the dedicated bearer for IMS voice, mapping
the 5G QoS to EPC QoS parameters. The PGW-C+SMF behaves as specified in
clause 4.9.1.3.1. The PGW-C+SMF reports about Successful Resource
Allocation and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.

8\. The IMS voice session establishment is continued.

At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is
configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.2\]

See subclause 5.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.1 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

If the UE supports S1 mode, the UE shall:

\- set the S1 mode bit to \"S1 mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

\- include the S1 UE network capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message; and

\- if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\" to
transfer a PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode, set the HO attach bit to
\"attach request message containing PDN connectivity request with
request type set to handover to transfer PDU session from N1 mode to S1
mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the UE included S1 mode supported indication in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message, the AMF supporting interworking with EPS shall set the
IWK N26 bit to either:

a\) \"interworking without N26 interface not supported\" if the AMF
supports N26 interface ; or

b\) \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" if the AMF does not
support N26 interface

in the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message.

The UE supporting S1 mode shall operate in the mode for interworking
with EPS as follows:

a\) if the IWK N26 bit in the 5GS network feature support IE is set to
\"interworking without N26 interface not supported\", the UE shall
operate in single-registration mode;

b\) if the IWK N26 bit in the 5GS network feature support IE is set to
\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE supports
dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or

NOTE 3: The registration mode used by the UE is implementation
dependent.

c\) if the IWK N26 bit in the 5GS network feature support IE is set to
\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE only
supports single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in
single-registration mode.

The UE shall treat the received interworking without N26 interface
indicator for interworking with EPS as valid in the entire PLMN and its
equivalent PLMN(s).

The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such
as IMS voice over PS session, emergency services or emergency services
fallback, in the 5GS network feature support information element. In a
UE with IMS voice over PS session capability, the IMS voice over PS
session indicator, the Emergency services support indicator, and the
Emergency services fallback indicator shall be provided to the upper
layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator
into account when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or
calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take the
IMS voice over PS session indicator, the Emergency services support
indicator, and the Emergency services fallback indicator into account
for the access domain selection.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.4.2\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode when there is at least
one active PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.1, the UE shall enter substates
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and
initiate a tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.1.4.1\]

Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall create
the default EPS bearer context and the dedicated EPS bearer context(s)
based on the parameters of the mapped EPS bearer contexts or the
associations between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session,
if available. The EPS bearer identity assigned for the QoS flow of the
default QoS rule becomes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer
in the corresponding PDN connection. If there is no EPS bearer identity
assigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule, the UE shall release
locally the PDU session. If there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to
the QoS flow(s) which is not associated with the default QoS rule, the
UE shall locally delete the QoS rules and the QoS flow level QoS
parameters associated with the QoS flow(s). The UE uses the parameters
from each PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported to
create corresponding default EPS bearer context and optionally dedicated
EPS bearer context(s) as follows:

a\) the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
type of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is
\"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

2\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4\";

3\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv6\"; and

4\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4v6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4v6\";

b\) the PDU address of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
address of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to the PDU
address of the PDU session, if the PDU session type is \"IPv4\",
\"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\"; and

2\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to zero, if
the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

c\) the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default
EPS bearer context;

d\) the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR received in the parameters of the
default EPS bearer context of the mapped EPS bearer contexts shall be
mapped to the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR of the default EPS bearer
context;

e\) for each PDU session in state PDU SESSION ACTIVE, PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION PENDING or PDU SESSION INACTIVE PENDING the UE shall set
the state of the mapped EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE;
and

f\) for any other PDU session the UE shall set the state of the mapped
EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.

Additionally, for each mapped EPS bearer context or the association
between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session:

a\) the EPS bearer identity shall be set to the EPS bearer identity
received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS bearer identity
associated with the QoS flow;

b\) the EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped EPS QoS parameters
of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS
QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow;

c\) the extended EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped extended
EPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer
context, or the extended EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS
flow; and

d\) the traffic flow template shall be set to the mapped traffic flow
template of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or
the stored traffic flow template associated with the QoS flow, if
available.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall
associate the PDU session identity, the S-NSSAI, and the session-AMBR
with the default EPS bearer context, and for each EPS bearer context
mapped from one or more QoS flows, associate the QoS rule(s) for the QoS
flow(s) and the QoS flow description(s) for the QoS flow(s) with the EPS
bearer context.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the PDU session type of the PDU session until the PDN
connection corresponding to the PDU session is released if the UE
supports non-IP PDN type and the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or
\"Unstructured\".

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the always-on PDU session indication.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the maximum number of supported packet filters until the
PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.4.3.3\]

The UE shall:

1\> if T390 is running:

2\> stop timer T390 for all access categories;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> if the *targetRAT-Type* is set to *eutra*:

2\> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;

2\> forward the *nas-SecurityParamFromNR* to the upper layers, if
included;

1\> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in
accordance with the specifications of the target RAT.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.4.3.4\]

Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE
shall:

1\> reset MAC;

1\> stop all timers that are running;

1\> release ran-NotificationAreaInfo, if stored;

1\> release the AS security context including the K~RRCenc~ key, the
K~RRCint~ key, the K~UPint~ key and the K~UPenc~ key, if stored;

1\> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and
the MAC configuration;

1\> if the E-UTRA *RRCConnectionReconfiguration* message included in the
received *MobilityFromNRCommand* does not include *fullConfig*:

2\> maintain source RAT configuration of PDCP and SDAP for applicable
RBs which is used for target RAT RBs;

1\> else:

2\> release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all
established RBs;

1\> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together
with the release cause \'other\'.

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.13.6.1\]

Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.

When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing
PDU Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF
has sent an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 in
TS 23.501 \[2\] and the UE has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not
supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends an indication towards the UE
during the Registration procedure that interworking without N26 is
supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 in TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice

1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.

2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for
voice reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).

3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and
decides to trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities,
indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" (received as part of initial context setup as defined in
TS 38.413 \[10\]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to trigger
fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.

NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including E-UTRAN as target.

NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for
voice is not possible\", then AN Release via inter-system redirection to
EPS is not performed in step 5.

4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Response message towards the PGW-C+SMF (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via V-SMF, in
case of roaming scenario) via AMF with an indication that mobility due
to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The PGW-C+SMF maintains the PCC
rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s).

5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), or AN
Release via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause
4.11.1.3.2), taking into account UE capabilities. The PGW-C+SMF reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause
4.11.1.2.1, or clause 4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS,
either 6a or 6b is executed

6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.2.1, and in
the case of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.1.3.2. In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure; or

6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26
interface, see clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag
\"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as
described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[13\] and has received the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported, then the UE
initiates Attach with PDN connectivity request with request type
\"handover\".

In inter-system redirection, the UE uses the emergency indication in the
RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 \[16\] and E-UTRAN
provides the emergency indication to MME during Tracking Area Update or
Attach procedure. For the handover procedure see clause 4.11.1.2.1,
step 1.

7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the
5GS to EPS handover procedure (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), the SMF/PGW
re-initiates the setup of the dedicated bearer for IMS voice, mapping
the 5G QoS to EPC QoS parameters. The PGW-C+SMF behaves as specified in
clause 4.9.1.3.1. The PGW-C+SMF reports about Successful Resource
Allocation and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.

8\. The IMS voice session establishment is continued.

At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is
configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.11.1.3.2\]

Clause 4.11.1.3.2 covers the case of idle mode mobility from 5GC to EPC.
UE performs Tracking Area Update procedure in E-UTRA/EPS when it moves
from NG-RAN/5GS to E-UTRA/EPS coverage area.

The procedure involves a Tracking Area Update to EPC and setup of
default EPS bearer and dedicated bearers in EPC in steps 1-11 and
re-activation, if required.

Figure 4.11.1.3.2-1: 5GS to EPS Idle mode mobility using N26 interface

The TAU procedure in TS 23.401 \[13\] is used with the following 5GS
interaction:

1\. Step 1 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with
Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 \[13\].

2\. Step 2 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with
Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 \[13\] with the modification captured in
clause 4.11.1.5.3.

3-4. Steps 3-4 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with
Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 \[13\].

5a. The AMF verifies the integrity of the TAU request message and
requests the PGW-C+SMF to provide SM Context by using
Nsmf\_PDUSession\_ContextRequest that also includes the mapped EPS
Bearer Contexts. The AMF provides the target MME capability to SMF in
the request to allow the SMF to determine whether to include EPS Bearer
context for non-IP PDN Type or not. This step is performed with all the
PGW-C+SMFs corresponding to PDU Sessions of the UE which are associated
with 3GPP access and have EBI(s) allocated to them. In this step, if the
AMF correctly validates the UE, then the AMF starts a timer.

NOTE 1: The AMF knows the MME capability to support non-IP PDN type or
not through local configuration.

5b. For Non-roaming or roaming with local breakout scenario, if CN
Tunnel Info is allocated by the PGW-U+UPF, the SMF sends N4 Session
Modification Request to PGW-U+UPF to establish the tunnel for each EPS
bearers, and PGW-U+UPF provides the PGW-U Tunnel Info for each EPS
bearers to PGW-C+SMF.

NOTE2: In home routed roaming case, the CN Tunnel Info for each EPS
bearer has been prepared by the PGW-C+SMF and provided to the V-SMF as
specified in clause 4.11.1.4.1.

5c. SMF returns mapped EPS bearer contexts, which includes PGW-C control
plane tunnel information of the PDN connection corresponding to the PDU
session, EBI for each EPS bearer, PGW-U tunnel information for each EPS
bearer, and EPS QoS parameters for each EPS bearer. For PDU Sessions
with PDU Session Type Ethernet or Unstructured, the SMF provides SM
Context for non-IP PDN Type.

6\. The AMF responds with a Context Response message carrying mapped MM
context (including mapped security context), Return preferred and SM EPS
UE Context (default and dedicated GBR bearers) to the MME. If the
verification of the integrity protection fails, the AMF returns an
appropriate error cause. Return preferred is an optional indication by
the AMF of a preferred return of the UE to the 5GS PLMN at a later
access change to a 5GS shared network. The AMF may start an
implementation specific (guard) timer for the UE context.

7 - 14. Steps 6-12 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure
with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 \[13\] are performed with following
addition and modification:

In the step 10, If the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule has
an EPS Bearer ID assigned, the PGW-C+SMF keeps the PDU Session (PDN
connection) and for the remaining QoS Flows that do not have EPS bearer
ID(s) assigned, the PGW-C+SMF deletes the PCC rule(s) associated with
those QoS Flows and informs the PCF about the removed PCC rule(s).

In the step 11, the PGW-C+SMF requests the PGW-U+UPF to establish the
tunnel for each EPS bearer by providing SGW-U Tunnel Info, and PGW-U
Tunnel Info if the PGW-U Tunnel Info is allocated by the PGW-C+SMF.

In step 10, the PGW-C+SMF may need to report some subscribed event to
the PCF by performing an SMF initiated SM Policy Association
Modification procedure as defined in clause 4.16.5.

Step 9a from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure with Serving
GW change) in TS 23.401 \[13\] with the modification captured in
clause 4.11.1.5.3

15a. The HSS+UDM invokes Nudm\_UECM\_DeregistrationNotification to
notify the AMF associated with 3GPP access with reason as
5GS to EPS Mobility. If the timer started in step 6 is not running, the
old AMF removes the UE context. Otherwise, the AMF may remove UE context
when the timer expires. The AMF request the release of the PDU Session
which is associated with 3GPP access, not expected to be transferred to
EPC, i.e. no EBI(s) allocated to them, and corresponding to the
PGW-C+SMF which is not contacted by AMF for SM context at step 5a. The
AMF requests the release of the SM context in the V-SMF only, for Home
Routed PDU Session with EBIs allocated. The 5GC may also keep UE context
to allow the use of native security parameters when UE moves back from
EPS to 5GS later.

Registration associated with the non-3GPP access in the AMF is not
removed (i.e. an AMF that was serving the UE over both 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses does not consider the UE as deregistered over non 3GPP access
and will remain registered and subscribed to subscription data updates
in UDM).

When the UE decides to deregister over non-3GPP access or the old AMF
decides not to maintain a UE registration for non-3GPP access anymore,
the old AMF then deregisters from UDM by sending a
Nudm\_UECM\_Deregistration service operation, unsubscribes from
Subscription Data updates by sending an Nudm\_SDM\_Unsubscribe service
operation to UDM and releases all the AMF and AN resources related to
the UE.

16 - 18. Steps 17-21 from clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update procedure
with Serving GW change) in TS 23.401 \[13\] with the following
modification:

The MME may provide the eNodeB with a PLMN list in the Handover
Restriction List taking into account the last used 5GS PLMN ID and the
Return preferred indication. The Handover Restriction List contains a
list of PLMN IDs as specified by TS 23.251 \[35\] clause 5.2a for eNodeB
functions.

The MME may not release the signalling connection with the UE based on
the indication received in the step 1 that the UE is moving from 5GC.

19\. \[conditional\] Step 19 from clause 4.11.1.2.1 applies.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.2\]

See subclause 5.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.1 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.4.2\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode when there is at least
one active PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.1, the UE shall enter substates
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and
initiate a tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.1.4.1\]

Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall create
the default EPS bearer context and the dedicated EPS bearer context(s)
based on the parameters of the mapped EPS bearer contexts or the
associations between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session,
if available. The EPS bearer identity assigned for the QoS flow of the
default QoS rule becomes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer
in the corresponding PDN connection. If there is no EPS bearer identity
assigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule, the UE shall release
locally the PDU session. If there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to
the QoS flow(s) which is not associated with the default QoS rule, the
UE shall locally delete the QoS rules and the QoS flow level QoS
parameters associated with the QoS flow(s). The UE uses the parameters
from each PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported to
create corresponding default EPS bearer context and optionally dedicated
EPS bearer context(s) as follows:

a\) the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
type of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is
\"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

2\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4\";

3\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv6\"; and

4\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4v6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4v6\";

b\) the PDU address of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
address of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to the PDU
address of the PDU session, if the PDU session type is \"IPv4\",
\"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\"; and

2\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to zero, if
the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

c\) the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default
EPS bearer context;

d\) the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR received in the parameters of the
default EPS bearer context of the mapped EPS bearer contexts shall be
mapped to the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR of the default EPS bearer
context;

e\) for each PDU session in state PDU SESSION ACTIVE, PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION PENDING or PDU SESSION INACTIVE PENDING the UE shall set
the state of the mapped EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE;
and

f\) for any other PDU session the UE shall set the state of the mapped
EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.

Additionally, for each mapped EPS bearer context or the association
between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session:

a\) the EPS bearer identity shall be set to the EPS bearer identity
received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS bearer identity
associated with the QoS flow;

b\) the EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped EPS QoS parameters
of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS
QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow;

c\) the extended EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped extended
EPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer
context, or the extended EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS
flow; and

d\) the traffic flow template shall be set to the mapped traffic flow
template of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or
the stored traffic flow template associated with the QoS flow, if
available.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall
associate the PDU session identity, the S-NSSAI, and the session-AMBR
with the default EPS bearer context, and for each EPS bearer context
mapped from one or more QoS flows, associate the QoS rule(s) for the QoS
flow(s) and the QoS flow description(s) for the QoS flow(s) with the EPS
bearer context.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the PDU session type of the PDU session until the PDN
connection corresponding to the PDU session is released if the UE
supports non-IP PDN type and the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or
\"Unstructured\".

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the always-on PDU session indication.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the maximum number of supported packet filters until the
PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.3.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon requesting establishment of an RRC connection:

2\> perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14
using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper
layers;

3\> if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;

1\> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values
are provided in *SIB1*;

1\> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in
9.2.2;

1\> apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;

1\> apply the timeAlignmentTimerCommon included in SIB1;

1\> start timer T300;

1\> initiate transmission of the *RRCSetupRequest* message in accordance
with 5.3.3.3;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

1\> set the *ue-Identity* as follows:

2\> if upper layers provide a 5G-S-TMSI:

3\> set the ue-Identity to ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part1;

2\> else:

3\> draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..2^39^-1 and set the
*ue-Identity* to this value;

NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the *5G-S-TMSI* if the UE is registered in
the TA of the current cell.

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

The UE shall continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as
cell re-selection evaluation. If the conditions for cell re-selection
are fulfilled, the UE shall perform cell re-selection as specified in
5.3.3.6.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.8.3\]

The UE shall:

...

1\> if the *RRCRelease* message includes *redirectedCarrierInfo*
indicating redirection to *eutra*:

2\> if *cnType* is included:

3\> after the cell selection, indicate the available CN Type(s) and the
received *cnType* to upper layers;

NOTE 1: Handling the case if the E-UTRA cell selected after the
redirection does not support the core network type specified by the
*cnType,* is up to UE implementation.

2\> if voiceFallbackIndication is included:

3\> consider the RRC connection release was for EPS fallback for IMS
voice (see TS 23.502 \[43\]);

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.11\]

The UE shall:

...

1\> else:

2\> if T302 is running:

3\> stop timer T302;

3\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

\[TS 38.304, clause 5.2.6\]

At reception of *RRCRelease* message to transition the UE to RRC\_IDLE
or RRC\_INACTIVE, UE shall attempt to camp on a suitable cell according
to *redirectedCarrierInfo* if included in the *RRCRelease* message. If
the UE cannot find a suitable cell, the UE is allowed to camp on any
suitable cell of the indicated RAT. If the *RRCRelease* message does not
contain the *redirectedCarrierInfo,* UE shall attempt to select a
suitable cell on an NR carrier. If no suitable cell is found according
to the above, the UE shall perform cell selection using stored
information in order to find a suitable cell to camp on.

When returning to RRC\_IDLE state after UE moved to RRC\_CONNECTED state
from *camped on any cell* state, UE shall attempt to camp on an
acceptable cell according to *redirectedCarrierInfo*, if included in the
*RRCRelease* message. If the UE cannot find an acceptable cell, the UE
is allowed to camp on any acceptable cell of the indicated RAT. If the
*RRCRelease* message does not contain *redirectedCarrierInfo* UE shall
attempt to select an acceptable cell on an NR frequency. If no
acceptable cell is found according to the above, the UE not in SNPN
Access Mode shall continue to search for an acceptable cell of any PLMN
in state *any cell selection*.

\[TS 36.304, clause 5.3.1\]

Cell status and cell reservations are indicated in the
*SystemInformationBlockType1* message (or
*SystemInformationBlockType1-BR* message or
*SystemInformationBlockType1-NB* message) TS 36.331 \[3\] by means of
the following fields:

\- ***cellBarred*** (IE type: \"barred\" or \"not barred\")\
This field indicates if the cell is barred for connectivity to EPC.\
This field is ignored by the UEs supporting *crs-IntfMitig* while
*crs-IntfMitigEnabled* is included in SIB1*.*\
This field is ignored by the BL UEs or UEs in CE supporting
*ce-CRS-IntfMitig* while *crs-IntfMigitNumPRBs* is included in SIB1-BR.\

common for all EPC PLMNs

NOTE: For IAB node, it ignores the *cellBarred*,
*cellReservedForOperatorUse* and *cellReservedForOtherUse* as defined in
TS 36.331 \[3\].

...

The following description for handling of barred and reserved cells is
per CN type. If the UE supports more than one CN type, the UE shall only
exclude a cell as candidate for selection/reselection if it is excluded
for both CN types.

NOTE: Fields cellBarred-CRS and **cellReservedForOperatorUse-CRS** are
not indicated in SystemInformationBlockType1-NB

When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\" and \"not reserved\" for
operator use,

\- All UEs shall treat this cell as candidate during the cell selection
and cell reselection procedures.

When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\" and \"reserved\" for
operator use for any PLMN,

\- UEs assigned to Access Class 11 or 15 operating in their HPLMN/EHPLMN
shall treat this cell as candidate during the cell selection and
reselection procedures if the field ***cellReservedForOperatorUse for
that PLMN set to \"reserved\".***

\- UEs assigned to an Access Class in the range of 0 to 9, 12 to 14
shall behave as if the cell status is \"barred\" in case the cell is
\"reserved for operator use\" for the registered PLMN or the selected
PLMN.

NOTE: ACs 11, 15 are only valid for use in the HPLMN/ EHPLMN; ACs 12,
13, 14 are only valid for use in the home country TS 22.011 \[4\].

When cell status \"barred\" is indicated or to be treated as if the cell
status is \"barred\",

\- The UE is not permitted to select/reselect this cell, not even for
emergency calls.

##### (1) {#section-25 .H6}

**with** {UE supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode and operating in
single-registration mode, and, the Network has indicated \"interworking
without N26 interface supported\", and, the UE is in in NR
RRC\_CONNECTED state }

**ensure that** {

**when** {User initiates a MMTEL call, the MO IMS voice session

*redirectedCarrierInfo* is found with cell status \"reserved for
operator use\" and another E-UTRA cell is found on another frequency
which is not \"reserved for operator use\" both cells belonging to the
UE\'s HPLMN}

**then** { UE selects the E-UTRA cell respecting the UE Access Class,

}

##### 11.1.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-15 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS23.502, clauses 4.11.2.2, 4.13.6.1; TS 24.501, clause
6.1.4.2; TS 38.331, clause 5.3.11, TS 38.304, clause 5.2.6. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.11.2.2\]

The following procedure is used by UEs in single-registration or dual
registration mode on mobility from 5GS to EPS.

In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID
according to clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.11.2.2-1: Mobility procedure from 5GS to EPS without N26
interface

The UE operating in single-registration mode can start the procedure
from Step 1 or Step 5. The UE operating in dual-registration mode starts
the procedure from Step 5.

NOTE 1: The network has indicated the \" Interworking without N26\" to
the UE. To support IP address preservation, the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 5. If the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 1, the IP
address preservation is not provided.

0\. UE is registered in 5GS and established PDU sessions. The FQDN for
the S5/S8 interface of the PGW-C+SMF is also stored in the UDM by the
PGW-C+SMF during PDU Session setup in addition to what is specified in
clause 4.3.2.2.1 and clause 4.3.2.2.2.

NOTE 2: At 5GS to EPS mobility, the MME use the FQDN for the S5/S8
interface of the PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF, and when UE moves back
from EPS to 5GS, the AMF uses FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the
PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF.

1\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

2\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\] with the following modifications:

The UE shall provide a EPS-GUTI that is mapped from the 5G-GUTI
following the mapping rules specified in TS 23.501 \[2\]. The UE
indicates that it is moving from 5GC.

3\. Step 3 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

4\. If the MME determined that the old node is an AMF based on UE\'s
GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the MME is configured to support 5GS-EPS
interworking without N26 procedure, the MME sends a TAU Reject to the
UE.

5\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\] with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

6\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

7\. Steps 4-7 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

8\. Step 8 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

9\. Step 11 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the following modifications:

The subscription profile the MME receives from HSS+UDM includes per
DNN/APN at most one PGW-C+SMF FQDN as described in in clause 5.17.2.1 in
TS 23.501 \[2\].

10\. Steps 12-24 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications as described in
clause 4.11.2.4.1.

11\. Step 25 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

12\. Step 26 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

13\. If the UE has remaining PDU Sessions in 5GS which it wants to
transfer to EPS and maintain the same IP address/prefix, the UE performs
the UE requested PDN Connectivity Procedure as specified in
TS 23.401 \[13\] clause 5.10.2 and sets the Request Type to \"handover\"
in Step 1 of the procedure with modification captured in clause
4.11.2.4.2. UE provides an APN and the PDU Session ID corresponding to
the PDU Session it wants to transfer to EPS. The UE provides the PDU
Session ID in PCO as described in clause 4.11.1.1.

UEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDU Session
immediately after completing the E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. UEs
in dual-registration mode may perform this step any time after the
completing of E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. Also, UEs in
dual-registration mode may perform this step only for a subset of PDU
Sessions.

The MME determines the PGW-C+SMF address for the Create Session Request
based on the APN received from the UE and the subscription profile
received from the HSS+UDM in Step 9 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the MME
for the new PGW-C+SMF ID in the updated subscription profile.

The PGW-C+SMF uses the PDU Session ID to correlate the transferred PDN
connection with the PDU Session in 5GC.

As a result of the procedure the PGW-U+UPF starts routing DL data
packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers
established for this PDN connection.

14\. The PGW-C+SMF initiates release of the PDU Session(s) in 5GS
transferred to EPS as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 with the following
clarification:

In step 2, the PGW-C+SMF shall not release IP address/prefix(es)
allocated for the PDU Session.

If UP connection of the PDU Session is not active, step 3b is not
executed, thus the steps triggered by step 3b are not executed;

If UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF invokes the
Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation without
including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command).

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.13.6.1\]

Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.

When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing
PDU Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF
has sent an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 in
TS 23.501 \[2\] and the UE has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not
supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends an indication towards the UE
during the Registration procedure that interworking without N26 is
supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 in TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice

1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.

2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for
voice reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).

3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and
decides to trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities,
indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" (received as part of initial context setup as defined in
TS 38.413 \[10\]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to trigger
fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.

NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including E-UTRAN as target.

NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for
voice is not possible\", then AN Release via inter-system redirection to
EPS is not performed in step 5.

4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Response message towards the PGW-C+SMF (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via V-SMF, in
case of roaming scenario) via AMF with an indication that mobility due
to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The PGW-C+SMF maintains the PCC
rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s).

5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), or AN
Release via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause
4.11.1.3.2), taking into account UE capabilities. The PGW-C+SMF reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause
4.11.1.2.1, or clause 4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS,
either 6a or 6b is executed

6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.2.1, and in
the case of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.1.3.2. In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure; or

6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26
interface, see clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag
\"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as
described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[13\] and has received the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported, then the UE
initiates Attach with PDN connectivity request with request type
\"handover\".

In inter-system redirection, the UE uses the emergency indication in the
RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 \[16\] and E-UTRAN
provides the emergency indication to MME during Tracking Area Update or
Attach procedure. For the handover procedure see clause 4.11.1.2.1,
step 1.

7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the
5GS to EPS handover procedure (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), the SMF/PGW
re-initiates the setup of the dedicated bearer for IMS voice, mapping
the 5G QoS to EPC QoS parameters. The PGW-C+SMF behaves as specified in
clause 4.9.1.3.1. The PGW-C+SMF reports about Successful Resource
Allocation and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.

8\. The IMS voice session establishment is continued.

At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is
configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.1.4.2\]

When the network does not support N26 interface, the SMF does not
provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer context for a PDU session.

NOTE 1: Since the SMF does not provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer
context for a PDU session, the UE does not know whether interworking
with EPS is supported for a PDU session before attempting to transfer
the PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode.

NOTE 2: It is up to UE implementation to decide which PDU session(s) to
be attempted to transfer from N1 mode to S1 mode, e.g. based on UE
policy or user preference.

Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, the
UE shall use the parameters from each PDU session which the UE intends
to transfer to EPS to create the contents of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message as follows:

a\) if the PDU session is an emergency PDU session, the request type
shall be set to \"handover of emergency bearer services\". Otherwise the
request type shall be set to \"handover\";

b\) the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
type of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is
\"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

2\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4\";

3\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv6\"; and

4\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4v6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4v6\";

c\) the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default
EPS bearer context; and

d\) the PDU session ID parameter in the PCO IE shall be set to the PDU
session identity of the PDU session.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall
associate the PDU session identity with the default EPS bearer context.

Upon successful completion of an EPS attach procedure after inter-system
change from N1 mode to S1 mode (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]), the UE shall
delete any UE derived QoS rules.

The UE shall locally release the PDU session(s) and QoS flow(s)
associated with the 3GPP access which have not been transferred to EPS.

...

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.11\]

UE shall:

1\> reset MAC;

1\> if T302 is running:

2\> stop timer T302;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> stop all timers that are running except T320 and T325;

1\> discard the UE Inactive AS context;

1\> set the variable *pendingRnaUpdate* to *false*, if that is set to
*true*;

1\> discard the K~gNB~, the K~RRCenc~ key, the K~RRCint~, the K~UPint~
key and the K~UPenc~ key, if any;

1\> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity,
the MAC configuration and the associated PDCP entity and SDAP for all
established RBs;

1\> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together
with the release cause;

1\> enter RRC\_IDLE and perform cell selection as specified in TS 38.304
\[20\], except if going to RRC\_IDLE was triggered by selecting an
inter-RAT cell while T311 was running;

1\> if going to RRC\_IDLE was triggered by reception of the *RRCRelease*
message including a *waitTime*:

2\> start timer T302 with the value set to the *waitTime*;

2\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\'.

\[TS 38.304, clause 5.2.6\]

At reception of *RRCRelease* message to transition the UE to RRC\_IDLE
or RRC\_INACTIVE, UE shall attempt to camp on a suitable cell according
to *redirectedCarrierInfo* if included in the *RRCRelease* message. If
the UE cannot find a suitable cell, the UE is allowed to camp on any
suitable cell of the indicated RAT. If the *RRCRelease* message does not
contain the *redirectedCarrierInfo,* UE shall attempt to select a
suitable cell on an NR carrier. If no suitable cell is found according
to the above, the UE shall perform cell selection using stored
information in order to find a suitable cell to camp on.

When returning to RRC\_IDLE state after UE moved to RRC\_CONNECTED state
from *camped on any cell* state, UE shall attempt to camp on an
acceptable cell according to *redirectedCarrierInfo*, if included in the
*RRCRelease* message. If the UE cannot find an acceptable cell, the UE
is allowed to camp on any acceptable cell of the indicated RAT. If the
*RRCRelease* message does not contain *redirectedCarrierInfo* UE shall
attempt to select an acceptable cell on an NR frequency. If no
acceptable cell is found according to the above, the UE not in SNPN
Access Mode shall continue to search for an acceptable cell of any PLMN
in state *any cell selection*.

MT IMS voice session establishment has been initiated and the UE
receives a RRCRelease message which includes redirectedCarrierInfo
indicating redirection to eutra }

**then** { UE selects the E-UTRA cell, performs an ATTACH or a TAU
procedure, **and**, successfully completes the MT MMTEL call setup in
EPS }

specified in: TS23.502, clauses 4.11.2.2, 4.13.6.1; TS 24.501, clauses
4.5.4.1, 4.8.2.3; TS 38.331, clause 5.3.11. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.11.2.2\]

The following procedure is used by UEs in single-registration or dual
registration mode on mobility from 5GS to EPS.

In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID
according to clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.11.2.2-1: Mobility procedure from 5GS to EPS without N26
interface

The UE operating in single-registration mode can start the procedure
from Step 1 or Step 5. The UE operating in dual-registration mode starts
the procedure from Step 5.

NOTE 1: The network has indicated the \"Interworking without N26\" to
the UE. To support IP address preservation, the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 5. If the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 1, the IP
address preservation is not provided.

0\. UE is registered in 5GS and established PDU sessions. The FQDN for
the S5/S8 interface of the PGW-C+SMF is also stored in the UDM by the
PGW-C+SMF during PDU Session setup in addition to what is specified in
clause 4.3.2.2.1 and clause 4.3.2.2.2.

NOTE 2: At 5GS to EPS mobility, the MME use the FQDN for the S5/S8
interface of the PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF, and when UE moves back
from EPS to 5GS, the AMF uses FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the
PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF.

1\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

2\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\] with the following modifications:

The UE shall provide a EPS-GUTI that is mapped from the 5G-GUTI
following the mapping rules specified in TS 23.501 \[2\]. The UE
indicates that it is moving from 5GC.

3\. Step 3 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

4\. If the MME determined that the old node is an AMF based on UE\'s
GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the MME is configured to support 5GS-EPS
interworking without N26 procedure, the MME sends a TAU Reject to the
UE.

5\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\] with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

6\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

7\. Steps 4-7 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

8\. Step 8 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

9\. Step 11 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the following modifications:

The subscription profile the MME receives from HSS+UDM includes per
DNN/APN at most one PGW-C+SMF FQDN as described in in clause 5.17.2.1 in
TS 23.501 \[2\].

10\. Steps 12-24 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\], with the modifications as described in
clause 4.11.2.4.1.

11\. Step 25 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

12\. Step 26 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in
TS 23.401 \[13\].

13\. If the UE has remaining PDU Sessions in 5GS which it wants to
transfer to EPS and maintain the same IP address/prefix, the UE performs
the UE requested PDN Connectivity Procedure as specified in
TS 23.401 \[13\] clause 5.10.2 and sets the Request Type to \"handover\"
in Step 1 of the procedure with modification captured in clause
4.11.2.4.2. UE provides an APN and the PDU Session ID corresponding to
the PDU Session it wants to transfer to EPS. The UE provides the PDU
Session ID in PCO as described in clause 4.11.1.1.

UEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDU Session
immediately after completing the E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. UEs
in dual-registration mode may perform this step any time after the
completing of E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. Also, UEs in
dual-registration mode may perform this step only for a subset of PDU
Sessions.

The MME determines the PGW-C+SMF address for the Create Session Request
based on the APN received from the UE and the subscription profile
received from the HSS+UDM in Step 9 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the MME
for the new PGW-C+SMF ID in the updated subscription profile.

The PGW-C+SMF uses the PDU Session ID to correlate the transferred PDN
connection with the PDU Session in 5GC.

As a result of the procedure the PGW-U+UPF starts routing DL data
packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers
established for this PDN connection.

14\. The PGW-C+SMF initiates release of the PDU Session(s) in 5GS
transferred to EPS as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 with the following
clarification:

In step 2, the PGW-C+SMF shall not release IP address/prefix(es)
allocated for the PDU Session.

If UP connection of the PDU Session is not active, step 3b is not
executed, thus the steps triggered by step 3b are not executed;

If UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF invokes the
Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation without
including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command).

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.13.6.1\]

Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.

When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing
PDU Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF
has sent an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 in
TS 23.501 \[2\] and the UE has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not
supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends an indication towards the UE
during the Registration procedure that interworking without N26 is
supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 in TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice

1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.

2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for
voice reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).

3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and
decides to trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities,
indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" (received as part of initial context setup as defined in
TS 38.413 \[10\]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to trigger
fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.

NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including E-UTRAN as target.

NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for
voice is not possible\", then AN Release via inter-system redirection to
EPS is not performed in step 5.

4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Response message towards the PGW-C+SMF (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via V-SMF, in
case of roaming scenario) via AMF with an indication that mobility due
to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The PGW-C+SMF maintains the PCC
rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s).

5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.6.1), or AN
Release via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause
4.11.1.3.2), taking into account UE capabilities. The PGW-C+SMF reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause
4.11.1.6.1, or clause 4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS,
either 6a or 6b is executed

6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.6.1, and in
the case of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.1.3.2. In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure; or

6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26
interface, see clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag
\"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as
described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[13\] and has received the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported, then the UE
initiates Attach with PDN connectivity request with request type
\"handover\".

In inter-system redirection, the UE uses the emergency indication in the
RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 \[16\] and E-UTRAN
provides the emergency indication to MME during Tracking Area Update or
Attach procedure. For the handover procedure see clause 4.11.1.6.1,
step 1.

7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the
5GS to EPS handover procedure (see clause 4.11.1.6.1), the SMF/PGW
re-initiates the setup of the dedicated bearer for IMS voice, mapping
the 5G QoS to EPC QoS parameters. The PGW-C+SMF behaves as specified in
clause 4.9.1.3.1. The PGW-C+SMF reports about Successful Resource
Allocation and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.

8\. The IMS voice session establishment is continued.

At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is
configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.3\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode when:（
PDU SEESION ACTIVE）

a\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type and at least one PDU session is
active; or

b\) the UE does not support non-IP PDN type and at least one PDU session
of IPv4, IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type is active,

the UE shall proceed as follows:

a\) if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\"
to transfer a PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE has
received an \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" indication
from the network, the UE shall:

1\) enter substates EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

2\) map the PDU session(s) which the UE intends to transfer to EPS to
the default EPS bearer context of the corresponding PDN connection(s) as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.2; and

3\) initiate an EPS attach procedure and include a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\" in the ATTACH
REQUEST message to activate a default EPS bearer context for one of the
active PDU sessions which the UE intends to transfer to EPS.

After successful completion of the EPS attach procedure, the UE shall
reset the registration attempt counter and the attach attempt counter
(see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]) and attempt to activate each of the other
default EPS bearer contexts, if any, by initiating a stand-alone PDN
connectivity procedure with request type set to \"handover\" in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message; and

b\) otherwise, enter substates EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and initiate a tracking area update
procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode
when:（NO PDU SESSION）

a\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type and no PDU session is active; or

b\) the UE does not support non-IP PDN type and no PDU session of IPv4,
IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU session type is active,

the UE shall enter substates EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE, and initiate an attach procedure.

At inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE
shall:

a\) enter substate 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and substate
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

b\) map the default EPS bearer context(s) of the PDN connection(s) which
the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, to the corresponding PDU
session(s) as specified in subclause 6.1.4.2; and

c\) initiate the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update indicating \"mobility registration updating\" in the
5GS registration type IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see
subclause 5.5.1.3).

After having successfully registered in N1 mode the UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter and the attach attempt counter (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]) and:

a\) if the UE supports the PDU session establishment procedure with
request type set to \"existing PDU session\" to transfer a PDN
connection from S1 mode to N1 mode and the UE has received an
\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" indication from the
network, attempt to transfer the PDN connection(s) which the UE intends
to transfer to 5GS, if any, from S1 mode to N1 mode by initiating the
PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to \"existing
PDU session\"; and

b\) otherwise, establish PDU session(s) corresponding to the PDN
connection(s) which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, by
initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set
to \"initial request\".

See subclause 5.1.4.3 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.11\]

UE shall:

1\> reset MAC;

1\> if T302 is running:

2\> stop timer T302;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> stop all timers that are running except T320 and T325;

1\> discard the UE Inactive AS context;

1\> set the variable *pendingRnaUpdate* to *false*, if that is set to
*true*;

1\> discard the K~gNB~, the K~RRCenc~ key, the K~RRCint~, the K~UPint~
key and the K~UPenc~ key, if any;

1\> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity,
the MAC configuration and the associated PDCP entity and SDAP for all
established RBs;

1\> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together
with the release cause;

1\> enter RRC\_IDLE and perform cell selection as specified in TS 38.304
\[20\], except if going to RRC\_IDLE was triggered by selecting an
inter-RAT cell while T311 was running;

1\> if going to RRC\_IDLE was triggered by reception of the *RRCRelease*
message including a *waitTime*:

2\> start timer T302 with the value set to the *waitTime*;

2\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\'.

##### 11.1.7.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-17 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclauses 5.6.1.1, 5.6.1.2, 5.6.1.4; TS
23.502 \[31\], subclause 4.13.4.2; TS 24.301 \[21\], subclauses 4.4.2.3,
5.5.3.2.2 and TS 24.229 \[44\] subclause U.2.2.6.4. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

NOTE: Conformance requirements in regard to establishing an emergency
call in EPS are not provided. This can be found in IMS Emergency tests
specified in TS 36.523-1 \[13\].

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.6.1.1\]

The UE shall invoke the service request procedure when:

\...

h\) the UE, in 5GMM-IDLE, 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access, or
5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication, receives a request for
emergency services fallback from the upper layer and performs emergency
services fallback as specified in subclause 4.13.4.2 of
3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\]; or

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.6.1.2\]

For case h) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall send a SERVICE REQUEST
message with service type set to \"emergency services fallback\".

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.6.1.4\]

For case h) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the indication from
the lower layers when the UE has changed to S1 mode or E-UTRA connected
to 5GCN (see 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\]) as successful completion of the
procedure and stop timer T3517.

\[TS 23.502, subclause 4.13.4.2\]

The call flow in Figure 4.13.4.2-1 describes the procedure for emergency
services fallback.

Figure 4.13.4.2-1: Emergency Services Fallback

1\. UE camps on E-UTRA or NR cell in the 5GS (in either CM\_IDLE or
CM\_CONNECTED state).

2\. UE has a pending IMS emergency session request (e.g. voice) from the
upper layers.

3\. If the AMF has indicated support for emergency services using
fallback via the Registration Accept message for the current RAT, the UE
sends a Service Request message indicating that it requires emergency
services fallback.

\...

5\. Based on the target CN indicated in message 4, one of the following
procedures is executed by NG-RAN:

\...

5b. NG-RAN initiates handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1) or redirection to
E-UTRAN connected to EPS. NG-RAN uses the security context provided by
the AMF to secure the redirection procedure.

If the redirection procedure is used either in 5a or 5b the target CN is
also conveyed to the UE in order to be able to perform the appropriate
NAS procedures (S1 or N1 Mode).

\[TS 24.301, subclause 4.4.2.3\]

Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is
usually established by the MME during the attach procedure by initiating
a security mode control procedure. After successful completion of the
security mode control procedure, all NAS messages exchanged between the
UE and the MME are sent integrity protected using the current EPS
security algorithms, and except for the messages specified in
subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent ciphered using the current EPS security algorithms.

\...

During inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, if
the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and:

1\) if the tracking area updating procedure is initiated as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], the UE shall transmit a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message integrity protected with the current 5G NAS security
context and the UE shall derive a mapped EPS security context (see
subclause 8.6.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 \[56\]). The UE shall include the eKSI
indicating the 5G NAS security context value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.

After receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including the
eKSI, the MME forwards the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the
source AMF, if possible, to obtain the mapped EPS security context from
the AMF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[56\]. The MME re-establishes
the secure exchange of NAS messages by either:

\- replying with a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that is integrity
protected and ciphered using the mapped EPS NAS security context. From
this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in
subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent ciphered; or

\[TS 24.301, subclause 5.5.3.2.2\]

The UE in state EMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the tracking area updating
procedure by sending a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the MME,

\...

z\) when the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in
EMM-IDLE mode, the UE operates in single-registration mode, and
conditions specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\] apply;

\...

zd) when the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in
EMM-CONNECTED mode.

For all cases except case b, the UE shall set the EPS update type IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to \"TA updating\". For case b,
the UE shall set the EPS update type IE to \"periodic updating\".

\...

When initiating a tracking area updating procedure while in S1 mode, the
UE shall use the current EPS NAS integrity key to integrity protect the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, unless the UE is performing
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode.

\...

If a UE has established PDN connection(s) and uplink user data pending
to be sent via user plane when it initiates the tracking area updating
procedure, or uplink signalling not related to the tracking area
updating procedure when the UE does not support control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, it may also set an \"active\" flag in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message to indicate the request to establish the user
plane to the network and to keep the NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

\...

If the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall include the
eKSI (either KSI~ASME~ or KSI~SGSN~) in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. Otherwise, the UE shall set
the NAS Key Set Identifier IE to the value \"no key is available\". If
the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall integrity
protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the current EPS
security context. Otherwise the UE shall not integrity protect the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

\...

For the case z and zd, the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall be
integrity protected using the 5GS security context available in the UE.
The UE shall include a GUTI, mapped from 5G-GUTI (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[54\] and 3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\]), in the Old GUTI IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. In addition, the UE shall
include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI set to \"Native GUTI\", and the UE
shall include a UE status IE with a 5GMM registration status set to \"UE
is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state\".

When the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode,
the UE may also include an EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, indicating which EPS bearer contexts are
active in the UE. The UE shall include the EPS bearer context status IE
in TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message:

\- \...

\- for the case z; and

\...

If the UE initiates the first tracking area updating procedure following
an initial registration in N1 mode and the UE is operating in the
single-registration mode, the UE shall include a UE radio capability
information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

\...

If the UE supports NB-S1 mode, Non-IP PDN type, or N1 mode, then the UE
shall support the extended protocol configuration options IE.

For all cases except case b, if the UE supports the extended protocol
configuration options IE, then the UE shall set the ePCO bit to
\"extended protocol configuration options supported\" in the UE network
capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

\...

For all cases except case b, if the UE supports dual connectivity with
NR, then the UE shall set the DCNR bit to \"dual connectivity with NR
supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and shall include the UE additional security capability
IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

\...

For all cases except case b, if the UE supports N1 mode, the UE shall
set the N1mode bit to \"N1 mode supported\" in the UE network capability
IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and shall include the UE
additional security capability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

\[TS 24.229, subclause U.2.2.6.4\]

NOTE: This subclause covers only the case where the UE selects the IM CN
subsystem in accordance with the conventions and rules specified in
3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\] and describes the IP-CAN specific procedure. It
does not preclude the use of CS domain. When a CS system based on
3GPP TS 24.008 \[8\] is to be used, clause B.5 applies.

When the UE operates in single-registration mode as described in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[258\] and the UE recognises that a call request is an
emergency call, if:

1\) the IM CN subsystem is selected in accordance with the conventions
and rules specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]; and

2\) the UE is currently registered to the 5GS services while the UE is
in an NR cell connected to 5GCN;

then the following treatment is applied:

1\) if the EMC indicates \"Emergency services not supported\":

a\) if the UE supports emergency services fallback as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 \[257\] and the emergency services fallback is available
(i.e., \"ESFB is Y\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]), the UE
shall attempt emergency services fallback as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[258\]. If the UE receives from the lower layers an
indication that the emergency services fallback attempt failed, the UE
may behave as described in bullet b) below assuming that the emergency
services fallback is not available;

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.13.6.1\]

Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.

When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing
PDU Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF
has sent an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 in
TS 23.501 \[2\] and the UE has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not
supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends an indication towards the UE
during the Registration procedure that interworking without N26 is
supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 in TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice

1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.

2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for
voice reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).

3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and
decides to trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities,
indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" (received as part of initial context setup as defined in
TS 38.413 \[10\]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to trigger
fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.

NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including E-UTRAN as target.

NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for
voice is not possible\", then AN Release via inter-system redirection to
EPS is not performed in step 5.

4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Modification Response message towards the PGW-C+SMF (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via
V-SMF, in the case of home routed roaming scenario) via AMF with an
indication that mobility due to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The
PGW-C+SMF maintains the PCC rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s) and
reports the EPS Fallback event to the PCF if PCF has subscribed to this
event.

5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), or AN
Release via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause
4.11.1.3.2), taking into account UE capabilities. The PGW-C+SMF reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause
4.11.1.2.1, or clause 4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS,
either 6a or 6b is executed

6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.2.1, and in
the case of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.1.3.2. In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure; or

6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26
interface, see clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag
\"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as
described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[13\] and has received the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported, then the UE
initiates Attach with PDN connectivity request with request type
\"handover\".

In inter-system redirection, the UE uses the emergency indication in the
RRC message as specified in clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 \[16\] and E-UTRAN
provides the emergency indication to MME during Tracking Area Update or
Attach procedure. For the handover procedure see clause 4.11.1.2.1,
step 1.

7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the
5GS to EPS handover procedure (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), the SMF/PGW
re-initiates the setup of the dedicated bearer(s) for the maintained PCC
rule(s) in step 4 including of the dedicated bearer for IMS voice,
mapping the 5G QoS to EPC QoS parameters. The PGW-C+SMF behaves as
specified in clause 4.9.1.3.1. The PGW-C+SMF reports about Successful
Resource Allocation and Access Network Information if subscribed by PCF.

The IMS signalling related to IMS voice call establishment continues
after step 1 as specified in the TS 23.228 \[55\].

At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is
configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.2\]

See subclause 5.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.1 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

If the UE supports S1 mode, the UE shall:

\- set the S1 mode bit to \"S1 mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

\- include the S1 UE network capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message; and

\- if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\" to
transfer a PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode, set the HO attach bit to
\"attach request message containing PDN connectivity request with
request type set to handover to transfer PDU session from N1 mode to S1
mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the UE included S1 mode supported indication in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message, the AMF supporting interworking with EPS shall set the
IWK N26 bit to either:

a\) \"interworking without N26 interface not supported\" if the AMF
supports N26 interface ; or

b\) \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" if the AMF does not
support N26 interface

in the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message.

The UE supporting S1 mode shall operate in the mode for interworking
with EPS as follows:

a\) if the IWK N26 bit in the 5GS network feature support IE is set to
\"interworking without N26 interface not supported\", the UE shall
operate in single-registration mode;

b\) if the IWK N26 bit in the 5GS network feature support IE is set to
\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE supports
dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or

NOTE 3: The registration mode used by the UE is implementation
dependent.

c\) if the IWK N26 bit in the 5GS network feature support IE is set to
\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE only
supports single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in
single-registration mode.

The UE shall treat the received interworking without N26 interface
indicator for interworking with EPS as valid in the entire PLMN and its
equivalent PLMN(s).

The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such
as IMS voice over PS session, emergency services or emergency services
fallback, in the 5GS network feature support information element. In a
UE with IMS voice over PS session capability, the IMS voice over PS
session indicator, the Emergency services support indicator, and the
Emergency services fallback indicator shall be provided to the upper
layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator
into account when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or
calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take the
IMS voice over PS session indicator, the Emergency services support
indicator, and the Emergency services fallback indicator into account
for the access domain selection.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.4.2\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode when there is at least
one active PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.1, the UE shall enter substates
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and
initiate a tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.1.4.1\]

Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall create
the default EPS bearer context and the dedicated EPS bearer context(s)
based on the parameters of the mapped EPS bearer contexts or the
associations between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session,
if available. The EPS bearer identity assigned for the QoS flow of the
default QoS rule becomes the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer
in the corresponding PDN connection. If there is no EPS bearer identity
assigned to the QoS flow of the default QoS rule, the UE shall release
locally the PDU session. If there is no EPS bearer identity assigned to
the QoS flow(s) which is not associated with the default QoS rule, the
UE shall locally delete the QoS rules and the QoS flow level QoS
parameters associated with the QoS flow(s). The UE uses the parameters
from each PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported to
create corresponding default EPS bearer context and optionally dedicated
EPS bearer context(s) as follows:

a\) the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
type of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is
\"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

2\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4\";

3\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv6\"; and

4\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4v6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4v6\";

b\) the PDU address of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
address of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to the PDU
address of the PDU session, if the PDU session type is \"IPv4\",
\"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\"; and

2\) the PDN address of the default EPS bearer context is set to zero, if
the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

c\) the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default
EPS bearer context;

d\) the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR received in the parameters of the
default EPS bearer context of the mapped EPS bearer contexts shall be
mapped to the APN-AMBR and extended APN-AMBR of the default EPS bearer
context;

e\) for each PDU session in state PDU SESSION ACTIVE, PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION PENDING or PDU SESSION INACTIVE PENDING the UE shall set
the state of the mapped EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE;
and

f\) for any other PDU session the UE shall set the state of the mapped
EPS bearer context(s) to BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.

Additionally, for each mapped EPS bearer context or the association
between QoS flow and mapped EPS bearer in the PDU session:

a\) the EPS bearer identity shall be set to the EPS bearer identity
received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS bearer identity
associated with the QoS flow;

b\) the EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped EPS QoS parameters
of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or the EPS
QoS parameters associated with the QoS flow;

c\) the extended EPS QoS parameters shall be set to the mapped extended
EPS QoS parameters of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer
context, or the extended EPS QoS parameters associated with the QoS
flow; and

d\) the traffic flow template shall be set to the mapped traffic flow
template of the EPS bearer received in the mapped EPS bearer context, or
the stored traffic flow template associated with the QoS flow, if
available.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall
associate the PDU session identity, the S-NSSAI, and the session-AMBR
with the default EPS bearer context, and for each EPS bearer context
mapped from one or more QoS flows, associate the QoS rule(s) for the QoS
flow(s) and the QoS flow description(s) for the QoS flow(s) with the EPS
bearer context.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the PDU session type of the PDU session until the PDN
connection corresponding to the PDU session is released if the UE
supports non-IP PDN type and the PDU session type is \"Ethernet\" or
\"Unstructured\".

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the always-on PDU session indication.

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE and the SMF
shall maintain the maximum number of supported packet filters until the
PDN connection corresponding to the PDU session is released.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.4.3.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the
target radio access technology:

2\> if the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO:

3\> store handover failure information in *VarRLF-Report according to
5.3.10.5;*

2\> if voiceFallbackIndication is included in the MobilityFromNRCommand
*message*:

3\> attempt to select an E-UTRA cell:

4\> if a suitable E-UTRA cell is selected:

5\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11,
with release cause \'RRC connection failure\';

##### (1) {#section-30 .H6}

**with** { UE being in NR RRC\_CONNECTED state after having requested an
MMTEL call establishment and the MO IMS voice session establishment has
been initiated }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE receives an RRCRelease message which includes
redirectedCarrierInfo indicating redirection to E-UTRA and with
voiceFallbackIndication }

**then** {UE selects the E-UTRA cell, uses "mo-VoiceCall" as the
establishment cause value in RRC Connection Request, performs a TAU
procedure, and, successfully completes the MMTEL call setup in EPS }

}

##### 11.1.9.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-19 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.5.4.1; TS 38.331, clause 5.3.8.3,
5.3.11. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication, upon receiving a request from the upper layers for an access
attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access attempt into access
identities and an access category following:

a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or

b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2.1,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

If the UE is registered for 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS
optimization has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions
when it builds a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message as initial NAS
message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions as specified
in subclause 5.6.1.2.2, regardless of the access category for which the
access barring check is performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.8.3\]

The UE shall:

1\> delay the following actions defined in this sub-clause 60 ms from
the moment the *RRCRelease* message was received or optionally when
lower layers indicate that the receipt of the *RRCRelease* message has
been successfully acknowledged, whichever is earlier;

1\> stop timer T380, if running;

1\> stop timer T320, if running;

1\> if timer T316 is running;

2\> stop timer T316;

2\> clear the information included in *VarRLF-Report,* if any;

1\> stop timer T350, if running;

1\> if the AS security is not activated:

2\> ignore any field included in *RRCRelease* message except *waitTime*;

2\> perform the actions upon going to RRC\_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11
with the release cause \'other\' upon which the procedure ends;

1\> if the *RRCRelease* message includes *redirectedCarrierInfo*
indicating redirection to *eutra*:

2\> if *cnType* is included:

3\> after the cell selection, indicate the available CN Type(s) and the
received *cnType* to upper layers;

NOTE 1: Handling the case if the E-UTRA cell selected after the
redirection does not support the core network type specified by the
*cnType,* is up to UE implementation.

2\> if voiceFallbackIndication is included:

3\> consider the RRC connection release was for EPS fallback for IMS
voice (see TS 23.502 \[43\]);

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.11\]

UE shall:

1\> reset MAC;

##### 11.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-20 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in TS 23.216, clause 6.5.4, TS 38.331, clause 5.4.3.3
and TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 23.216, clause 6.5.4\]

Depicted in Figure 6.5.4-1 is a call flow for 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to
3GPP UTRAN.

Figure 6.5.4-1: 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to 3GPP UTRAN call flow

1\. UE establishes the PDU session for IMS.

2\. 5G-SRVCC HO is triggered by NG-RAN.

3\. NG-RAN sends a Handover Required (Target ID, generic Source to
Target Transparent Container, 5G-SRVCC HO indication) message to the
source AMF. The Target ID is the UTRAN RNC-ID. 5G-SRVCC HO Indication
indicates to AMF that this if for 5G-SRVCC. The Generic Source to Target
Transparent Container is the Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
container.

4\. AMF determines the HO is used for 5G-SRVCC by the 5G-SRVCC HO
Indication. AMF selects an MME\_SRVCC that can have Sv connection to the
MSC SERVER/MSC according to the target RNC ID which is included in the
Target ID.

NOTE: The MME\_SRVCC selection can be realised through operator\'s
configuration.

5\. AMF sends the forward relocation request (IMSI, Target ID, STN-SR,
C-MSISDN, MM Context, Generic Source to Target Transparent Container,
5G-SRVCC HO Indication, Supported Codec IE, MS ClassMark 2, Emergency
Indication, Equipment Identifier) to MME\_SRVCC. The Emergency
Indication and the equipment identifier are included if the ongoing
session is emergency session. Authenticated IMSI and C MSISDN are also
included in this case, if available.

6\. MME\_SRVCC initiates the PS-CS handover procedure towards MSC
Server. Steps 5 to 13 as specified in Figure 6.2.2.1-1 (referenced by
clause 6.2.2.1A SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN without PS HO) are performed
for the PS-CS handover procedure.

7\. MME\_SRVCC receives the response message from MSC server after HO
preparation is completed. MME\_SRVCC sends the Forward Relocation
Response message (Target to Source Transparent Container) to AMF.

8\. AMF sends the HO command to NG-RAN.

9\. NG-RAN sends a HO command to the UE. UE detects the 5G-SRVCC HO.

10\. UE tunes to the target UTRAN cell.

11\. Handover Detection at the target RNS occurs, then the target RNS
sends Handover Detection message to the target MSC SERVER/MSC.

12\. The UE sends a Handover Complete message via the target RNS to the
target MSC SERVER. Steps 19 to 21as specified in Figure 6.2.2.1-1
(referenced by clause 6.2.2.1A SRVCC from E-UTRAN to UTRAN without PS
HO) are performed for this handover complete procedure. At this stage,
the target MSC SERVER/MSC can send/receive voice data.

13\. MSC SERVER sends MME\_SRVCC the SRVCC PS to CS completion.

14\. MME\_SRVCC forwards the Forward Relocation completion message which
includes the information received in step 13 to AMF.

15\. AMF forwards the Forward Relocation Complete ACK message to
MME\_SRVCC. AMF releases the UE context related to MME\_SRVCC.

16\. MME\_SRVCC forwards the PS to CS Complete ACK message to MSC
server. MME\_SRVCC removes stored UE context. After receives the
message, MSC server removes the UE context related to the MME\_SRVCC.

17\. AMF performs the PDU session release procedure for all the PDU
session(s) which is described in TS 23.502 \[45\] indicating that the
release is due to PS to CS handover for 5G SRVCC.

18\. For an emergency services session after handover is complete, the
source AMF or the MSC Server may respectively invoke the
Namf\_Location\_EventNotify service operation or send a Subscriber
Location Report, towards a GMLC associated with the source or target
side, respectively, carrying the identity of the MSC Server, as defined
respectively in TS 23.273 \[50\] or TS 23.271 \[29\], to support
location continuity.

The IMS service control is described in TS 23.292 \[13\] when UE
accesses in UTRAN cell due to 5G-SRVCC.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.4.3.3\]

Reception of the MobilityFromNRCommand by the UE

The UE shall:

1\> stop timer T310, if running;

1\> stop timer T312, if running;

1\> if T316 is running:

2\> stop timer T316;

2\> clear the information included in *VarRLF-Report*, if any;

1\> if T390 is running:

2\> stop timer T390 for all access categories;

2\> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

1\> if the *targetRAT-Type* is set to *eutra*:

2\> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;

2\> forward the *nas-SecurityParamFromNR* to the upper layers, if
included;

1\> else if the *targetRAT-Type* is set to *utra-fdd*:

2\> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards UTRA-FDD;

2\> forward the *nas-SecurityParamFromNR* to the upper layers, if
included;

1\> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in
accordance with the specifications of the target RAT.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE performs initial registration for 5GS services;

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

c\) when the UE performs initial registration for SMS over NAS; and

d\) when the UE moves from GERAN to NG-RAN coverage or the UE moves from
a UTRAN to NG-RAN coverage and the following applies:

1\) the UE initiated a GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure
while in A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or

2\) the UE has performed 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN as specified in
3GPP TS 23.216 \[6A\],

and since then the UE did not perform a successful EPS attach or
tracking area updating procedure in S1 mode or registration procedure in
N1 mode,

##### 11.3.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-21 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2, 4.5.4.2 and 4.5.6 and TS 38.331:
clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 1 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the

applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the determined
access category as specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the
determined access category is an operator-defined access category, then
the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according
to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access
identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the standardized access category
determined for the operator-defined access category as described in
subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a handover resulting in change of PCell in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE
shall defer access barring checks until it has obtained valid UAC
information (from *SIB1*) from the target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* and the
*uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* contains an *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with
the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper
layers (see TS 24.501 \[23\]):

4\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper layers;

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if uac-BarringForCommon is applicable or the uac-ACBarringListType
indicates that uac-ExplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the
UAC-BarringPerCat:

6\> select the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected UAC-BarringInfoSet as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else if the uac-ACBarringListType indicates that
uac-ImplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> select the *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex* corresponding to the Access
Category in the *uac-ImplicitACBarringList*;

4\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-BarringInfoSetIndex:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

5\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

3\> if timer T302 is running:

4\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\', upon which the
procedure ends;

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T302 expires or is stopped, and if timer T390 corresponding
to an Access Category is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to an Access Category other than \'2\'
expires or is stopped, and if timer T302 is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to the Access Category \'2\' expires or
is stopped:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

1\> when barring for an Access Category is considered being alleviated:

2\> if the Access Category was informed to upper layers as barred:

3\> inform upper layers about barring alleviation for the Access
Category.

2\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\':

3\> perform actions specified in 5.3.13.8;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' uniformly distributed in the range:
0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> if \'*rand*\' is lower than the value indicated by
*uac-BarringFactor* included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value
calculated as follows, using the *uac-BarringTime* included in \"AC
barring parameter\":

T390 = (0.7+ 0.6 ~\*~ *rand*) ~\*~ *uac-BarringTime.*

##### 11.3.1a.2 Conformance requirements {#a.2-conformance-requirements-2 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2, 4.5.4.2, 4.5.2A and 4.5.6 and TS
38.331: clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 1 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 2 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2, the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2A\]

\[Rel-16\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2A.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected SNPN, if a new SNPN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RSNPN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 1 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 2 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access classes 11 to 15 in the SNPN.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2A.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.2\]

\[Rel-15\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication, upon detecting one of events 1) through 6) listed
in subclause 4.5.1, the NAS shall categorize the corresponding access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.2.3,
and provide the access identities and the access category to the lower
layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this request to
the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer the RRC
establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6 of this
specification.

NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message for the
access attempt, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 2: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the access attempt is allowed;

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to
send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message;

c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the NAS
transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

d\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to modify an existing PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the
NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message;

e\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to
re-establish the user-plane resources for an existing PDU session, 5GMM
shall initiate the service request procedure as specified in
subclause 5.6.1; and

f\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an uplink user
data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane
resources, 5GMM shall consider that the uplink user data packet is
allowed to be sent.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category;

NOTE 3: In this case prohibiting the initiation of the MMTEL voice
session, MMTEL video session or prohibiting sending of the SMS over IP
is performed by the upper layers.

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall not
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to
send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message. Upon receiving an
indication from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the
access category with which the access attempt was associated, 5GMM may
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to
send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message, if still needed;

c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall not initiate the
NAS transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that the
barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access
attempt was associated, the NAS may initiate the NAS transport procedure
as specified in subclause 5.4.5, if still needed;

d\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to modify an existing PDU session modification, 5GMM shall
not initiate the NAS transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message. Upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS may initiate the NAS
transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5, if still needed;

e)- if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to
re-establish the user-plane resources for an existing PDU session, the
NAS shall not initiate the service request procedure as specified in
subclause 5.6.1. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that
the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access
attempt was associated, the NAS may initiate the service request
procedure as specified in subclause 5.6.1, if still needed; and

f\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an uplink user
data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane
resources, 5GMM shall consider that the uplink user data packet is not
allowed to be sent. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers
that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the
access attempt was associated, the NAS shall consider that the barring
is alleviated for the access category.

\[Rel-16\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication, upon detecting one of events 1) through 8) listed
in subclause 4.5.1, the NAS shall categorize the corresponding access
attempt into access identities and an access category following:

a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
subclause 4.5.2.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or

b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the access identities and the access category to the lower
layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this request to
the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer the RRC
establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6 of this
specification.

NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 2: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication, an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, or an
MO-IMS-registration-related-signalling-started indication, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the access attempt is allowed;

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to
send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message;

c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the NAS

NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message;

e\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to
re-establish the user-plane resources for an existing PDU session, 5GMM
shall initiate the service request procedure as specified in
subclause 5.6.1;

f\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an uplink user
data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane
resources, 5GMM shall consider that the uplink user data packet is
allowed to be sent;

g\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated location request, 5GMM shall
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in clause 5.4.5 to
send an LCS message in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message; and

h\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated signalling transaction towards
the PCF by sending an UL NAS TRANSPORT message including a UE policy
container (see 3GPP TS 24.587 \[19B\]), 5GMM shall initiate the NAS
transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the
signalling transaction via an UL NAS TRANSPORT message.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, or an
MO-IMS-registration-related-signalling-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category;

NOTE 3: In this case prohibiting the initiation of the MMTEL voice
session, MMTEL video session or prohibiting sending of the SMS over IP
or the IMS registration related signalling is performed by the upper
layers.

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall not
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to
send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message. Upon receiving an
indication from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the
access category with which the access attempt was associated, 5GMM may
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to
send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message, if still needed;

c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall not initiate the
NAS transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that the
barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access
attempt was associated, the NAS may initiate the NAS transport procedure
as specified in subclause 5.4.5, if still needed;

d\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to modify an existing PDU session modification, 5GMM shall
not initiate the NAS transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message. Upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS may initiate the NAS
transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5, if still needed;

e\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to
re-establish the user-plane resources for an existing PDU session, the
NAS shall not initiate the service request procedure as specified in
subclause 5.6.1. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers that
the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access
attempt was associated, the NAS may initiate the service request
procedure as specified in subclause 5.6.1, if still needed;

f\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an uplink user
data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane
resources, 5GMM shall consider that the uplink user data packet is not
allowed to be sent. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers
that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the
access attempt was associated, the NAS shall consider that the barring
is alleviated for the access category;

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the determined
access category as specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the
determined access category is an operator-defined access category, then
the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according
to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access
identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the standardized access category
determined for the operator-defined access category as described in
subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a PCell change in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE shall defer access barring
checks until it has obtained *SIB1* (as specified in 5.2.2.2) from the
target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* that contains a
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* for the selected PLMN or SNPN:

4\> if the procedure in 5.2.2.4.2 for a selected PLMN resulted in use of
information in *npn-IdentityInfoList* and *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* has an
entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to used information in
this list:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to used information in the *npn-IdentityInfoList*;4\>
else:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the selected PLMN and the *PLMN-IdentityInfo, if any,*
or the selected SNPN and the *npn-IdentityInfoList*;

3\> if any *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry is selected:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if uac-BarringForCommon is applicable or the uac-ACBarringListType
indicates that uac-ExplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the
UAC-BarringPerCat:

6\> select the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected UAC-BarringInfoSet as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else if the uac-ACBarringListType indicates that
uac-ImplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> select the *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex* corresponding to the Access
Category in the *uac-ImplicitACBarringList*;

4\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-BarringInfoSetIndex:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

5\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

3\> if timer T302 is running:

4\> if timer T390 is running for Access Category \'2\':

5\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\', upon which the procedure
ends;

4\> else

5\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\', upon which the
procedure ends;

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T302 expires or is stopped, and if timer T390 corresponding
to an Access Category is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to an Access Category other than \'2\'
expires or is stopped, and if timer T302 is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to the Access Category \'2\' expires or
is stopped:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

1\> when barring for an Access Category is considered being alleviated:

2\> if the Access Category was informed to upper layers as barred:

3\> inform upper layers about barring alleviation for the Access
Category.

2\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\':

3\> perform actions specified in 5.3.13.8;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' uniformly distributed in the range:
0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> if \'*rand*\' is lower than the value indicated by
*uac-BarringFactor* included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value
calculated as follows, using the *uac-BarringTime* included in \"AC
barring parameter\":

T390 = (0.7+ 0.6 ~\*~ *rand*) ~\*~ *uac-BarringTime.*

##### 11.3.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-22 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2, 4.5.4.1 and 4.5.6 and TS 38.331:
clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 1 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 2 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2, the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the determined
access category as specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the
determined access category is an operator-defined access category, then
the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according
to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access
identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the standardized access category
determined for the operator-defined access category as described in
subclause 4.5.3.

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a handover resulting in change of PCell in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE
shall defer access barring checks until it has obtained valid UAC
information (from *SIB1*) from the target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* and the
*uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* contains an *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with
the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper
layers (see TS 24.501 \[23\]):

4\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper layers;

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

...

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

3\> if timer T302 is running:

4\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\', upon which the
procedure ends;

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T302 expires or is stopped, and if timer T390 corresponding
to an Access Category is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to an Access Category other than \'2\'
expires or is stopped, and if timer T302 is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to the Access Category \'2\' expires or
is stopped:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

1\> when barring for an Access Category is considered being alleviated:

2\> if the Access Category was informed to upper layers as barred:

3\> inform upper layers about barring alleviation for the Access
Category.

2\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\':

3\> perform actions specified in 5.3.13.8;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' uniformly distributed in the range:
0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> if \'*rand*\' is lower than the value indicated by
*uac-BarringFactor* included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value
calculated as follows, using the *uac-BarringTime* included in \"AC
barring parameter\":

T390 = (0.7+ 0.6 ~\*~ *rand*) ~\*~ *uac-BarringTime.*

##### 11.3.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-23 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331, clause 5.3.13.2, 5.3.13.8, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4
and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.13.2\]

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers or AS (when responding
to RAN paging or upon triggering RNA updates while the UE is in
RRC\_INACTIVE) requests the resume of a suspended RRC connection.

The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system
information as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this
procedure.

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

...

1\> else if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered due to an
RNA update as specified in 5.3.13.8:

2\> if an emergency service is ongoing:

NOTE: How the RRC layer in the UE is aware of an ongoing emergency
service is up to UE implementation.

3\> select \'2\' as the Access Category;

3\> set the resumeCause to emergency;

2\> else:

3\> select \'8\' as the Access Category;

2\> perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14
using the selected Access Category and one or more Access Identities to
be applied as specified in TS 24.501 \[23\];

3\> if the access attempt is barred:

4\> set the variable *pendingRnaUpdate* to *true*;

4\> the procedure ends;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.13.8\]

In RRC\_INACTIVE state, the UE shall:

1\> if T380 expires; or

1\> if RNA Update is triggered at reception of SIB1, as specified in
5.2.2.4.2:

2\> initiate RRC connection resume procedure in 5.3.13.2 with
*resumeCause* set to *rna-Update*;

1\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\', as specified in
5.3.14.4:

2\> if upper layers do not request RRC the resumption of an RRC
connection, and

2\> if the variable *pendingRnaUpdate* is set to *true*:

3\> initiate RRC connection resume procedure in 5.3.13.2 with
*resumeCause* value set to *rna-Update*.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

...

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if uac-BarringForCommon is applicable or the uac-ACBarringListType
indicates that uac-ExplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the
UAC-BarringPerCat:

6\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

The UE shall:

...

1\> else if timer T390 corresponding to an Access Category other than
\'2\' expires or is stopped, and if timer T302 is not running:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

...

1\> when barring for an Access Category is considered being alleviated:

2\> if the Access Category was informed to upper layers as barred:

3\> inform upper layers about barring alleviation for the Access
Category.

2\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\':

3\> perform actions specified in 5.3.13.8;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' uniformly distributed in the range:
0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> if \'*rand*\' is lower than the value indicated by
*uac-BarringFactor* included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value
calculated as follows, using the *uac-BarringTime* included in \"AC
barring parameter\":

T390 = (0.7+ 0.6 ~\*~ *rand*) ~\*~ *uac-BarringTime.*

**with** { UE in NR RRC\_IDLE not configured for special AIs (1,2,11-15)
having received a SIB1 message including UAC set to 0% accessibility for
Access Category 3 }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE finds a new cell (AC 3) with SIB1 containing UAC Barring
Info Per PLMN with Implicit AC Barring List }

**then** { UE does not access the new cell until access barring is
alleviated }

}

##### 11.3.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-24 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clause 4.5.2, 4.5.2A, 4.5.4.1 and 5.5.1.3.7, TS
38.331 clause 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

...

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2A\]

\[Rel-16\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2A.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected SNPN, if a new SNPN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RSNPN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access classes 11 to 15 in the SNPN.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2A.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

\[Rel-15\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

...

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[Rel-16\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication, upon receiving a request from the upper layers for an access
attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access attempt into access
identities and an access category following:

a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or

b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2.1,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

If the UE is registered for 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS
optimization has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions
when it builds a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message as initial NAS
message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions as specified
in subclause 5.6.1.2.2, regardless of the access category for which the
access barring check is performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.7\]

b\) The lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred.

The UE shall not start the registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update. The UE stays in the current serving cell
and applies the normal cell reselection process.

The registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
is started, if still needed, when the lower layers indicate that the
barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access
attempt was associated.

ba) The lower layers indicate that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories 0 and 2 and the access category with
which the access attempt was associated is other than 0 and 2.

If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message has not been sent, the UE shall
proceed as specified for case b. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message has
been sent, the UE shall proceed as specified for case e and,
additionally, the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update is started, if still needed, when the lower layers
indicate that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated. For additional UE requirements
for both cases see subclause 4.5.5.

##### 11.3.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-25 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2, 4.5.4.1 and 4.5.6 and TS 38.331:
clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 1 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 2 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2, the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the determined
access category as specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the
determined access category is an operator-defined access category, then
the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according
to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access
identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the standardized access category
determined for the operator-defined access category as described in
subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a handover resulting in change of PCell in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE
shall defer access barring checks until it has obtained valid UAC
information (from *SIB1*) from the target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* and the
*uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* contains an *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with
the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper
layers (see TS 24.501 \[23\]):

4\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper layers;

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if uac-BarringForCommon is applicable or the uac-ACBarringListType
indicates that uac-ExplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the
UAC-BarringPerCat:

6\> select the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected UAC-BarringInfoSet as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else if the uac-ACBarringListType indicates that
uac-ImplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> select the *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex* corresponding to the Access
Category in the *uac-ImplicitACBarringList*;

4\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-BarringInfoSetIndex:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

5\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

3\> if timer T302 is running:

4\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\', upon which the
procedure ends;

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T302 expires or is stopped, and if timer T390 corresponding
to an Access Category is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to an Access Category other than \'2\'
expires or is stopped, and if timer T302 is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to the Access Category \'2\' expires or
is stopped:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

1\> when barring for an Access Category is considered being alleviated:

2\> if the Access Category was informed to upper layers as barred:

3\> inform upper layers about barring alleviation for the Access
Category.

2\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\':

3\> perform actions specified in 5.3.13.8;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' uniformly distributed in the range:
0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> if \'*rand*\' is lower than the value indicated by
*uac-BarringFactor* included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

##### 11.3.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-26 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2, 4.5.4.1 and 4.5.6 and TS 38.331:
clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 1 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 2 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2, the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the determined
access category as specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the
determined access category is an operator-defined access category, then
the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according
to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access
identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the standardized access category
determined for the operator-defined access category as described in
subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a handover resulting in change of PCell in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE
shall defer access barring checks until it has obtained valid UAC
information (from *SIB1*) from the target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* and the
*uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* contains an *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with
the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper
layers (see TS 24.501 \[23\]):

4\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper layers;

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if uac-BarringForCommon is applicable or the uac-ACBarringListType
indicates that uac-ExplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the
UAC-BarringPerCat:

6\> select the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected UAC-BarringInfoSet as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else if the uac-ACBarringListType indicates that
uac-ImplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> select the *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex* corresponding to the Access
Category in the *uac-ImplicitACBarringList*;

4\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-BarringInfoSetIndex:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

5\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

3\> if timer T302 is running:

4\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\', upon which the
procedure ends;

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T302 expires or is stopped, and if timer T390 corresponding
to an Access Category is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to an Access Category other than \'2\'
expires or is stopped, and if timer T302 is not running; or

1\> if timer T390 corresponding to the Access Category \'2\' expires or
is stopped:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

1\> when barring for an Access Category is considered being alleviated:

2\> if the Access Category was informed to upper layers as barred:

3\> inform upper layers about barring alleviation for the Access
Category.

2\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\':

3\> perform actions specified in 5.3.13.8;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' uniformly distributed in the range:
0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> if \'*rand*\' is lower than the value indicated by
*uac-BarringFactor* included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value
calculated as follows, using the *uac-BarringTime* included in \"AC
barring parameter\":

T390 = (0.7+ 0.6 ~\*~ *rand*) ~\*~ *uac-BarringTime.*

##### 11.3.6a.2 Conformance requirements {#a.2-conformance-requirements-3 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2A, 4.5.4.1 and 4.5.6 and TS 38.331:
clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2A\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2A.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected SNPN, if a new SNPN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RSNPN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 1 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 2 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access classes 11 to 15 in the SNPN.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2A.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication, upon receiving a request from the upper layers for an access
attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access attempt into access
identities and an access category following:

a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or

b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2.1,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

If the UE is registered for 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS
optimization has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions
when it builds a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message as initial NAS
message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions as specified
in subclause 5.6.1.2.2, regardless of the access category for which the
access barring check is performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\" and the UE has not disabled its
E-UTRA capability as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\], the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]; or

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication or an
MO-IMS-registration-related-signalling-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]; or

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

c\) if the access attempt is for emergency:

1\) the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access attempt is
barred.

NOTE 4: This can result in the upper layers requesting another emergency
call attempt using domain selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[6\]
and 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\].

NOTE 5: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.2A) and the
determined access category by checking the rules specified in
table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the access attempt matches more than
one rule, the RRC establishment cause of the lowest rule number shall be
used. If the determined access category is an operator-defined access
category, then the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be
selected according to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or
more access identities (see subclauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.2A) and the
standardized access category determined for the operator-defined access
category as described in subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer. This procedure does not apply to IAB-MT. This
procedure does not apply to L2 U2N Relay UE initiating RRC connection
establishment or RRC connection resume upon reception of any message
from a L2 U2N remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1 in accordance to 5.3.3.1a
or 5.3.13.1a.

After a PCell change in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE shall defer access barring
checks until it has obtained *SIB1* (as specified in 5.2.2.2) from the
target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* that contains a
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* for the selected PLMN or SNPN:

4\> if the procedure in 5.2.2.4.2 for a selected PLMN resulted in use of
information in *npn-IdentityInfoList* and *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* has an
entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to used information in
this list:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to used information in the *npn-IdentityInfoList*;

4\> else:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the selected PLMN and the *PLMN-IdentityInfo, if any,*
or the selected SNPN and the *npn-IdentityInfoList*;

3\> if any *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry is selected:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if *uac-BarringForCommon* is applicable or the
*uac-ACBarringListType* indicates that *uac-ExplicitACBarringList* is
used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the *uac-BarringInfoSetList* contains a *UAC-BarringInfoSet*
entry corresponding to the selected *uac-barringInfoSetIndex* in the
*UAC-BarringPerCat*:

6\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else if the *uac-ACBarringListType* indicates that
*uac-ImplicitACBarringList* is used:

4\> select the *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex* corresponding to the Access
Category in the *uac-ImplicitACBarringList*;

4\> if the *uac-BarringInfoSetList* contains the *UAC-BarringInfoSet*
entry corresponding to the selected *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex*:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

5\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

3\> if timer T302 is running:

4\> if timer T390 is running for Access Category \'2\':

5\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\', upon which the procedure
ends;

4\> else

5\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\', upon which the
procedure ends;

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

clause 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5, TS 22.101 clause 10.1.1. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

...

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication, upon receiving a request from the upper layers for an access
attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access attempt into access
identities and an access category following:

a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or

b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

...

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

...

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

...

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* and the
*uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* contains an *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with
the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to the PLMN or SNPN selected by
upper layers (see TS 24.501 \[23\]):

4\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the PLMN or to the SNPN selected by upper layers;

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if uac-BarringForCommon is applicable or the uac-ACBarringListType
indicates that uac-ExplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the
UAC-BarringPerCat:

6\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else if the uac-ACBarringListType indicates that
uac-ImplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> select the *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex* corresponding to the Access
Category in the *uac-ImplicitACBarringList*;

4\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-BarringInfoSetIndex:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

5\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

...

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' uniformly distributed in the range:
0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> if \'*rand*\' is lower than the value indicated by
*uac-BarringFactor* included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

2\> draw a random number \'*rand*\' that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ *rand* \< 1;

2\> start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value
calculated as follows, using the *uac-BarringTime* included in \"AC
barring parameter\":

T390 = (0.7+ 0.6 ~\*~ *rand*) ~\*~ *uac-BarringTime.*

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 1 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 2 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2, the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2A\]

\[Rel-16\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
table 4.5.2A.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
applicable in the selected SNPN, if a new SNPN is selected, or otherwise
if it is applicable in the RSNPN; and

b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
identity 0 is applicable.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 1 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 2 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access classes 11 to 15 in the SNPN.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2A.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.1\]

\[Rel-15\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, upon receiving a request from the
upper layers for an access attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.3,
and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall not initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt. Additionally:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication or an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and the UE\'s
usage setting is \"voice centric\", the UE may attempt to select an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to make a PDN connection
providing access to IMS available; see subclause 4.8.2 and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category with
which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the upper
layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category and may
initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message, if still needed;
and

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:

1\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE may
attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a
suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, it then proceeds with the
appropriate EMM specific procedures and, if necessary, ESM procedures to
make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available; see
subclause 4.8.2 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

2\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and ESM
procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS available;
see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];

3\) otherwise, the NAS layer shall notify the upper layers that the
access attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication
from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access
category and may initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message,
if still needed.

NOTE 4: Barring timers, on a per access category basis, are run by the
lower layers. At expiry of barring timers, the indication of alleviation
of access barring is indicated to the NAS on a per access category
basis.

\[Rel-16\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication, upon receiving a request from the upper layers for an access
attempt, the NAS shall categorize the access attempt into access
identities and an access category following:

a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or

b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the applicable access identities and the access category to
the lower layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this
request to the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6
of this specification.

NOTE 1: The access barring check is performed by the lower layers.

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as initial
NAS message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2.1,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

If the UE is registered for 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS
optimization has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions
when it builds a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message as initial NAS
message, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions as specified
in subclause 5.6.1.2.2, regardless of the access category for which the
access barring check is performed.

NOTE 3: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall initiate the procedure to send the initial NAS message for the
access attempt.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the determined
access category as specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the
determined access category is an operator-defined access category, then
the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according
to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access
identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the standardized access category
determined for the operator-defined access category as described in
subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a handover resulting in change of PCell in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE
shall defer access barring checks until it has obtained valid UAC
information (from *SIB1*) from the target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else:

2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* that contains a
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* for the selected PLMN or SNPN:

4\> if the procedure in 5.2.2.4.2 for a selected PLMN resulted in use of
information in *npn-IdentityInfoList* and *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* has an
entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to used information in
this list:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to used information in the *npn-IdentityInfoList*;

4\> else:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the selected PLMN and the *PLMN-IdentityInfo, if any,*
or the selected SNPN and the *npn-IdentityInfoList*;

3\> if any *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry is selected:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if *uac-BarringForCommon* is applicable or the
*uac-ACBarringListType* indicates that *uac-ExplicitACBarringList* is
used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the *uac-BarringInfoSetList* contains a *UAC-BarringInfoSet*
entry corresponding to the selected *uac-barringInfoSetIndex* in the
*UAC-BarringPerCat*:

##### 11.3.9.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-29 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.3 and TS 38.331: clause 5.3.14.1,
5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.3\]

Operator-defined access category definitions can be signalled to the UE
using NAS signalling. Each operator-defined access category definition
consists of the following parameters:

a\) a precedence value which indicates in which order the UE shall
evaluate the operator-defined category definition for a match;

b\) an operator-defined access category number, i.e. access category
number in the 32-63 range that uniquely identifies the access category
in the PLMN in which the access categories are being sent to the UE;

c\) criteria consisting of one or more access category criteria type and
associated access category criteria type values. The access category
criteria type can be set to one of the following:

1\) DNN;

2\) OS Id + OS App Id of application triggering the access attempt; or

3\) S-NSSAI; and

NOTE 1: An access category criteria type can be associated with more
than one access category criteria values.

d\) optionally, a standardized access category. This standardized access
category is used in combination with the access identities of the UE to
determine the RRC establishment cause as specified in subclause 4.5.6.

An access attempt matches the criteria of an operator-defined access
category definition, if the access attempt matches all access category
criteria types included in the criteria with any of the associated
access criteria type values.

Each operator-defined access category definition has a different
precedence value.

Several operator-defined access category definitions can have the same
operator-defined access category number.

If:

\- an access category in bullet d) is not provided;

\- an access category in bullet d) is provided and is not a standardized
access category; or

\- an access category in bullet d) is provided, is a standardized access
category and is not recognized by the UE;

the UE shall use instead:

\- access category 3 (MO\_sig) if the access attempt is triggered by
uplink signalling; or

\- access category 7 (MO\_data) if the access attempt is triggered by
uplink data

in combination with the access identities of the UE to determine the RRC
establishment cause as specified in subclause 4.5.6.

The operator-defined access category definitions are valid in the PLMN
which provided them and in a PLMN equivalent to the PLMN which provided
them, as specified in annex C.

If the UE stores operator-defined access category definitions valid in
the selected PLMN or the RPLMN, then access control in 5GMM-IDLE mode
will only be performed for the event a) defined in subclause 4.5.1. If
the transition from 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access to 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode is due to a UE NAS initiated 5GMM specific procedure, then this
access attempt shall be mapped to one of the standardized access
categories in the range \< 32, see subclause 4.5.2. I.e. for this case
the UE shall skip the checking of operator-defined access category
definitions.

If the UE is stores operator-defined access category definitions valid
in the selected PLMN or the RPLMN, then access control in 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication will only
be performed for the events 1) to 6) defined in subclause 4.5.1.

The UE shall handle the operator-defined access category definitions
stored for the RPLMN as specified in subclause 5.4.4.3,
subclause 5.5.1.2.4, and subclause 5.5.1.3.4.

When the UE is switched off, the UE shall keep the operator-defined
access category definitions so that the operator-defined access category
definitions can be used after switch on.

When the UE selects a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the previously
selected PLMN, the UE shall stop using the operator-defined access
category definitions stored for the previously selected PLMN and should
keep the operator-defined access category definitions stored for the
previously selected PLMN.

NOTE 2: When the UE selects a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the
previously selected PLMN, the UE can delete the operator-defined access
category definitions stored for the previously selected PLMN e.g. if
there is no storage space in the UE.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a PCell change in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE shall defer access barring
checks until it has obtained *SIB1* (as specified in 5.2.2.2) from the
target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:

2\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
\'2\' nor \'0\':

*uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* contains an *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with
the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper
layers (see TS 24.501 \[23\]):

4\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex*
corresponding to the PLMN selected by upper layers;

4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
(i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> if uac-BarringForCommon is applicable or the uac-ACBarringListType
indicates that uac-ExplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> if the corresponding *UAC-BarringPerCatList* contains a
*UAC-BarringPerCat* entry corresponding to the Access Category:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerCat* entry;

5\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains a UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-barringInfoSetIndex in the
UAC-BarringPerCat:

6\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

6\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

5\> else:

6\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else if the uac-ACBarringListType indicates that
uac-ImplicitACBarringList is used:

4\> select the *uac-BarringInfoSetIndex* corresponding to the Access
Category in the *uac-ImplicitACBarringList*;

4\> if the uac-BarringInfoSetList contains the UAC-BarringInfoSet entry
corresponding to the selected uac-BarringInfoSetIndex:

5\> select the *UAC-BarringInfoSet* entry;

5\> perform access barring check for the Access Category as specified in
5.3.14.5, using the selected *UAC-BarringInfoSet* as \"UAC barring
parameter\";

4\> else:

5\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

3\> else:

4\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> if the access barring check was requested by upper layers:

2\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

3\> if timer T302 is running:

4\> if timer T390 is running for Access Category \'2\':

5\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\', upon which the procedure
ends;

4\> else

5\> inform the upper layer that access barring is applicable for all
access categories except categories \'0\' and \'2\', upon which the
procedure ends;

3\> else:

4\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is barred, upon which the procedure ends;

2\> else:

3\> inform upper layers that the access attempt for the Access Category
is allowed, upon which the procedure ends;

1\> else:

2\> the procedure ends.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.4\]

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T302 expires or is stopped:

2\> for each Access Category for which T390 is not running:

3\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated:

1\> else if timer T390 corresponding to an Access Category other than
\'2\' expires or is stopped, and if timer T302 is not running:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

1\> else if timer T390 corresponding to the Access Category \'2\'
expires or is stopped:

2\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated;

1\> when barring for an Access Category is considered being alleviated:

2\> if the Access Category was informed to upper layers as barred:

3\> inform upper layers about barring alleviation for the Access
Category.

2\> if barring is alleviated for Access Category \'8\':

3\> perform actions specified in 5.3.13.8;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> draw a random number \'rand\' uniformly distributed in the range: 0
≤ rand \< 1;

2\> if \'rand\' is lower than the value indicated by uac-BarringFactor
included in \"UAC barring parameter\":

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

2\> else:

3\> consider the access attempt as barred;

1\> if the access attempt is considered as barred:

2\> draw a random number \'rand\' that is uniformly distributed in the
range 0 ≤ rand \< 1;

2\> start timer T390 for the Access Category with the timer value
calculated as follows, using the uac-BarringTime included in \"AC
barring parameter\":

T390 = (0.7+ 0.6 ~\*~ *rand*) ~\*~ *uac-BarringTime.*

##### 11.3.9a.2 Conformance requirements {#a.2-conformance-requirements-4 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.3 and TS 38.331: clause 5.3.14.1,
5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.3\]

Operator-defined access category definitions can be signalled to the UE
using NAS signalling. Each operator-defined access category definition
consists of the following parameters:

a\) a precedence value which indicates in which order the UE shall
evaluate the operator-defined category definition for a match;

b\) an operator-defined access category number, i.e. access category
number in the 32-63 range that uniquely identifies the access category
in the PLMN or SNPN in which the access categories are being sent to the
UE;

c\) criteria consisting of one or more access category criteria type and
associated access category criteria type values. The access category
criteria type can be set to one of the following:

1\) DNN;

2\) Void

3\) OS Id + OS App Id of application triggering the access attempt; or

4\) S-NSSAI; and

NOTE 1: An access category criteria type can be associated with more
than one access category criteria values.

d\) optionally, a standardized access category. This standardized access
category is used in combination with the access identities of the UE to
determine the RRC establishment cause as specified in subclause 4.5.6.

If the access attempt is to establish a new PDU session i.e. it is
triggered by:

\- a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for
the purpose of PDU session establishment unless the request triggered a
service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode or
5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode; or

\- a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode
or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
triggered by a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT
message for the purpose of PDU session establishment,

then:

\- the access attempt matches access category criteria type DNN if the
DNN requested by the UE during the PDU session establishment procedure
matches any of the access criteria type values associated with the
access criteria type DNN; and

\- the access attempt matches access category criteria type S-NSSAI if
the S-NSSAI requested by the UE during the PDU session establishment
procedure matches any of the access criteria type values associated with
the access criteria type S-NSSAI.

If the access attempt is for an existing PDU session i.e. it is
triggered by:

\- a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT message for
the purpose of PDU session modification unless the request triggered a
service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode or
5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode;

\- a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode
or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
triggered by a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT
message for the purpose of PDU session modification;

\- a service request procedure to transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode
or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
triggered by a request from upper layers to send an UL NAS TRANSPORT
message for the purpose of PDU session release;

\- a service request procedure requesting user-plane resources for a PDU
session; or

\- an uplink user data packet is to be sent for a PDU session with
suspended user-plane resources,

then:

\- the access attempt matches access category criteria type DNN if the
DNN provided by the network in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message matches any of the access criteria type values associated with
the access criteria type DNN; and

\- the access attempt matches access category criteria type S-NSSAI if
the S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session matches any of the access
criteria type values associated with the access criteria type S-NSSAI.

An access attempt matches the criteria of an operator-defined access
category definition, if the access attempt matches all access category
criteria types included in the criteria with any of the associated
access criteria type values.

Each operator-defined access category definition has a different
precedence value.

Several operator-defined access category definitions can have the same
operator-defined access category number.

If:

\- an access category in bullet d) is not provided;

\- an access category in bullet d) is provided and is not a standardized
access category; or

\- an access category in bullet d) is provided, is a standardized access
category and is not recognized by the UE;

the UE shall use instead access category 7 (MO\_data) in combination
with the access identities of the UE to determine the RRC establishment
cause as specified in subclause 4.5.6.

The operator-defined access category definitions are valid in the PLMN
which provided them and in a PLMN equivalent to the PLMN which provided
them, or in the SNPN which provided them, as specified in annex C.

If the UE stores operator-defined access category definitions valid in
the selected PLMN or the RPLMN, or valid in the selected SNPN or RSNPN,
then access control in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication will only be performed for the event a) defined in
subclause 4.5.1. If the transition from 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode
with suspend indication over 3GPP access to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode is due
to a UE NAS initiated 5GMM specific procedure, then this access attempt
shall be mapped to one of the standardized access categories in the
range \< 32, see subclause 4.5.2. I.e. for this case the UE shall skip
the checking of operator-defined access category definitions.

If the UE stores operator-defined access category definitions valid in
the selected PLMN or the RPLMN, or valid in the selected SNPN or RSNPN,
then access control in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
with RRC inactive indication will only be performed for the events 1) to
6) defined in subclause 4.5.1.

The UE shall handle the operator-defined access category definitions
stored for the RPLMN or RSNPN as specified in subclause 5.4.4.3,
subclause 5.5.1.2.4, and subclause 5.5.1.3.4.

When the UE is switched off, the UE shall keep the operator-defined
access category definitions so that the operator-defined access category
definitions can be used after switch on.

When the UE selects a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the previously
selected PLMN, or selects a new SNPN, the UE shall stop using the
operator-defined access category definitions stored for the previously
selected PLMN or SNPN and should keep the operator-defined access
category definitions stored for the previously selected PLMN or SNPN.

NOTE 2: When the UE selects a new PLMN which is not equivalent to the
previously selected PLMN, or selects a new SNPN, the UE can delete the
operator-defined access category definitions stored for the previously
selected PLMN or SNPN e.g. if there is no storage space in the UE.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer. This procedure does not apply to IAB-MT. This
procedure does not apply to L2 U2N Relay UE initiating RRC connection
establishment or RRC connection resume upon reception of any message
from a L2 U2N remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1 in accordance to 5.3.3.1a
or 5.3.13.1a.

After a PCell change in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE shall defer access barring
checks until it has obtained *SIB1* (as specified in 5.2.2.2) from the
target cell.

*UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
included in *SIB1*;

3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:

The UE shall:

1\> if timer T302 expires or is stopped:

2\> for each Access Category for which T390 is not running:

3\> consider the barring for this Access Category to be alleviated:

##### 11.3.10.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-30 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2, 4.5.4.2 and 4.5.6 and TS 38.331:
clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

> a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
> table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
> applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or
> otherwise if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and
>
> b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
> identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if
the EHPLMN list is present) prior to receiving the MPS indicator bit of
the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
being set to \"Access identity 1 valid\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the
EHPLMN list is present), the contents of the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and the rules specified in
table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability of access identity
1. When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the
EHPLMN list is present), and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does not
indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid. When the UE
is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is
present), and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured
for access identity 1, the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature
support IE is not applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its
HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of
the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if
the EHPLMN list is present) prior to receiving the MCS indicator bit of
the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
being set to \"Access identity 2 valid\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the
EHPLMN list is present), the contents of the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and the rules specified in
table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability of access identity
2. When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the
EHPLMN list is present), and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does not
indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid. When the UE
is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is
present), and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured
for access identity 2, the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature
support IE is not applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its
HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of
the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ are not applicable.

When the UE is in its HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is
empty) or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of
the USIM file EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability
of access classes 11 and 15. When the UE is not in its HPLMN (if the
EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN
list is present), access classes 11 and 15 are not applicable.

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
file EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and the rules
specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the applicability of
access classes 12 - 14. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN,
access classes 12-14 are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.2\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication, upon detecting one of events 1) through 8) listed
in subclause 4.5.1, the NAS shall categorize the corresponding access
attempt into access identities and an access category following:

> a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
> subclause 4.5.2.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or
>
> b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
> subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the access identities and the access category to the lower
layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this request to
the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer the RRC
establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6 of this
specification.

> NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
> establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
> lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message for the
access attempt, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

> NOTE 2: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
> sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
> corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

> a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
> MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
> indication, an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, or an
> MO-IMS-registration-related-signalling-started indication, the NAS
> shall notify the upper layers that the access attempt is allowed;
>
> b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall
> initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5
> to send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message;
>
> c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the
> NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the
> PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;
>
> d\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to modify an existing PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate
> the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send
> the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message;
>
> e\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to
> re-establish the user-plane resources for an existing PDU session,
> 5GMM shall initiate the service request procedure as specified in
> subclause 5.6.1;
>
> f\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an uplink user
> data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane
> resources, 5GMM shall consider that the uplink user data packet is
> allowed to be sent;
>
> g\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to send a mobile originated location request, 5GMM shall
> initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in clause 5.4.5 to
> send an LCS message in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message; and
>
> h\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

> MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started

h\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated signalling transaction towards
the PCF by sending an UL NAS TRANSPORT message including a UE policy
container (see 3GPP TS 24.587 \[19B\]), 5GMM shall not initiate the NAS
transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the mobile
originated signalling transaction via an UL NAS TRANSPORT message. Upon
receiving an indication from the lower layers that the barring is
alleviated for the access category with which the access attempt was
associated, 5GMM may initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified
in subclause 5.4.5 to send the mobile originated signalling transaction
via an UL NAS TRANSPORT message, if still needed.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.2A) and the
determined access category by checking the rules specified in
table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the access attempt matches more than
one rule, the RRC establishment cause of the lowest rule number shall be
used. If the determined access category is an operator-defined access
category, then the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be
selected according to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or
more access identities (see subclauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.2A) and the
standardized access category determined for the operator-defined access
category as described in subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer. This procedure does not apply to IAB-MT.

After a PCell change in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE shall defer access barring
checks until it has obtained *SIB1* (as specified in 5.2.2.2) from the
target cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.2\]

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

> 1\> if timer T390 is running for the Access Category:
>
> 2\> consider the access attempt as barred;
>
> 1\> else if timer T302 is running and the Access Category is neither
> \'2\' nor \'0\':
>
> 2\> consider the access attempt as barred;
>
> 1\> else:
>
> 2\> if the Access Category is \'0\':
>
> 3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;
>
> 2\> else:
>
> 3\> if *SIB1* includes *uac-BarringPerPLMN-List* that contains a
> *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* for the selected PLMN or SNPN:
>
> 4\> if the procedure in 5.2.2.4.2 for a selected PLMN resulted in use
> of information in *npn-IdentityInfoList* and *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* has
> an entry with the *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to used
> information in this list:
>
> 5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the
> *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to used information in the
> *npn-IdentityInfoList*;
>
> 4\> else:
>
> 5\> select the *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry with the
> *plmn-IdentityIndex* corresponding to the selected PLMN and the
> *PLMN-IdentityInfo, if any,* or the selected SNPN and the
> *npn-IdentityInfoList*;
>
> 3\> if any *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry is selected:
>
> 4\> in the remainder of this procedure, use the selected
> *UAC-BarringPerPLMN* entry (i.e. presence or absence of access barring
> parameters in this entry) irrespective of the *uac-BarringForCommon*
> included in *SIB1*;
>
> 3\> else if SIB1 includes *uac-BarringForCommon*:
>
> 4\> in the remainder of this procedure use the *uac-BarringForCommon*
> (i.e. presence or absence of these parameters) included in *SIB1*;
>
> 3\> else:
>

### 11.3.11 UAC / Access Identity 1 / 0% access probability / release with redirect with *mpsPriorityIndication /* RRC\_INACTIVE

##### 11.3.11.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-31 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-64 .H6}

**with** { UE in NR RRC\_INACTIVE state }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE receives an RRCRelease message including
mpsPriorityIndication-r16 and the IE redirectedCarrierInfo with nr and
Access Identity 1 in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in the
\"UAC barring parameter\" is set to *zero in SIB1 of target cell* }

**then** { UE considers access attempt as allowed and resumes RRC
connection with establishmentCause set to mps-PriorityAccess }

}

##### 11.3.11.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-31 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 38.331, clauses 5.3.13.2, 5.3.14.5. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.13.2\]

The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers or AS (when responding
to RAN paging, upon triggering RNA updates while the UE is in
RRC\_INACTIVE, or for NR sidelink communication/V2X sidelink
communication as specified in clause 5.3.13.1a) requests the resume of a
suspended RRC connection.

...

Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

...

1\> else if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered by upper
layers:

2\> if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more
Access Identities:

3\> perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14
using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper
layers;

4\> if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;

2\> if the resumption occurs after release with redirect with
*mpsPriorityIndication*:

3\> set the resumeCause to mps-PriorityAccess;

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.5\]

The UE shall:

1\> if one or more Access Identities are indicated according to TS
24.501 \[23\], and

1\> if for at least one of these Access Identities the corresponding bit
in the *uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero*:

2\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

1\> else:

2\> if the establishment of the RRC connection is the result of release
with redirect with *mpsPriorityIndication* (either in NR or E-UTRAN)*;*
and

2\> if the bit corresponding to Access Identity 1 in the
*uac-BarringForAccessIdentity* contained in the \"UAC barring
parameter\" is set to *zero:*

3\> consider the access attempt as allowed;

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

1\> set the *ue-Identity* as follows:

2\> if upper layers provide a 5G-S-TMSI:

3\> set the *ue-Identity* to *ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part1*;

2\> else:

3\> draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..2^39^-1 and set the
*ue-Identity* to this value;

NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the *5G-S-TMSI* if the UE is registered in
the TA of the current cell.

1\> if the establishment of the RRC connection is the result of release
with redirect with *mpsPriorityIndication* (either in NR or E-UTRAN):

2\> set the *establishmentCause* to *mps-PriorityAccess*;

1\> else:

2\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

##### 11.3.12.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-32 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501: clause 4.5.2, 4.5.4.2, 4.5.2A and 4.5.6 and TS
38.331: clause 5.3.14.1, 5.3.14.2, 5.3.14.4 and 5.3.14.5. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

> a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
> table 4.5.2.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
> applicable in the selected PLMN, if a new PLMN is selected, or
> otherwise if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and
>
> b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
> identity 0 is applicable.

The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 1 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the
MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE
to determine if access identity 2 is valid. Processing of the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message is described in subclause 5.5.1.2.4 and
subclause 5.5.1.3.4. The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be
valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN prior to receiving
the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to \"Access identity 2 valid in
RPLMN or equivalent PLMN\".

When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM
files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] and
the rules specified in table 4.5.2.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 and access classes 11 - 15. When the
UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file EF~UAC\_AIC~ does
not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, and the USIM file
EF~UAC\_AIC~ indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2, the
MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not
applicable. When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, the contents
of the USIM files EF~UAC\_AIC~ and EF~ACC~ are not applicable.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.2A\]

\[Rel-16\]

When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events
listed in subclause 4.5.1, the UE shall determine one or more access
identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one
access category from the set of standardized access categories and
operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access
attempt.

The set of the access identities applicable for the request is
determined by the UE in the following way:

> a\) for each of the access identities 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 in
> table 4.5.2A.1, the UE shall check whether the access identity is
> applicable in the selected SNPN, if a new SNPN is selected, or
> otherwise if it is applicable in the RSNPN; and
>
> b\) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access
> identity 0 is applicable.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 1 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 1 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MPS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access identity 2 in the SNPN. When the contents of the
unified access control configuration in the \"list of subscriber data\"
stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) do not indicate the UE is
configured for access identity 2 for the SNPN, the UE uses the MCS
indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.

The contents of the unified access control configuration in the \"list
of subscriber data\" stored in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) and the
rules specified in table 4.5.2A.1 are used to determine the
applicability of access classes 11 to 15 in the SNPN.

In order to determine the access category applicable for the access
attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table 4.5.2A.2, and use the
access category for which there is a match for barring check. If the
access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the
lowest rule number shall be selected. If the access attempt matches more
than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall
select the access category from the operator-defined access category
definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause 4.5.3).

NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule
includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the
same time.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.4.2\]

\[Rel-15\]

When the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication, upon detecting one of events 1) through 6) listed
in subclause 4.5.1, the NAS shall categorize the corresponding access
attempt into access identities and an access category following
subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and subclause 4.5.2.3,
and provide the access identities and the access category to the lower
layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this request to
the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer the RRC
establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6 of this
specification.

NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message for the
access attempt, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 2: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

> a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
> MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
> indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, the NAS shall
> notify the upper layers that the access attempt is allowed;
>
> b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall
> initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5
> to send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message;
>
> c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the
> NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the
> PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;
>
> d\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to modify an existing PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate
> the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send
> the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message;
>
> e\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to
> re-establish the user-plane resources for an existing PDU session,
> 5GMM shall initiate the service request procedure as specified in
> subclause 5.6.1; and
>
> f\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an uplink user
> data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane
> resources, 5GMM shall consider that the uplink user data packet is
> allowed to be sent.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

> a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
> MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
> indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication:
>
> 1\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
> proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and
> ESM procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS
> available; see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];
>
> 2\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
> attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
> lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category
> with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the
> upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category;

NOTE 3: In this case prohibiting the initiation of the MMTEL voice
session, MMTEL video session or prohibiting sending of the SMS over IP
is performed by the upper layers.

> b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall not
> initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5
> to send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message. Upon receiving an
> indication from the lower layers that the barring is alleviated for
> the access category with which the access attempt was associated, 5GMM
> may initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in
> subclause 5.4.5 to send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message, if
> still needed;
>
> c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall not initiate
> the NAS transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
> REQUEST message. Upon receiving an indication from the lower layers
> that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the
> access attempt was associated, the NAS may initiate the NAS transport
> procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5, if still needed;
>
> d\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from

> shall not initiate the NAS transport procedure to send the PDU SESSION
> MODIFICATION REQUEST message. Upon receiving an indication from the

inactive indication, upon detecting one of events 1) through 8) listed
in subclause 4.5.1, the NAS shall categorize the corresponding access
attempt into access identities and an access category following:

> a\) subclause 4.5.2, table 4.5.2.1 and table 4.5.2.2, and
> subclause 4.5.2.3, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access mode; or
>
> b\) subclause 4.5.2A, table 4.5.2A.1 and table 4.5.2A.2, and
> subclause 4.5.3, if the UE is operating in SNPN access mode,

and provide the access identities and the access category to the lower
layers for the purpose of access control checking. In this request to
the lower layer the NAS can also provide to the lower layer the RRC
establishment cause determined as specified in subclause 4.5.6 of this
specification.

NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the NAS can provide the RRC
establishment cause to the lower layers after being informed by the
lower layers that the access attempt is allowed.

If the UE has uplink user data pending for one or more PDU sessions when
it builds a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message for the
access attempt, the UE shall indicate the respective PDU sessions in the
Uplink data status IE as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.6.1.2,
regardless of the access category for which the access barring check is
performed.

NOTE 2: The UE indicates pending user data for all the respective PDU
sessions, even if barring timers are running for some of the
corresponding access categories.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

> a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
> MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
> indication, an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, or an
> MO-IMS-registration-related-signalling-started indication, the NAS
> shall notify the upper layers that the access attempt is allowed;
>
> b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall
> initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5
> to send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message;
>
> c\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to establish a new PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate the
> NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the
> PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;
>
> d\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to modify an existing PDU session, 5GMM shall initiate
> the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send
> the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message;
>
> e\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request to
> re-establish the user-plane resources for an existing PDU session,
> 5GMM shall initiate the service request procedure as specified in
> subclause 5.6.1;
>
> f\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an uplink user
> data packet to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane
> resources, 5GMM shall consider that the uplink user data packet is
> allowed to be sent;
>
> g\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
> upper layers to send a mobile originated location request, 5GMM shall
> initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in clause 5.4.5 to
> send an LCS message in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message; and
>
> h\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from

> policy container (see 3GPP TS 24.587 \[19B\]), 5GMM shall initiate the
> NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to send the
> signalling transaction via an UL NAS TRANSPORT message.

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

> a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
> MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
> indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, or an
> MO-IMS-registration-related-signalling-started indication:
>
> 1\) if the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode, the UE may
> proceed in S1 mode with the appropriate EMM specific procedures and
> ESM procedures to make a PDN connection providing access to IMS
> available; see subclause 4.8.3 and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\];
>
> 2\) otherwise, the NAS shall notify the upper layers that the access
> attempt is barred. In this case, upon receiving an indication from the
> lower layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category
> with which the access attempt was associated, the NAS shall notify the
> upper layers that the barring is alleviated for the access category;

NOTE 3: In this case prohibiting the initiation of the MMTEL voice
session, MMTEL video session or prohibiting sending of the SMS over IP
or the IMS registration related signalling is performed by the upper
layers.

> b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.5.6\]

When 5GMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the
RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to
one or more access identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the determined
access category as specified in table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2. If the
determined access category is an operator-defined access category, then
the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according
to table 4.5.6.1 and table 4.5.6.2 based on one or more access
identities (see subclause 4.5.2) and the standardized access category
determined for the operator-defined access category as described in
subclause 4.5.3.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.14.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to perform access barring check for an
access attempt associated with a given Access Category and one or more
Access Identities upon request from upper layers according to TS 24.501
\[23\] or the RRC layer.

After a PCell change in RRC\_CONNECTED the UE shall defer access barring
checks until it has obtained *SIB1* (as specified in 5.2.2.2) from the
target cell.

### 11.4.1 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE / 5GMM-IDLE / Emergency call / Utilising emergency number stored on the USIM / New emergency PDU session / Network failing the authentication check (5G AKA)

##### 11.4.1.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-33 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-67 .H6}

**with** { UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and 5GMM-IDLE mode
}

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE is requested to make an outgoing call using an emergency
number stored on the USIM }

**then** { UE establishes an RRC connection with the RRC
*establishmentCause* set to \"emergency\", **and**, sends a SERVICE
REQUEST message with Service type IE set to \"emergency services\",
**and**, establishes a New emergency PDU session by sending an UL NAS
TRANSPORT *message with* Request type set to \"initial emergency
request\" *and a* PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST }

}

##### (2) {#section-68 .H6}

**with** { UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode having established an Emergency call }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE establishes that the network has failed the authentication
check during a 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure }

**then** { UE continues using the current security context, **and**,
releases all non-emergency PDU sessions by initiating UE-requested PDU
session release procedure and does not treat the active cell as barred
for non-emergency services }

}

##### 11.4.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-33 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331 \[12\], subclause 5.3.3.3, TS 24.501 \[22\],
subclauses 5.6.1.2, 6.4.1.2, 5.4.1.3.7, TS 22.101 \[42\], subclause
10.1.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.331, subclause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

\...

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.6.1.2\]

The UE initiates the service request procedure by sending a SERVICE
REQUEST message to the AMF and starts timer T3517.

If the UE is sending the SERVICE REQUEST message from 5GMM-IDLE mode and
the UE needs to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall send the SERVICE
REQUEST message including the NAS message container IE as described in
subclause 4.4.6.

\...

For case c) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the Uplink data status IE shall not be
included in the SERVICE REQUEST message except if the UE has one or more
active always-on PDU sessions associated with the access type over which
the SERVICE REQUEST message is sent. If the UE is not a UE configured
for high priority access in selected PLMN and:

a\) if the SERVICE REQUEST message is triggered by a request for
emergency services from the upper layer, the UE shall set the service
type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message to \"emergency services\"; or

\[TS 24.501, subclause 6.4.1.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

access, the \"voice centric\" UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state will receive a
request from upper layers to establish the PDU session for IMS
signalling, if the conditions for performing an initial registration
with IMS indicated in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\] subclause U.3.1.2 are
satisfied.

If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session, the UE shall allocate
a PDU session ID which is not currently being used by another PDU
session over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access.

The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the
PTI IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the allocated
PTI value.

\...

If the UE requests to establish a new emergency PDU session, the UE
shall set the SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message to \"SSC mode 1\".

\...

The UE shall transport:

a\) the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) the PDU session ID of the PDU session being established, or being
handed over or being transferred;

..

e\) the request type which is set to:

\...

3\) \"initial emergency request\", if the UE requests to establish a new
emergency PDU session; and

\...

If the request type is set to \"initial emergency request\" or
\"existing emergency PDU session\", neither DNN nor S-NSSAI is
transported by the UE using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5.

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

\...

b\) Any emergency call number stored on a SIM/USIM when the SIM/USIM is
present.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.4.1.3.7\]

g\) Network failing the authentication check.

If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check,
then it shall request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and
treat the active cell as barred (see 3GPP TS 38.304 \[28\]). The UE
shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521), if
they were running and stopped when the UE received the first
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an incorrect authentication
challenge data causing authentication failure.

\...

For items c, d, e, and f whether or not the UE is registered for
emergency services:

\...

The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check
or assume that the authentication is not genuine and proceed as
described in item g above if any of the following occurs:

\- the timer T3520 expires;

\...

For items c, d, e, and f:

\...

If a UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing an
emergency PDU session when timer T3520 expires, the UE shall not deem
that the network has failed the authentication check and not behave as
described in item g. Instead the UE shall continue using the current
security context, if any, release all non-emergency PDU sessions, if
any, by initiating UE-requested PDU session release procedure. If there
is an ongoing PDU session establishment procedure, the UE shall release
all non-emergency PDU sessions upon completion of the PDU session
establishment procedure. The UE shall start any retransmission timers
(e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521) if:

\- they were running and stopped when the UE received the AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message and detected an authentication failure;

\- the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been
completed.

The UE shall behave as if the UE is registered for emergency services.

##### 11.4.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-34 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331 \[12\], subclause 5.3.3.3, TS 23.501 \[37\],
subclause 5.16.4.1, TS 23.122 \[38\], subclauses 2, 3.1, 3.5,
TS 24.501 \[22\], subclauses 4.4.4.1, 5.1.3.2.1.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.4.2.3,
5.5.1.2.2, 5.5.1.2.4, 6.4.1.2, TS 22.101 \[42\], subclause 10.1.1.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 36.331, subclause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

\...

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

\[TS 23.501, subclause 5.16.4.1\]

UEs that are in limited service state, as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\],
or that camp normally on a cell but failed to register successfully to
the network under conditions specified in TS 24.501 \[47\], initiate the
Registration procedure by indicating that the registration is to receive
Emergency Services, referred to as Emergency Registration, and a
Follow-on request is included in the Registration Request to initiate
PDU Session Establishment procedure with a Request Type indicating
\"Emergency Request\". UEs that had registered for normal services and
do not have emergency PDU Sessions established and that are subject to
Mobility Restriction in the present area or RAT (e.g. because of
restricted tracking area) shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure to receive Emergency Services, i.e. with a
Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\". Based on local
regulation, the network supporting Emergency Services for UEs in limited
service state provides Emergency Services to these UE, regardless
whether the UE can be authenticated, has roaming or Mobility
Restrictions or a valid subscription.

\[TS 23.122, clause 2\]

If the MS is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on, or the SIM is
not inserted, or if it receives certain responses to an LR request
(e.g., \"illegal MS\"), it attempts to camp on a cell irrespective of
the PLMN identity, and enters a \"limited service\" state in which it
can only attempt to make emergency calls. An MS operating in NB-S1 mode,
never attempts to make emergency calls.

\[TS 23.122, subclause 3.1\]

An MS that is attaching for emergency bearer services or is attached for
emergency bearer services may access PLMNs in the list of \"forbidden
PLMNs\" or the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\". The MS
shall not remove any entry from the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or the
list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" as a result of such
accesses.

\[TS 23.122, subclause 3.5\]

There are a number of situations in which the MS is unable to obtain
normal service from a PLMN. These include:

a\) Failure to find a suitable cell of the selected PLMN;

\...

(In automatic PLMN selection mode, items a, c and f would normally cause
a new PLMN selection, but even in this case, the situation may arise
when no PLMNs are available and allowable for use).

For the items a to f, the MS attempts to camp on an acceptable cell,
irrespective of its PLMN identity, so that emergency calls can be made
if necessary, with the exception that an MS operating in NB-S1 mode,
shall never attempt to make emergency calls. When in the limited service
state with a valid SIM, the MS shall search for available and allowable
PLMNs in the manner described in subclause 4.4.3.1 and when indicated in
the SIM also as described in subclause 4.4.3.4. For an MS that is not in
eCall only mode, with the exception of performing GPRS attach or EPS
attach for emergency bearer services, or performing registration for
emergency services, no LR requests are made until a valid SIM is present
and either a suitable cell is found or a manual network reselection is
performed. For an MS in eCall only mode, no LR requests are made except
for performing EPS attach for emergency bearer services or registration
for emergency services. When performing GPRS attach or EPS attach for
emergency bearer services, or registration for emergency services, the
PLMN of the current serving cell is considered as the selected PLMN for
the duration the MS is attached for emergency bearer services or
registered for emergency services. In the limited service state the
presence of the MS need not be known to the PLMN on whose cell it has
camped.

There are also other conditions under which only emergency calls may be
made. These are shown in table 2 in clause 5. ProSe direct communication
and ProSe direct discovery for public safety use can be initiated if
necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.334 \[51\]) when in the limited service state
due to items a) or c) or f). V2X communication over PC5 can be initiated
if necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.386 \[59\]) when in the limited service
state due to items a) or c) or f).

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.4.4.1\]

The use of \"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-IA0 (see subclause
9.11.3.32) in the current 5G NAS security context is only allowed for an
unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency services is
allowed. For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages,
the UE and the AMF shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether
the \"null integrity protection algorithm\" or any other integrity
protection algorithm is indicated in the 5G NAS security context.

If the \"null integrity protection algorithm\"5G-IA0 has been selected
as an integrity protection algorithm, the receiver shall regard the NAS
messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as
integrity protected.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.1.3.2.1.3.3\]

The substate 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE is chosen in the UE, when
it is known that a selected cell for 3GPP access or TA for non-3GPP
access is unable to provide normal service (e.g. the selected cell over
3GPP access is in a forbidden PLMN or is in a forbidden tracking area or
TA for non-3GPP access is forbidden).

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.3.2\]

The UE provides the SUPI to the network in concealed form. The SUCI is a
privacy preserving identifier containing the concealed SUPI. When the
SUPI contains a network specific identifier, the SUCI shall take the
form of an NAI as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[4\].

A UE supporting N1 mode includes a SUCI:

a\) in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message when the UE is attempting
initial registration procedure and a valid 5G-GUTI is not available; or

\...

The UE shall use the \"null-scheme\" as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501
\[24\] to generate the SUCI, if the following applies:

a\) the UE performs a registration procedure for emergency services or
initiates a de-registration procedure before the registration procedure
for emergency services was completed successfully; and

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.4.2.3\]

If the UE is registered for emergency services, performing initial
registration for emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU
session and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received with ngKSI
value \"000\" and 5G-IA0 and 5G-EA0 as selected 5G NAS security
algorithms, the UE shall locally derive and take in use 5G NAS security
context. The UE shall delete existing current 5G NAS security context.

The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the
\"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-EA0 as the selected 5G NAS
integrity algorithm only if the message is received when the UE is
registered for emergency services, performing initial registration for
emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU session.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

\...

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

\...

If the UE initiates an initial registration for emergency services or
needs to prolong the established NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the initial registration procedure (e.g. due to uplink
signalling pending), the UE shall set the Follow-on request indicator to
1.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services, and
if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs\", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the
corresponding list(s).

\[TS 24.501, subclause 6.4.1.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

NOTE 0: When IMS voice is available over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access, the \"voice centric\" UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state will receive a
request from upper layers to establish the PDU session for IMS
signalling, if the conditions for performing an initial registration
with IMS indicated in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\] subclause U.3.1.2 are
satisfied.

If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session, the UE shall allocate
a PDU session ID which is not currently being used by another PDU
session over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access.

The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the
PTI IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the allocated
PTI value.

\...

If the UE requests to establish a new emergency PDU session, the UE
shall set the SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message to \"SSC mode 1\".

\...

The UE shall transport:

a\) the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) the PDU session ID of the PDU session being established, or being
handed over or being transferred;

..

e\) the request type which is set to:

\...

3\) \"initial emergency request\", if the UE requests to establish a new
emergency PDU session; and

\...

If the request type is set to \"initial emergency request\" or
\"existing emergency PDU session\", neither DNN nor S-NSSAI is
transported by the UE using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5.

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

##### 11.4.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-35 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331 \[12\], subclause 5.3.3.3, TS 23.501 \[37\],
subclause 5.16.4.1, TS 23.122 \[38\], subclauses 2, 3.5, TS 24.501
\[22\], subclauses 4.4.4.1, 5.1.3.2.1.3.6, 5.3.2, 5.4.2.3, 5.5.1.2.2,
6.4.1.2, TS 22.101 \[42\], subclause 10.1.1, TS 24.229 \[44\],
subclauses 5.1.6.1, 5.1.6.8.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements.

\[TS 36.331, subclause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

\...

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

\[TS 23.501, subclause 5.16.4.1\]

UEs that are in limited service state, as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\],
or that camp normally on a cell but failed to register successfully to
the network under conditions specified in TS 24.501 \[47\], initiate the
Registration procedure by indicating that the registration is to receive
Emergency Services, referred to as Emergency Registration, and a
Follow-on request is included in the Registration Request to initiate
PDU Session Establishment procedure with a Request Type indicating
\"Emergency Request\". UEs that had registered for normal services and
do not have emergency PDU Sessions established and that are subject to
Mobility Restriction in the present area or RAT (e.g. because of
restricted tracking area) shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure to receive Emergency Services, i.e. with a
Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\". Based on local
regulation, the network supporting Emergency Services for UEs in limited
service state provides Emergency Services to these UE, regardless
whether the UE can be authenticated, has roaming or Mobility
Restrictions or a valid subscription.

\[TS 23.122, clause 2\]

If the MS is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on, or the SIM is
not inserted, or if it receives certain responses to an LR request
(e.g., \"illegal MS\"), it attempts to camp on a cell irrespective of
the PLMN identity, and enters a \"limited service\" state in which it
can only attempt to make emergency calls. An MS operating in NB-S1 mode,
never attempts to make emergency calls.

\[TS 23.122, subclause 3.5\]

There are a number of situations in which the MS is unable to obtain
normal service from a PLMN. These include:

\...

b\) No SIM in the MS;

\...

For the items a to f, the MS attempts to camp on an acceptable cell,
irrespective of its PLMN identity, so that emergency calls can be made
if necessary, with the exception that an MS operating in NB-S1 mode,
shall never attempt to make emergency calls. When in the limited service
state with a valid SIM, the MS shall search for available and allowable
PLMNs in the manner described in subclause 4.4.3.1 and when indicated in
the SIM also as described in subclause 4.4.3.4. For an MS that is not in
eCall only mode, with the exception of performing GPRS attach or EPS
attach for emergency bearer services, or performing registration for
emergency services, no LR requests are made until a valid SIM is present
and either a suitable cell is found or a manual network reselection is
performed. For an MS in eCall only mode, no LR requests are made except
for performing EPS attach for emergency bearer services or registration
for emergency services. When performing GPRS attach or EPS attach for
emergency bearer services, or registration for emergency services, the
PLMN of the current serving cell is considered as the selected PLMN for
the duration the MS is attached for emergency bearer services or
registered for emergency services. In the limited service state the
presence of the MS need not be known to the PLMN on whose cell it has
camped.

There are also other conditions under which only emergency calls may be
made. These are shown in table 2 in clause 5. ProSe direct communication
and ProSe direct discovery for public safety use can be initiated if
necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.334 \[51\]) when in the limited service state
due to items a) or c) or f). V2X communication over PC5 can be initiated
if necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.386 \[59\]) when in the limited service
state due to items a) or c) or f).

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.4.4.1\]

The use of \"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-IA0 (see subclause
9.11.3.32) in the current 5G NAS security context is only allowed for an
unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency services is
allowed. For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages,
the UE and the AMF shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether
the \"null integrity protection algorithm\" or any other integrity
protection algorithm is indicated in the 5G NAS security context.

If the \"null integrity protection algorithm\"5G-IA0 has been selected
as an integrity protection algorithm, the receiver shall regard the NAS
messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as
integrity protected.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.1.3.2.1.3.6\]

The substate 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-SUPI is chosen in the UE, if the N1
mode is enabled and the UE has no valid subscriber data available
(SIM/USIM not available, the SIM/USIM is considered invalid by the UE).

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.3.2\]

A UE supporting NG-RAN includes a PEI:

a\) when neither SUPI nor valid 5G-GUTI is available to use for
emergency services in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GS
registration type IE set to \"emergency registration\"; and

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.4.2.3\]

If the UE is registered for emergency services, performing initial
registration for emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU
session and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received with ngKSI
value \"000\" and 5G-IA0 and 5G-EA0 as selected 5G NAS security
algorithms, the UE shall locally derive and take in use 5G NAS security
context. The UE shall delete existing current 5G NAS security context.

The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the
\"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-EA0 as the selected 5G NAS
integrity algorithm only if the message is received when the UE is
registered for emergency services, performing initial registration for
emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU session.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

\...

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

\...

If the UE initiates an initial registration for emergency services or
needs to prolong the established NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the initial registration procedure (e.g. due to uplink
signalling pending), the UE shall set the Follow-on request indicator to
1.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 6.4.1.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

NOTE 0: When IMS voice is available over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access, the \"voice centric\" UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state will receive a
request from upper layers to establish the PDU session for IMS
signalling, if the conditions for performing an initial registration
with IMS indicated in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\] subclause U.3.1.2 are
satisfied.

If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session, the UE shall allocate
a PDU session ID which is not currently being used by another PDU
session over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access.

The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the
PTI IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the allocated
PTI value.

\...

If the UE requests to establish a new emergency PDU session, the UE
shall set the SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message to \"SSC mode 1\".

\...

The UE shall transport:

a\) the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) the PDU session ID of the PDU session being established, or being
handed over or being transferred;

..

e\) the request type which is set to:

\...

3\) \"initial emergency request\", if the UE requests to establish a new
emergency PDU session; and

\...

If the request type is set to \"initial emergency request\" or
\"existing emergency PDU session\", neither DNN nor S-NSSAI is
transported by the UE using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5.

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

\[TS 24.229, clause 5.1.6.1\]:

If the IM CN subsystem is selected and the UE has no credentials the UE
can make an emergency call without being registered. The UE shall
attempt an emergency call as described in subclause 5.1.6.8.2.

\[TS 24.229, clause 5.1.6.8.2\]:

When establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the UE
is allowed to receive responses to emergency requests and requests
inside an established emergency session on the unprotected ports. The UE
shall reject or silently discard all other messages not arriving on a
protected port. Additionally, the UE shall transmit signalling packets
pertaining to the emergency session from the same IP address and
unprotected port on which it expects to receive signalling packets
containing the responses to emergency requests and the requests inside
the established emergency session.

Prior to establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the
UE shall acquire a local IP address, discover a P-CSCF, and establish an
IP-CAN bearer that can be used for SIP signalling. The UE shall send
only the initial INVITE requests to the port advertised to the UE during
the P-CSCF discovery procedure. If the UE does not receive any specific
port information during the P-CSCF discovery procedure, the UE shall
send the initial INVITE request to the SIP default port values as
specified in RFC 3261 \[26\].

The UE shall apply the procedures as specified in subclause 5.1.2A.1 and
subclause 5.1.3 with the following additions:

1\) the UE shall set the From header field of the INVITE request to
\"Anonymous\" as specified in RFC 3261 \[26\];

2\) the UE shall include a service URN in the Request-URI of the initial
INVITE request in accordance with subclause 5.1.6.8.1;

NOTE 1: Other specifications make provision for emergency service
identifiers, which are not specifically the emergency service URN, to be
recognised in the UE. Emergency service identifiers which the UE does
not detect will be treated as a normal call by the UE.

3\) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header field with
the same emergency service URN as in the Request-URI;

4\) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), the UE shall include in the
P-Access-Network-Info header field in any request for a dialog, any
subsequent request (except CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL
responses) within a dialog or any request. Insertion of the
P-Access-Network-Info header field into the ACK request is optional. The
UE shall populate the P-Access-Network-Info header field with the
current point of attachment to the IP-CAN as specified for the access
network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4). The P-Access-Network-Info
header field contains the location identifier such as the cell id, the
line id or the identity of the WLAN access node, which is relevant for
routeing the emergency call;

5\) if defined by the access technology specific annex, the UE shall
populate the P-Preferred-Identity header field in the INVITE request
with an equipment identifier as a SIP URI. The special details of the
equipment identifier to use depend on the IP-CAN;

6\) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI that contains in the
hostport parameter the IP address of the UE and an unprotected port
where the UE will receive incoming requests belonging to this dialog.
The UE shall also include a \"sip.instance\" media feature tag
containing Instance ID as described in RFC 5626 \[92\]. The UE shall not
include either the public or temporary GRUU in the Contact header field;

7\) a Via header field set to include the IP address of the UE in the
sent-by field and for the UDP the unprotected server port value where
the UE will receive response to the emergency request, while for the
TCP, the response is received on the TCP connection on which the
emergency request was sent. For the UDP, the UE shall also include
\"rport\" header field parameter with no value in the top Via header
field. Unless the UE has been configured to not send keep-alives, and
unless the UE is directly connected to an IP-CAN for which usage of NAT
is not defined, it shall include a \"keep\" header field parameter with
no value in the Via header field, in order to indicate support of
sending keep-alives associated with, and during the lifetime of, the
emergency session, as described in RFC 6223 \[143\];

NOTE 2: The UE inserts the same IP address and port number into the
Contact header field and the Via header field, and sends all IP packets
to the P-CSCF from this IP address and port number.

8\) if the UE has its location information available, or a URI that
points to the location information, the UE shall include a Geolocation
header field in the INVITE request in the following way:

\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location
is stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as
described in RFC 6442 \[89\]; or

\- if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with
RFC 4119 \[90\], include the location object in a message body with the
content type application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL,
referring to the message body, as the Geolocation header field value, as
described RFC 6442 \[89\], and include a Content-Disposition header
field with a disposition type \"render\" value and a \"handling\" header
field parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in
RFC 3261 \[26\];

9\) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also
include a Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field
value, which indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other
entities to make routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 \[89\];

10\) if the UE has neither geographical location information available,
nor a URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not
insert a Geolocation header field in the INVITE request; and

NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a
URI when the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF
provider. This is an issue on which the network operator needs to
provide guidance to the end user. A URI that is only resolvable to the
UE which is making the emergency call is inapplicable in this area.

11\) if support of the current location discovery during an emergency
call is allowed in the IP-CAN specific annex and the UE supports the
current location discovery during an emergency call, the UE shall
include a Recv-Info header field as described in RFC 6086 \[25\],
indicating the g.3gpp.current-location-discovery info package name and
shall include an Accept header field indicating the
\"application/vnd.3gpp.current-location-discovery+xml\" MIME type.

NOTE 4: During the dialog, the points of attachment to the IP-CAN of the
UE can change (e.g. UE connects to different cells). The UE will
populate the P-Access-Network-Info header field in any request or
response within a dialog with the current point of attachment to the
IP-CAN (e.g. the current cell information).

The UE shall build a proper preloaded Route header field value for all
new dialogs. The UE shall build a Route header field value containing
only the P-CSCF URI (containing the unprotected port number and the IP
address acquired at the time of the P-CSCF discovery procedures which
was used in registration of the contact address (or registration flow).

NOTE 5: If the UE is provisioned with or receives a FQDN at the time of
the P-CSCF discovery procedures, the FQDN is resolved to an IP address
at the time of the P-CSCF discovery procedures.

When a SIP transaction times out, i.e. timer B, timer F or timer H
expires at the UE, the UE may behave as if timer F expired, as described
in subclause 5.1.1.4.

NOTE 6: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means.

NOTE 7: A number of header fields can reveal information about the
identity of the user. Where privacy is required, implementers should
also give consideration to other header fields that can reveal identity
information. RFC 3323 \[33\] subclause 4.1 gives considerations relating
to a number of header fields.

NOTE 8: RFC 3261 \[26\] provides for the use of the Priority header
field with a suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that
emergency sessions contain this value, but such usage will have no
impact on the processing within the IM CN subsystem.

If the response for the initial INVITE request indicates that the UE is
behind NAT, and the INVITE request was sent over TCP connection, the UE
shall keep the TCP connection during the entire duration of the
emergency session. In this case the UE will receive all responses to the
emergency requests and the requests inside the established emergency
session over this TCP connection.

If the Via header field of any provisional response, or of the final 200
(OK) response, for the initial INVITE request contains a \"keep\" header
field parameter with a value, unless the UE detects that it is not
behind a NAT, the UE shall start to send keep-alives associated with the
session towards the P-CSCF, as described in RFC 6223 \[143\].

##### 11.4.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-36 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 5.5.1.3.5, 5.3.9, 5.5.1.3.2,
6.3.3.3, TS 22.101 \[42\], subclause 10.1.1. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.3.5\]

If the mobility and periodic registration update request cannot be
accepted by the network, the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT
message to the UE including an appropriate 5GMM cause value.

\...

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\...

\#22 (Congestion).

If the T3346 value IE is present in the REGISTRATION REJECT message and
the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the
UE shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be considered as
an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified
in subclause 5.5.1.3.7.

The UE shall abort the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update. If the rejected request was not for initiating an
emergency PDU session, the UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT
UPDATED and change to state
5GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION-UPDATE.

The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall
start timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.

\...

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update is started, if still necessary, when timer
T3346 expires or is stopped.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.3.9\]

If timer T3346 is running or is deactivated, and the UE is a UE
configured for high priority access in selected PLMN, or the UE needs to
initiate signalling for emergency services or emergency services
fallback, then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GMM procedures.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.3.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by sending a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF,

\...

k\) when the UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION-UPDATE
receives a request from the upper layers to establish an emergency PDU
session or perform emergency services fallback;

\[TS 24.501, subclause 6.3.3.3\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5,
the UE considers the PDU session as released and the UE shall create a
PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

\...

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#26
\"insufficient resources\" and the Back-off timer value IE, the UE shall
ignore the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE provided by the
network, if any, and the UE shall take different actions depending on
the timer value received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value:

\...

When the timer T3396 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

\...

The UE shall set the Follow-on request indicator to 1, if the UE:

a\) initiates the mobility and periodic registration updating procedure
upon request of the upper layers to establish an emergency PDU session;

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

b\) Any emergency call number stored on a SIM/USIM when the SIM/USIM is
present.

c\) 000, 08, 110, 999, 118 and 119 when a SIM/USIM is not present. These
numbers shall be stored on the ME.

d\) Additional emergency call numbers that may have been downloaded by
the serving network when the SIM/USIM is present.

**with** { UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state and 5GMM-IDLE
mode }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE is requested to make an Emergency call }

**with** { UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state and 5GMM-IDLE
mode having established an Emergency call }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE is requested to release the Emergency call }

**then** { UE releases the Emergency call, **and**, the UE considers the
current cell as belonging to 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming }

}

##### 11.4.5.2 Conformance requirement {#conformance-requirement .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 5.5.1.3.5, TS 23.122 \[38\],
subclause 3.4.2, TS 24.229 \[44\] subclauses U.2.2.6.1, 5.1.6.8.2.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.3.5\]

\#15 (No suitable cells in tracking area).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2). The UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter and shall enter the state
5GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. The UE shall search for a suitable cell
in another tracking area according to 3GPP TS 38.304 \[28\].

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\" and shall remove the current TAI from the
stored TAI list, if present.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status and tracking area
updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the
case when the normal tracking area updating procedure is rejected with
the EMM cause with the same value.

\[TS 23.122, subclause 3.4.2\]

The MS is not allowed to request 5GS services except emergency services
when camped on a cell of a TA of which belongs to the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\".

\[TS 24.229, clause U.2.2.6.1\]:

Some jurisdictions allow emergency calls to be made when the UE does not
contain an UICC, or where the credentials are not accepted.
Additionally, where the UE is in state 5GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE
or 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, a normal registration in 5GS has been
attempted but it can also be assumed that a registration in the IM CN
subsystem will also fail. In such cases, subject to the lower layers
indicating that the network does support emergency bearer services in
limited service state (see 3GPP TS 36.331 \[19F\] or
3GPP TS 38.331 \[19G\]), the procedures for emergency calls without
registration can be applied, as defined in subclause 5.1.6.8.2. If the
5GS primary authentication procedure has already succeeded during the
latest normal or emergency registration procedure in 5GS, the UE shall
perform an initial emergency registration, as described in
subclause 5.1.6.2 before attempting an emergency call as described in
subclause 5.1.6.8.3.

NOTE 1: The UE can determine that 5GS primary authentication procedure
has succeeded during the emergency registration procedure in 5GS when a
non-null integrity protection algorithm (i.e. other than 5G-IA0
algorithm) is received in the NAS signalling SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message.

To perform emergency registration, the UE shall request to establish an
emergency PDU session as described in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[258\]. The
procedures for PDU session establishment and P-CSCF discovery, as
described in subclause U.2.2.1 of this specification apply accordingly.

\[TS 24.229, clause 5.1.6.8.2\]:

When establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the UE
is allowed to receive responses to emergency requests and requests
inside an established emergency session on the unprotected ports. The UE
shall reject or silently discard all other messages not arriving on a
protected port. Additionally, the UE shall transmit signalling packets
pertaining to the emergency session from the same IP address and
unprotected port on which it expects to receive signalling packets
containing the responses to emergency requests and the requests inside
the established emergency session.

Prior to establishing an emergency session for an unregistered user, the
UE shall acquire a local IP address, discover a P-CSCF, and establish an
IP-CAN bearer that can be used for SIP signalling. The UE shall send
only the initial INVITE requests to the port advertised to the UE during
the P-CSCF discovery procedure. If the UE does not receive any specific
port information during the P-CSCF discovery procedure, the UE shall
send the initial INVITE request to the SIP default port values as
specified in RFC 3261 \[26\].

The UE shall apply the procedures as specified in subclause 5.1.2A.1 and
subclause 5.1.3 with the following additions:

1\) the UE shall set the From header field of the INVITE request to
\"Anonymous\" as specified in RFC 3261 \[26\];

2\) the UE shall include a service URN in the Request-URI of the initial
INVITE request in accordance with subclause 5.1.6.8.1;

NOTE 1: Other specifications make provision for emergency service
identifiers, which are not specifically the emergency service URN, to be
recognised in the UE. Emergency service identifiers which the UE does
not detect will be treated as a normal call by the UE.

3\) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header field with
the same emergency service URN as in the Request-URI;

4\) if available to the UE (as defined in the access technology specific
annexes for each access technology), the UE shall include in the
P-Access-Network-Info header field in any request for a dialog, any
subsequent request (except CANCEL requests) or response (except CANCEL
responses) within a dialog or any request. Insertion of the
P-Access-Network-Info header field into the ACK request is optional. The
UE shall populate the P-Access-Network-Info header field with the
current point of attachment to the IP-CAN as specified for the access
network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4). The P-Access-Network-Info
header field contains the location identifier such as the cell id, the
line id or the identity of the WLAN access node, which is relevant for
routeing the emergency call;

5\) if defined by the access technology specific annex, the UE shall
populate the P-Preferred-Identity header field in the INVITE request
with an equipment identifier as a SIP URI. The special details of the
equipment identifier to use depend on the IP-CAN;

6\) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI that contains in the
hostport parameter the IP address of the UE and an unprotected port
where the UE will receive incoming requests belonging to this dialog.
The UE shall also include a \"sip.instance\" media feature tag
containing Instance ID as described in RFC 5626 \[92\]. The UE shall not
include either the public or temporary GRUU in the Contact header field;

7\) a Via header field set to include the IP address of the UE in the
sent-by field and for the UDP the unprotected server port value where
the UE will receive response to the emergency request, while for the
TCP, the response is received on the TCP connection on which the
emergency request was sent. For the UDP, the UE shall also include
\"rport\" header field parameter with no value in the top Via header
field. Unless the UE has been configured to not send keep-alives, and
unless the UE is directly connected to an IP-CAN for which usage of NAT
is not defined, it shall include a \"keep\" header field parameter with
no value in the Via header field, in order to indicate support of
sending keep-alives associated with, and during the lifetime of, the
emergency session, as described in RFC 6223 \[143\];

NOTE 2: The UE inserts the same IP address and port number into the
Contact header field and the Via header field, and sends all IP packets
to the P-CSCF from this IP address and port number.

8\) if the UE has its location information available, or a URI that
points to the location information, the UE shall include a Geolocation
header field in the INVITE request in the following way:

\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location
is stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as
described in RFC 6442 \[89\]; or

\- if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with
RFC 4119 \[90\], include the location object in a message body with the
content type application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL,
referring to the message body, as the Geolocation header field value, as
described RFC 6442 \[89\], and include a Content-Disposition header
field with a disposition type \"render\" value and a \"handling\" header
field parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in
RFC 3261 \[26\];

9\) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also
include a Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field
value, which indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other
entities to make routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 \[89\];

10\) if the UE has neither geographical location information available,
nor a URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not
insert a Geolocation header field in the INVITE request; and

NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a
URI when the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF
provider. This is an issue on which the network operator needs to
provide guidance to the end user. A URI that is only resolvable to the
UE which is making the emergency call is inapplicable in this area.

11\) if support of the current location discovery during an emergency
call is allowed in the IP-CAN specific annex and the UE supports the
current location discovery during an emergency call, the UE shall
include a Recv-Info header field as described in RFC 6086 \[25\],
indicating the g.3gpp.current-location-discovery info package name and
shall include an Accept header field indicating the
\"application/vnd.3gpp.current-location-discovery+xml\" MIME type.

NOTE 4: During the dialog, the points of attachment to the IP-CAN of the
UE can change (e.g. UE connects to different cells). The UE will
populate the P-Access-Network-Info header field in any request or
response within a dialog with the current point of attachment to the
IP-CAN (e.g. the current cell information).

The UE shall build a proper preloaded Route header field value for all
new dialogs. The UE shall build a Route header field value containing
only the P-CSCF URI (containing the unprotected port number and the IP
address acquired at the time of the P-CSCF discovery procedures which
was used in registration of the contact address (or registration flow).

NOTE 5: If the UE is provisioned with or receives a FQDN at the time of
the P-CSCF discovery procedures, the FQDN is resolved to an IP address
at the time of the P-CSCF discovery procedures.

When a SIP transaction times out, i.e. timer B, timer F or timer H
expires at the UE, the UE may behave as if timer F expired, as described
in subclause 5.1.1.4.

NOTE 6: It is an implementation option whether these actions are also
triggered by other means.

NOTE 7: A number of header fields can reveal information about the
identity of the user. Where privacy is required, implementers should
also give consideration to other header fields that can reveal identity
information. RFC 3323 \[33\] subclause 4.1 gives considerations relating
to a number of header fields.

NOTE 8: RFC 3261 \[26\] provides for the use of the Priority header
field with a suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that
emergency sessions contain this value, but such usage will have no
impact on the processing within the IM CN subsystem.

If the response for the initial INVITE request indicates that the UE is
behind NAT, and the INVITE request was sent over TCP connection, the UE
shall keep the TCP connection during the entire duration of the
emergency session. In this case the UE will receive all responses to the
emergency requests and the requests inside the established emergency
session over this TCP connection.

If the Via header field of any provisional response, or of the final 200
(OK) response, for the initial INVITE request contains a \"keep\" header
field parameter with a value, unless the UE detects that it is not
behind a NAT, the UE shall start to send keep-alives associated with the
session towards the P-CSCF, as described in RFC 6223 \[143\].

##### 11.4.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-37 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 5.3.5, TS 22.101 \[42\],
subclause 10.1.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.3.5\]

When the UE receives a Service area list IE with a non-allowed area
indication during a registration procedure or a generic UE configuration
update procedure, the UE shall delete the old list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\" and store the tracking areas in the non-allowed area as
the list of \"non-allowed tracking areas\". If the UE has a stored list
of \"allowed tracking areas\", the UE shall delete that list.

\...

If the UE is successfully registered to a PLMN and has a stored list of
\"non-allowed tracking areas\":

\...

b\) while camped on a cell whose TAI is in the list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\", the UE shall enter the state
5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE, and:

1\) if the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, the UE:

\...

ii\) shall not initiate a service request procedure except for emergency
services, high priority access, responding to paging or notification or
indicating a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status; and

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

b\) Any emergency call number stored on a SIM/USIM when the SIM/USIM is
present.

c\) 000, 08, 110, 999, 118 and 119 when a SIM/USIM is not present. These
numbers shall be stored on the ME.

d\) Additional emergency call numbers that may have been downloaded by
the serving network when the SIM/USIM is present.

##### 11.4.7.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-38 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331 \[12\], subclause 5.3.3.3, TS 24.501 \[22\],
subclause 5.3.12, TS 24.301 \[21\], subclause 5.3.7, TS 22.101 \[42\],
subclause 10.1.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.331, subclause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

\...

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.3.12\]

The network may send a Local emergency numbers list or an Extended local
emergency numbers list or both, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, by
including the Emergency number list IE and the Extended emergency number
list IE, respectively. The Local emergency numbers list can be updated
as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\], subclause 5.3.7.

The user equipment shall store the Local emergency numbers list and the
Extended local emergency numbers list, as provided by the network. The
Local emergency numbers list stored in the user equipment shall be
replaced on each receipt of the Emergency number list IE. The Extended
local emergency numbers list stored in the user equipment shall be
replaced on each receipt of the Extended emergency number list IE. The
received Local emergency numbers list or the received Extended local
emergency numbers list or both shall be provided to the upper layers.

\...

The emergency number(s) received in the Emergency number list IE are
valid only in networks in the same country as the PLMN from which this
IE is received. If no Emergency number list IE is contained in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, then the stored Local emergency numbers
list in the user equipment shall be kept, except if the user equipment
has successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that
of the PLMN that sent the list.

The emergency number(s) received in the Extended emergency number list
IE are valid only in:

\- networks in the same country as the PLMN from which this IE is
received, if the Extended Emergency Number List Validity (EENLV) field
within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended local
Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which
this IE is received\"; and

\- the PLMN from which this IE is received, if the EENLV field within
the Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended local
Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is
received\".

If no Extended local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, and the registered PLMN has not changed,
then the stored Extended local Emergency Numbers List in the user
equipment shall be kept. If no Extended local Emergency Numbers List is
contained in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, but the registered PLMN
has changed, then:

\- if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the
Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended local Emergency
Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received\",
the stored Extended local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment
shall be deleted; and

\- if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the
Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended local Emergency
Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is
received\" the list shall be kept except if the user equipment has
successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of
the PLMN that sent the stored list.

NOTE: To prevent the misrouting of emergency calls, all operators within
a country need to follow the regulation or agree on the setting of the
Extended emergency number list IE in accordance to national agreement --
either to indicate validity within a country or to indicate validity
only within the PLMN.

The Local emergency numbers list and the Extended local emergency
numbers list shall be deleted at switch off or removal of the USIM. The
user equipment shall be able to store up to ten entries in the Local
emergency numbers list and up to twenty entries in the Extended local
emergency numbers list, received from the network.

For the use of the Local emergency numbers list and the Extended local
emergency numbers list by the UE see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\],
subclause 5.3.7.

\[TS 24.301, subclause 5.3.7\]

The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended local Emergency
Numbers list contain additional Local emergency numbers used by the
serving network. These lists can be downloaded by the network to the UE
at successful registration and subsequent registration updates. There is
only one Local Emergency Numbers List and only one Extended local
Emergency Numbers list in the UE. The Local Emergency Numbers List can
be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode, with GMM and MM
procedures if the UE is in A/Gb or Iu mode, and with 5GMM procedures, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], if UE is in N1 mode. The Extended
local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the
UE is in S1 mode and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], if UE is in N1 mode.

The UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List and the stored
Extended local Emergency Numbers List received from the network in
addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM or user equipment
to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.

If the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number, the
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[45\] and 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13D\]
are utilised to select a domain for the emergency session attempt.

If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the PS
domain, then the UE shall perform the session establishment procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13D\] to initiate an emergency session.

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

b\) Any emergency call number stored on a SIM/USIM when the SIM/USIM is
present.

c\) 000, 08, 110, 999, 118 and 119 when a SIM/USIM is not present. These
numbers shall be stored on the ME.

d\) Additional emergency call numbers that may have been downloaded by
the serving network when the SIM/USIM is present.

##### 11.4.8.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-39 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331 \[12\], subclause 5.3.3.3, TS 24.501 \[22\],
subclause 5.3.12, TS 24.301 \[21\], subclause 5.3.7, TS 22.101 \[42\],
subclause 10.1.1. The following represents a copy/paste extraction of
the requirements relevant to the test purpose; any references within the
copy/paste text should be understood within the scope of the core spec
they have been copied from. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements.

\[TS 38.331 \[12\], subclause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

\...

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

\[TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 5.3.12\]

The network may send a Local emergency numbers list or an Extended local
emergency numbers list or both, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, by
including the Emergency number list IE and the Extended emergency number
list IE, respectively. The Local emergency numbers list can be updated
as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\], subclause 5.3.7.

The user equipment shall store the Local emergency numbers list and the
Extended local emergency numbers list, as provided by the network. The
Local emergency numbers list stored in the user equipment shall be
replaced on each receipt of the Emergency number list IE. The Extended
local emergency numbers list stored in the user equipment shall be
replaced on each receipt of the Extended emergency number list IE. The
received Local emergency numbers list or the received Extended local
emergency numbers list or both shall be provided to the upper layers.

\...

The Local emergency numbers list and the Extended local emergency
numbers list shall be deleted at switch off or removal of the USIM. The
user equipment shall be able to store up to ten entries in the Local
emergency numbers list and up to twenty entries in the Extended local
emergency numbers list, received from the network.

For the use of the Local emergency numbers list and the Extended local
emergency numbers list by the UE see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\],
subclause 5.3.7.

\[TS 24.301 \[21\], subclause 5.3.7\]

The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended local Emergency
Numbers list contain additional Local emergency numbers used by the
serving network. These lists can be downloaded by the network to the UE
at successful registration and subsequent registration updates. There is
only one Local Emergency Numbers List and only one Extended local
Emergency Numbers list in the UE. The Local Emergency Numbers List can
be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode, with GMM and MM
procedures if the UE is in A/Gb or Iu mode, and with 5GMM procedures, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], if UE is in N1 mode. The Extended
local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the
UE is in S1 mode and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], if UE is in N1 mode.

The UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List and the stored
Extended local Emergency Numbers List received from the network in
addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM or user equipment
to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.

If the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number, the
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[45\] and 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13D\]
are utilised to select a domain for the emergency session attempt.

If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the PS
domain, then the UE shall perform the session establishment procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13D\] to initiate an emergency session.

\[TS 22.101 \[42\], subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

b\) Any emergency call number stored on a SIM/USIM when the SIM/USIM is
present.

c\) 000, 08, 110, 999, 118 and 119 when a SIM/USIM is not present. These
numbers shall be stored on the ME.

d\) Additional emergency call numbers that may have been downloaded by
the serving network when the SIM/USIM is present.

##### 11.4.9.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-40 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331 \[12\], subclause 5.3.3.3, TS 23.501 \[37\],
subclause 5.16.4.1, TS 23.122 \[38\], subclause 3.4.2, TS 24.501 \[22\],
subclauses 5.5.1.2.5, 4.4.4.1, 5.1.3.2.1.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.4.2.3, 5.5.1.2.2,
6.4.1.2, TS 22.101 \[42\], subclause 10.1.1. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

\...

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\...

\#15 (No suitable cells in tracking area).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2). The UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter and shall enter the state
5GMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. The UE shall search for a suitable cell
in another tracking area according to 3GPP TS 38.304 \[28\].

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\" and shall remove the current TAI from the
stored TAI list, if present.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status and tracking area
updating attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the
case when the normal tracking area updating procedure is rejected with
the EMM cause with the same value.

\[TS 23.122, subclause 3.4.2\]

The MS is not allowed to request 5GS services except emergency services
when camped on a cell of a TA of which belongs to the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\".

\[TS 36.331, subclause 5.3.3.3\]

The UE shall set the contents of *RRCSetupRequest* message as follows:

\...

1\> set the *establishmentCause* in accordance with the information
received from upper layers;

The UE shall submit the *RRCSetupRequest* message to lower layers for
transmission.

\[TS 23.501, subclause 5.16.4.1\]

UEs that are in limited service state, as specified in TS 23.122 \[17\],
or that camp normally on a cell but failed to register successfully to
the network under conditions specified in TS 24.501 \[47\], initiate the
Registration procedure by indicating that the registration is to receive
Emergency Services, referred to as Emergency Registration, and a
Follow-on request is included in the Registration Request to initiate
PDU Session Establishment procedure with a Request Type indicating
\"Emergency Request\". UEs that had registered for normal services and
do not have emergency PDU Sessions established and that are subject to
Mobility Restriction in the present area or RAT (e.g. because of
restricted tracking area) shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure to receive Emergency Services, i.e. with a
Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\". Based on local
regulation, the network supporting Emergency Services for UEs in limited
service state provides Emergency Services to these UE, regardless
whether the UE can be authenticated, has roaming or Mobility
Restrictions or a valid subscription.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.4.4.1\]

The use of \"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-IA0 (see subclause
9.11.3.32) in the current 5G NAS security context is only allowed for an
unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency services is
allowed. For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages,
the UE and the AMF shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether
the \"null integrity protection algorithm\" or any other integrity
protection algorithm is indicated in the 5G NAS security context.

If the \"null integrity protection algorithm\"5G-IA0 has been selected
as an integrity protection algorithm, the receiver shall regard the NAS
messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as
integrity protected.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.1.3.2.1.3.3\]

The substate 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE is chosen in the UE, when
it is known that a selected cell for 3GPP access or TA for non-3GPP
access is unable to provide normal service (e.g. the selected cell over
3GPP access is in a forbidden PLMN or is in a forbidden tracking area or
TA for non-3GPP access is forbidden).

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.3.2\]

The UE provides the SUPI to the network in concealed form. The SUCI is a
privacy preserving identifier containing the concealed SUPI. When the
SUPI contains a network specific identifier, the SUCI shall take the
form of an NAI as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[4\].

A UE supporting N1 mode includes a SUCI:

a\) in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message when the UE is attempting
initial registration procedure and a valid 5G-GUTI is not available; or

\...

The UE shall use the \"null-scheme\" as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501
\[24\] to generate the SUCI, if the following applies:

a\) the UE performs a registration procedure for emergency services or
initiates a de-registration procedure before the registration procedure
for emergency services was completed successfully; and

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.4.2.3\]

If the UE is registered for emergency services, performing initial
registration for emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU
session and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received with ngKSI
value \"000\" and 5G-IA0 and 5G-EA0 as selected 5G NAS security
algorithms, the UE shall locally derive and take in use 5G NAS security
context. The UE shall delete existing current 5G NAS security context.

The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the
\"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-EA0 as the selected 5G NAS
integrity algorithm only if the message is received when the UE is
registered for emergency services, performing initial registration for
emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU session.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

\...

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

\...

If the UE initiates an initial registration for emergency services or
needs to prolong the established NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the initial registration procedure (e.g. due to uplink
signalling pending), the UE shall set the Follow-on request indicator to
1.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 6.4.1.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

NOTE 0: When IMS voice is available over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access, the \"voice centric\" UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state will receive a
request from upper layers to establish the PDU session for IMS
signalling, if the conditions for performing an initial registration
with IMS indicated in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\] subclause U.3.1.2 are
satisfied.

If the UE requests to establish a new PDU session, the UE shall allocate
a PDU session ID which is not currently being used by another PDU
session over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access.

The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the
PTI IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the allocated
PTI value.

\...

If the UE requests to establish a new emergency PDU session, the UE
shall set the SSC mode IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message to \"SSC mode 1\".

\...

The UE shall transport:

a\) the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message;

b\) the PDU session ID of the PDU session being established, or being
handed over or being transferred;

..

e\) the request type which is set to:

\...

3\) \"initial emergency request\", if the UE requests to establish a new
emergency PDU session; and

\...

If the request type is set to \"initial emergency request\" or
\"existing emergency PDU session\", neither DNN nor S-NSSAI is
transported by the UE using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5.

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

##### 11.4.10a.2 Conformance requirements {#a.2-conformance-requirements-6 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 6.1.4.2, TS 22.101 \[42\],
subclause 10.1.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 6.1.4.2\]

When the network does not support N26 interface, the SMF does not
provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer context for a PDU session.

NOTE 1: Since the SMF does not provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer
context for a PDU session, the UE does not know whether interworking
with EPS is supported for a PDU session before attempting to transfer
the PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode.

NOTE 2: It is up to UE implementation to decide which PDU session(s) to
be attempted to transfer from N1 mode to S1 mode, e.g. based on UE
policy or UE local configuration.

\...

Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, the
UE shall use the parameters from each PDU session which the UE intends
to transfer to EPS to create the contents of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message as follows:

a\) if the PDU session is an emergency PDU session, the request type
shall be set to \"handover of emergency bearer services\". Otherwise the
request type shall be set to \"handover\";

b\) the PDU session type of the PDU session shall be mapped to the PDN
type of the default EPS bearer context as follows:

1\) the PDN type shall be set to \"non-IP\" if the PDU session type is
\"Ethernet\" or \"Unstructured\";

2\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4\";

3\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv6\"; and

4\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4v6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4v6\";

c\) the DNN of the PDU session shall be mapped to the APN of the default
EPS bearer context; and

d\) the PDU session ID parameter in the PCO IE shall be set to the PDU
session identity of the PDU session.

\...

After inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall
associate the PDU session identity with the default EPS bearer context.

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

### 11.4.11 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE / N26 interface not supported / S1 mode to N1 mode transfer of an existing emergency PDN connection

##### 11.4.11.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-42 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-98 .H6}

**with** { UE in EMM-REGISTERED and EMM-IDLE on an E-UTRA cell, **and**,
the UE has an emergency PDN connection established }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE performs a inter-system change from the S1 to N1 mode, to
an NR Cell belonging to a NWK supporting Interworking without N26
interface }

**then** { UE correctly transfers the existing emergency PDN connection
into an emergency PDU session }

}

##### 11.4.11.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-41 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 6.1.4.2, TS 22.101 \[42\],
subclause 10.1.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 6.1.4.2\]

When the network does not support N26 interface, the SMF does not
provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer context for a PDU session.

NOTE 1: Since the SMF does not provide the UE with the mapped EPS bearer
context for a PDU session, the UE does not know whether interworking
with EPS is supported for a PDU session before attempting to transfer
the PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode.

NOTE 2: It is up to UE implementation to decide which PDU session(s) to
be attempted to transfer from N1 mode to S1 mode, e.g. based on UE
policy or UE local configuration.

\...

Upon inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the
UE uses the parameters from the default EPS bearer context of each PDN
connection which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS and for which the UE
has allocated a PDU session identity to create a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message as follows:

a\) if the PDN connection is for emergency bearer services, the request
type shall be set to \"existing emergency PDU session\". Otherwise the
request type shall be set to \"existing PDU session\";

b\) the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to
the PDU session type of the PDU session as follows:

\...

2\) if the PDN type is \"IPv4\" the PDU session type is set to \"IPv4\";

3\) if the PDN type is \"IPv6\", the PDU session type is set to
\"IPv6\"; and

4\) the PDN type shall be set to \"IPv4v6\" if the PDU session type is
\"IPv4v6\";

c\) the APN of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to the DNN
of the PDU session;

d\) the PDU session ID shall be set to the PDU session identity included
by the UE in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol
configuration options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, or to
the PDU session ID associated with the default EPS bearer context; and

e\) the S-NSSAI of the PDU session shall be set to the S-NSSAI included
by the network in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended
protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
REQUEST message, if provided by the network, or the S-NSSAI associated
with the default EPS bearer context, if available.

NOTE 5: If T3584 is running or deactivated for the S-NSSAI and
optionally the DNN combination, the UE is allowed to initiate ESM
procedures in EPS with or without APN corresponding to that DNN, and if
the APN is congested in EPS, the MME can send a back-off timer for the
APN to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\].

The UE shall locally release the PDN connection(s) and EPS bearer(s)
associated with the 3GPP access which have not been transferred to 5GS.

\[TS 22.101, subclause 10.1.1\]

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

##### 11.4.12.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-42 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], clauses 4.9.2, 5.6.1.4; TS 24.301
\[21\], subclauses 4.4.2.3, 5.5.3.2.2 and TS 24.229 \[44\] clause
U.2.2.6.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

NOTE: Conformance requirements in regard to establishing an emergency
call in EPS are not provided. This can be found in IMS Emergency tests
specified in TS 36.523-1 \[13\].

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.9.2\]

The UE shall only disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access when in
5GMM-IDLE mode.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.6.1.4\]

For case h) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the indication from
the lower layers when the UE has changed to S1 mode or E-UTRA connected
to 5GCN (see 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\]) as successful completion of the
procedure and stop timer T3517.

\[TS 24.301, subclause 4.4.2.3\]

Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is
usually established by the MME during the attach procedure by initiating
a security mode control procedure. After successful completion of the
security mode control procedure, all NAS messages exchanged between the
UE and the MME are sent integrity protected using the current EPS
security algorithms, and except for the messages specified in
subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent ciphered using the current EPS security algorithms.

\...

During inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, if
the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and:

1\) if the tracking area updating procedure is initiated as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], the UE shall transmit a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message integrity protected with the current 5G NAS security
context and the UE shall derive a mapped EPS security context (see
subclause 8.6.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 \[56\]). The UE shall include the eKSI
indicating the 5G NAS security context value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.

After receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including the
eKSI, the MME forwards the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the
source AMF, if possible, to obtain the mapped EPS security context from
the AMF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[56\]. The MME re-establishes
the secure exchange of NAS messages by either:

\- replying with a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that is integrity
protected and ciphered using the mapped EPS NAS security context. From
this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in
subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent ciphered; or

\[TS 24.301, subclause 5.5.3.2.2\]

The UE in state EMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the tracking area updating
procedure by sending a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the MME,

\...

z\) when the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in
EMM-IDLE mode, the UE operates in single-registration mode, and
conditions specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\] apply;

\...

zd) when the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in
EMM-CONNECTED mode.

For all cases except case b, the UE shall set the EPS update type IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to \"TA updating\". For case b,
the UE shall set the EPS update type IE to \"periodic updating\".

\...

When initiating a tracking area updating procedure while in S1 mode, the
UE shall use the current EPS NAS integrity key to integrity protect the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, unless the UE is performing
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode.

\...

If a UE has established PDN connection(s) and uplink user data pending
to be sent via user plane when it initiates the tracking area updating
procedure, or uplink signalling not related to the tracking area
updating procedure when the UE does not support control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, it may also set an \"active\" flag in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message to indicate the request to establish the user
plane to the network and to keep the NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

\...

If the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall include the
eKSI (either KSI~ASME~ or KSI~SGSN~) in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. Otherwise, the UE shall set
the NAS Key Set Identifier IE to the value \"no key is available\". If
the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall integrity
protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the current EPS
security context. Otherwise the UE shall not integrity protect the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

\...

For the case z and zd, the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall be
integrity protected using the 5GS security context available in the UE.
The UE shall include a GUTI, mapped from 5G-GUTI (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[54\] and 3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\]), in the Old GUTI IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. In addition, the UE shall
include Old GUTI type IE with GUTI set to \"Native GUTI\", and the UE
shall include a UE status IE with a 5GMM registration status set to \"UE
is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state\".

When the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode,
the UE may also include an EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, indicating which EPS bearer contexts are
active in the UE. The UE shall include the EPS bearer context status IE
in TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message:

\- \...

\- for the case z; and

\...

If the UE initiates the first tracking area updating procedure following
an initial registration in N1 mode and the UE is operating in the
single-registration mode, the UE shall include a UE radio capability
information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

\...

If the UE supports NB-S1 mode, Non-IP PDN type, or N1 mode, then the UE
shall support the extended protocol configuration options IE.

For all cases except case b, if the UE supports the extended protocol
configuration options IE, then the UE shall set the ePCO bit to
\"extended protocol configuration options supported\" in the UE network
capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

\...

For all cases except case b, if the UE supports dual connectivity with
NR, then the UE shall set the DCNR bit to \"dual connectivity with NR
supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and shall include the UE additional security capability
IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

\...

For all cases except case b, if the UE supports N1 mode, the UE shall
set the N1mode bit to \"N1 mode supported\" in the UE network capability
IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and shall include the UE
additional security capability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

\[TS 24.229, subclause U.2.2.6.4\]

NOTE: This subclause covers only the case where the UE selects the IM CN
subsystem in accordance with the conventions and rules specified in
3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\] and describes the IP-CAN specific procedure. It
does not preclude the use of CS domain. When a CS system based on
3GPP TS 24.008 \[8\] is to be used, clause B.5 applies.

When the UE operates in single-registration mode as described in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[258\] and the UE recognises that a call request is an
emergency call, if:

1\) the IM CN subsystem is selected in accordance with the conventions
and rules specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]; and

2\) the UE is currently registered to the 5GS services while the UE is
in an NR cell connected to 5GCN;

then the following treatment is applied:

1\) if the EMC indicates \"Emergency services not supported\":

...

b\) if the UE supports emergency services fallback as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.501 \[257\] and the emergency services fallback is not available
(i.e., \"ESFB is N\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]) and if:

...

ii\) the EMF is set to \"Emergency services fallback not supported\" or
the UE is not capable of accessing 5GCN via E-UTRA, the UE shall disable
the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501
\[257\] and attempt to select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE
finds a suitable E-UTRA cell connected to EPC and the network provides
the UE with the EMC BS set to \"emergency bearer services in S1 mode
supported\" as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[8J\], the UE shall perform
the procedures as described in subclause L.2.2.6 to establish a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services; and

c\) if the UE does not support emergency services fallback as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[257\], the UE shall disable the N1 mode capability
for 3GPP access as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[257\] and attempt to
select an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. If the UE finds a suitable
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC and the network provides the UE with the
EMC BS set to \"emergency bearer services in S1 mode supported\" as
described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[8J\], the UE shall perform the procedures
as described in subclause L.2.2.6 to establish a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services;

##### 11.4.13.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-43 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.229 \[44\], clause 5.1.1.2.1, 5.1.1.5.1, 5.1.6.2A,
5.1.6.8.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.2A\]:

The UE shall perform a new initial emergency registration, as specified
in subclause 5.1.6.2, if the UE determines that:

\- it has previously performed an emergency registration which has not
yet expired; and

\- it has obtained an IP address from the serving IP-CAN, as specified
in subclause 9.2.1, different than the IP address used for the emergency
registration.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.1.2.1\]:

On sending an unprotected REGISTER request, the UE shall populate the
header fields as follows:

a\) a From header field set to the SIP URI that contains:

1\) if the UE supports RFC 6140 \[191\] and performs the functions of an
external attached network, the main URI of the UE; else

2\) the public user identity to be registered;

b\) a To header field set to the SIP URI that contains:

1\) if the UE supports RFC 6140 \[191\] and performs the functions of an
external attached network, the main URI of the UE; else

2\) the public user identity to be registered;

c\) a Contact header field set to include SIP URI(s) containing the IP
address or FQDN of the UE in the hostport parameter. If the UE:

1\) supports GRUU (see table A.4, item A.4/53);

2\) supports multiple registrations;

3\) has an IMEI available; or

4\) has an MEID available;

the UE shall include a \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter
containing the instance ID. Only the IMEI shall be used for generating
an instance ID for a multi-mode UE that supports both 3GPP and 3GPP2
defined radio access networks.

NOTE 2: The requirement placed on the UE to include an instance ID based
on the IMEI or the MEID when the UE does not support GRUU and does not
support multiple registrations does not imply any additional
requirements on the network.

If the UE supports multiple registrations it shall include a \"reg-id\"
header field parameter as described in RFC 5626 \[92\].

The UE shall include all supported ICSI values (coded as specified in
subclause 7.2A.8.2) in a g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as defined in
subclause 7.9.2 and RFC 3840 \[62\] for the IMS communication services
it intends to use, and IARI values (coded as specified in subclause
7.2A.9.2), for the IMS applications it intends to use in a
g.3gpp.iari-ref media feature tag as defined in subclause 7.9.3 and RFC
3840 \[62\].

The UE shall include the media feature tags as defined in RFC 3840
\[62\] for all supported streaming media types.

If the UE supports RFC 6140 \[191\] and performs the functions of an
external attached network, for the registration of bulk number contacts
the UE shall include a Contact URI without a user portion and containing
the \"bnc\" URI parameter.

If the UE has no specific reason not to include a user part in the URI
of the contact address (e.g. some UE performing the functions of an
external attached network), the UE should include a user part in the URI
of the contact address such that the user part is globally unique and
does not reveal any private information;

NOTE 3: A time-based UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) generated as per
subclause 4.2 of RFC 4122 \[154\] is globally unique and does not reveal
any private information.

d\) a Via header field set to include the sent-by field containing the
IP address or FQDN of the UE and the port number where the UE expects to
receive the response to this request when UDP is used. For TCP, the
response is received on the TCP connection on which the request was
sent. For the UDP, the UE shall also include a \"rport\" header field
parameter with no value in the Via header field. Unless the UE has been
configured to not send keep-alives, and unless the UE is directly
connected to an IP-CAN for which usage of NAT is not defined, it shall
include a \"keep\" header field parameter with no value in the Via
header field, in order to indicate support of sending keep-alives
associated with the registration, as described in RFC 6223 \[143\];

NOTE 4: When sending the unprotected REGISTER request using UDP, the UE
transmit the request from the same IP address and port on which it
expects to receive the response to this request.

e\) a registration expiration interval value of 600 000 seconds as the
value desired for the duration of the registration;

NOTE 5: The registrar (S-CSCF) might decrease the duration of the
registration in accordance with network policy. Registration attempts
with a registration period of less than a predefined minimum value
defined in the registrar will be rejected with a 423 (Interval Too
Brief) response.

f\) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home
network used to address the REGISTER request;

g\) the Supported header field containing the option-tag \"path\", and

1\) if GRUU is supported, the option-tag \"gruu\"; and

2\) if multiple registrations is supported, the option-tag \"outbound\".

h\) if a security association or TLS session exists, and if available to
the UE (as defined in the access technology specific annexes for each
access technology), a P-Access-Network-Info header field set as
specified for the access network technology (see subclause 7.2A.4);

i\) a Security-Client header field to announce the media plane security
mechanisms the UE supports, if any, labelled with the \"mediasec\"
header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7;

NOTE 6: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.

j\) if the UE supports RFC 6140 \[191\] and performs the functions of an
external attached network, for the registration of bulk number contacts
the UE shall include a Require header field containing the option-tag
\"gin\"; and

k\) if the UE supports RFC 6140 \[191\] and performs the functions of an
external attached network, for the registration of bulk number contacts
the UE shall include a Proxy-Require header field containing the
option-tag \"gin\".

On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request, the
UE shall:

a\) if available, store the announcement of media plane security
mechanisms the P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports labelled with the \"mediasec\"
header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7 and received in the
Security-Server header field, if any. Once the UE chooses a media
security mechanism from the list received in the Security-Server header
field from the server, the UE may initiate that mechanism on a media
level when it initiates new media in an existing session.

NOTE 7: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.

On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the UE
shall:

a\) store the expiration time of the registration for the public user
identities found in the To header field value and bind it either to the
respective contact address of the UE or to the registration flow and the
associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is
used);

NOTE 8: If the UE supports RFC 6140 \[191\] and performs the functions
of an external attached network, the To header field will contain the
main URI of the UE.

b\) store as the default public user identity the first URI on the list
of URIs present in the P-Associated-URI header field and bind it to the
respective contact address of the UE and the associated set of security
associations or TLS session;

NOTE 9: When using the respective contact address and associated set of
security associations or TLS session, the UE can utilize additional URIs
contained in the P-Associated-URI header field and bound it to the
respective contact address of the UE and the associated set of security
associations or TLS session, e.g. for application purposes.

c\) treat the identity under registration as a barred public user
identity, if it is not included in the P-Associated-URI header field;

d\) store the list of service route values contained in the
Service-Route header field and bind the list either to the contact
address or to the registration flow and the associated contact address
(if the multiple registration mechanism is used), and the associated set
of security associations or TLS session over which the REGISTER request
was sent;

NOTE 10: When multiple registration mechanism is not used, there will be
only one list of service route values bound to a contact address.
However, when multiple registration mechanism is used, there will be
different list of service route values bound to each registration flow
and the associated contact address.

NOTE 11: The UE will use the stored list of service route values to
build a proper preloaded Route header field for new dialogs and
standalone transactions (other than REGISTER method) when using either
the respective contact address or the registration flow and the
associated contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is
used), and the associated set of security associations or TLS session.

e\) if the UE indicated support for GRUU in the Supported header field
of the REGISTER request then:

\- if the UE did not use the procedures specified in RFC 6140 \[191\]
for registration, find the Contact header field within the response that
matches the one included in the REGISTER request. If this contains a
\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter or a \"temp-gruu\" header field
parameter or both, then store the value of those parameters as the GRUUs
for the UE in association with the public user identity and the contact
address that was registered; and

\- if the UE used the procedures specified in RFC 6140 \[191\] for
registration then find the Contact header field within the response that
matches the one included in the REGISTER request. If this contains a
\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter then store the value of the
\"pub-gruu\" header field parameter for use for generating public GRUUs
for registering UAs as specified in RFC 6140 \[191\]. If this contains a
\"temp-gruu-cookie\" header field parameter then store the value of the
\"temp-gruu-cookie\" header field parameter for use for generating
temporary GRUUs for registering UAs as specified in RFC 6140 \[191\];

NOTE 12: When allocating public GRUUs to registering UAs the
functionality within the UE that performs the role of registrar will add
an \"sg\" SIP URI parameter that uniquely identifies that UA to the
public GRUU it received in the \"pub-gruu\" header field parameter. The
procedures for generating a temporary GRUU using the
\"temp-gruu-cookie\" header field parameter are specified in subclause
7.1.2.2 of RFC 6140 \[191\].

f\) if the REGISTER request contained the \"reg-id\" and
\"+sip.instance\" Contact header field parameter and the \"outbound\"
option tag in a Supported header field, the UE shall check whether the
option-tag \"outbound\" is present in the Require header field:

\- if no option-tag \"outbound\" is present, the UE shall conclude that
the S-CSCF does not support the registration procedure as described in
RFC 5626 \[92\], and the S-CSCF has followed the registration procedure
as described in RFC 5627 \[93\] or RFC 3261 \[26\], i.e., if there is a
previously registered contact address, the S-CSCF replaced the old
contact address and associated information with the new contact address
and associated information (see bullet e) above). Upon detecting that
the S-CSCF does not support the registration procedure as defined in RFC
5626 \[92\], the UE shall refrain from registering any additional IMS
flows for the same private identity as described in RFC 5626 \[92\]; or

NOTE 13: Upon replaces the old contact address with the new contact
address, the S-CSCF performs the network initiated deregistration
procedure for the previously registered public user identities and the
associated old contact address as described in subclause 5.4.1.5. Hence,
the UE will receive a NOTIFY request informing the UE about the
deregistration of the old contact address.

\- if an option-tag \"outbound\" is present, the UE may establish
additional IMS flows for the same private identity, as defined in RFC
5626 \[92\];

g\) if available, store the announcement of media plane security
mechanisms the P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports labelled with the \"mediasec\"
header field parameter specified in subclause 7.2A.7 and received in the
Security-Server header field, if any. Once the UE chooses a media
security mechanism from the list received in the Security-Server header
field from the server, it may initiate that mechanism on a media level
when it initiates new media in an existing session;

NOTE 14: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.

h\) if the Via header field contains a \"keep\" header field parameter
with a value, unless the UE detects that it is not behind a NAT, start
to send keep-alives associated with the registration towards the P-CSCF,
as described in RFC 6223 \[143\];

i\) if a Feature-Caps header field, as specified in RFC 6809 \[190\], is
received, a UE supporting the Feature-Caps header field shall consider
the ICSI values received in the Feature-Caps header field of 200 (OK)
response as supported by the IM subsystem for the established
registration or registration flow (if the multiple registration
mechanism is used);

NOTE 15: The UE and related applications can use the ICSI values
received in the Feature-Caps header field of 200 (OK) response to
improve the user experience.

j\) void; and

k\) if the 200 (OK) response includes a Feature-Caps header field, as
specified in RFC 6809 \[190\], with a \"+g.3gpp.verstat\" header field
parameter and if the UE supports calling number verification status
determination, determine that the home network supports calling number
verification using signature verification and attestation information,
as defined in subclause 3.1.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.8.3\]:

After a successful initial emergency registration, the UE shall apply
the procedures as specified in subclause 5.1.2A and 5.1.3 with the
following additions:

1\) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a From header field that
includes the public user identity registered via emergency registration
or the tel URI associated with the public user identity registered via
emergency registration, as described in subclause 4.2;

2\) the UE shall include a service URN in the Request-URI of the INVITE
request in accordance with subclause 5.1.6.8.1;

3\) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header field with
the same emergency service URN as in the Request-URI;

4\) if available to the UE, and if defined for the access type as
specified in subclause 7.2A.4, the P-Access-Network-Info header field
shall contain a location identifier such as the cell id, line id or the
identity of the WLAN access node, which is relevant for routeing the IMS
emergency call;

NOTE 1: The IMS emergency specification in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]
describes several methods how the UE can get its location information
from the access network or from a server. Such methods are not in the
scope of this specification.

5\) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, one or two
P-Preferred-Identity header field(s) that include the public user
identity registered via emergency registration or the tel URI associated
with the public user identity registered via emergency registration as
described in subclause 4.2;

NOTE 2: Providing two P-Preferred-Identity header fields is usually
supported by UE acting as enterprise network.

6\) void;

7\) if the UE has its location information available, or a URI that
points to the location information, then the UE shall include a
Geolocation header field in the INVITE request in the following way:

\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location
is stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as
described in RFC 6442 \[89\]; or

\- if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with RFC 4119
\[90\], include the location object in a message body with the content
type application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL, referring to
the message body, as the Geolocation header field value, as described
RFC 6442 \[89\], and include a Content-Disposition header field with a
disposition type \"render\" value and a \"handling\" header field
parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in RFC 3261 \[26\];

8\) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also
include a Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field
value, which indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other
entities to make routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 \[89\];

NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a
URI when the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF
provider. This is an issue on which the network operator needs to
provide guidance to the end user. A URI that is only resolvable to the
UE which is making the emergency call is not desirable.

9\) if the UE has neither geographical location information available,
nor a URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not
insert a Geolocation header field in the INVITE request; and

10\) if support of the current location discovery during an emergency
call is allowed in the IP-CAN specific annex and the UE supports the
current location discovery during an emergency call, the UE shall
include a Recv-Info header field as described in RFC 6086 \[25\],
indicating the g.3gpp.current-location-discovery info package name and
shall include an Accept header field indicating the
\"application/vnd.3gpp.current-location-discovery+xml\" MIME type.

NOTE 4: RFC 3261 \[26\] provides for the use of the Priority header
field with a suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that
emergency sessions contain this value, but such usage will have no
impact on the processing within the IM CN subsystem.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.1.4.1\]:

The UE can perform the reregistration of a previously registered public
user identity via an initial registration as specified in subclause
5.1.1.2, when binding the previously registered public user identity to
new contact address or to the registration flow and the associated
contact address (if the multiple registration mechanism is used).

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.1.2.2\]

On sending a REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE
shall additionally populate the header fields as follows:

a\) an Authorization header field, with:

\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the
private user identity;

\- the \"realm\" header field parameter, set to the domain name of the
home network;

\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain
name of the home network;

\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to an empty value; and

\- the \"response\" header field parameter, set to an empty value;

NOTE 1: If the UE specifies its FQDN in the hostport parameter in the
Contact header field and in the sent-by field in the Via header field,
then it has to ensure that the given FQDN will resolve (e.g., by reverse
DNS lookup) to the IP address that is bound to the security association.

NOTE 2: The UE associates two ports, a protected client port and a
protected server port, with each pair of security association. For
details on the selection of the port values see 3GPP TS 33.203 \[19\].

b\) additionally for the Contact header field, if the REGISTER request
is protected by a security association, include the protected server
port value in the hostport parameter;

c\) additionally for the Via header field, for UDP, if the REGISTER
request is protected by a security association, include the protected
server port value in the sent-by field; and

d\) a Security-Client header field set to specify the signalling plane
security mechanism the UE supports, the IPsec layer algorithms the UE
supports and the parameters needed for the security association setup.
The UE shall support the setup of two pairs of security associations as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 \[19\]. The syntax of the parameters needed
for the security association setup is specified in annex H of 3GPP TS
33.203 \[19\]. The UE shall support the \"ipsec-3gpp\" security
mechanism, as specified in RFC 3329 \[48\]. The UE shall support the
IPsec layer algorithms for integrity and confidentiality protection as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 \[19\], and shall announce support for them
according to the procedures defined in RFC 3329 \[48\].

On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request defined in
subclause 5.1.1.2.1, the UE shall additionally:

1\) If the UE supports multiple registrations and the REGISTER request
contained the \"+sip.instance\" header field parameter and the
\"reg-id\" header field parameter in the Contact header field, and the
\"outbound\" option-tag in the Supported header field, the UE shall
check whether the option-tag \"outbound\" is present in the Require
header field. If the option-tag \"outbound\" is present, then the UE
shall use the bidirectional flow as defined in RFC 5626 \[92\] as
follows:

a\) for UDP, the bidirectional flow consists of two unidirectional
flows, i.e. the first unidirectional flow is identified with the UE\'s
protected client port, the P-CSCF\'s protected server port, and the
respective IP addresses. The UE uses this flow to send the requests and
responses to the P-CSCF. The second unidirectional flow is identified
with the P-CSCF\'s protected client port, the UE\'s protected server
port and the IP addresses. The second unidirectional flow is used by the
UE to receive the requests and responses from the P-CSCF; or

b\) for TCP, the bidirectional flow is the TCP connection between the UE
and the P-CSCF. This TCP connection was established by the UE, i.e. from
the UE\'s protected client port and the UE\'s IP address to the
P-CSCF\'s protected server port and the P-CSCF\'s IP address. This TCP
connection is used to exchange SIP messages between the UE and the
P-CSCF; and

2\) set the security association lifetime to the longest of either the
previously existing security association lifetime (if available), or the
lifetime of the just completed registration plus 30 seconds.

NOTE 3: If the UE receives Authentication-Info, it will proceed as
described in RFC 3310 \[49\].

When a 401 (Unauthorized) response to a REGISTER is received the UE
shall behave as described in subclause 5.1.1.5.1.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.1.5.1\]:

On receiving a 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request, the
UE shall:

1\) extract the RAND and AUTN parameters;

2\) check the validity of a received authentication challenge, as
described in 3GPP TS 33.203 \[19\] i.e. the locally calculated XMAC must
match the MAC parameter derived from the AUTN part of the challenge; and
the SQN parameter derived from the AUTN part of the challenge must be
within the correct range; and

3\) check the existence of the Security-Server header field as described
in RFC 3329 \[48\]. If the Security-Server header field is not present
or it does not contain the parameters required for the setup of the set
of security associations (see annex H of 3GPP TS 33.203 \[19\]), the UE
shall abandon the authentication procedure and send a new REGISTER
request with a new Call-ID.

In the case that the 401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request
is deemed to be valid the UE shall:

1\) calculate the RES parameter and derive the keys CK and IK from RAND
as described in 3GPP TS 33.203 \[19\];

2\) set up a temporary set of security associations for this
registration based on the static list and parameters the UE received in
the 401 (Unauthorized) response and its capabilities sent in the
Security-Client header field in the REGISTER request. The UE sets up the
temporary set of security associations using the most preferred
mechanism and algorithm returned by the P-CSCF and supported by the UE
and using IK and CK (only if encryption enabled) as the shared key. The
UE shall use the parameters received in the Security-Server header field
to setup the temporary set of security associations. The UE shall set a
temporary SIP level lifetime for the temporary set of security
associations to the value of reg-await-auth timer;

3\) store the announcement of the media plane security mechanisms the
P-CSCF (IMS-ALG) supports received in the Security-Server header field
and labelled with the \"mediasec\" header field parameter specified in
subclause 7.2A.7, if any; and

NOTE 1: The \"mediasec\" header field parameter indicates that security
mechanisms are specific to the media plane.

4\) send another REGISTER request towards the protected server port
indicated in the response using the temporary set of security
associations to protect the message. The header fields are populated as
defined for the initial REGISTER request that was challenged with the
received 401 (Unauthorized) response, with the addition that the UE
shall include an Authorization header field containing:

\- the \"realm\" header field parameter set to the value as received in
the \"realm\" WWW-Authenticate header field parameter;

\- the \"username\" header field parameter, set to the value of the
private user identity;

\- the \"response\" header field parameter that contains the RES
parameter, as described in RFC 3310 \[49\];

\- the \"uri\" header field parameter, set to the SIP URI of the domain
name of the home network;

\- the \"algorithm\" header field parameter, set to the value received
in the 401 (Unauthorized) response; and

\- the \"nonce\" header field parameter, set to the value received in
the 401 (Unauthorized) response.

The UE shall also insert the Security-Client header field that is
identical to the Security-Client header field that was included in the
previous REGISTER request (i.e. the REGISTER request that was challenged
with the received 401 (Unauthorized) response). The UE shall also insert
the Security-Verify header field into the request, by mirroring in it
the content of the Security-Server header field received in the 401
(Unauthorized) response. The UE shall set the Call-ID of the security
association protected REGISTER request which carries the authentication
challenge response to the same value as the Call-ID of the 401
(Unauthorized) response which carried the challenge.

NOTE 2: The Security-Client header field contains signalling plane
security mechanism and if the UE supports media plane security, then
media plane security mechanisms are contained, too.

On receiving the 200 (OK) response for the security association
protected REGISTER request registering a public user identity with the
associated contact address, the UE shall:

\- change the temporary set of security associations to a newly
established set of security associations, i.e. set its SIP level
lifetime to the longest of either the previously existing set of
security associations SIP level lifetime, or the lifetime of the just
completed registration plus 30 seconds; and

\- if this is the only set of security associations available toward the
P-CSCF, use the newly established set of security associations for
further messages sent towards the P-CSCF. If there are additional sets
of security associations (e.g. due to registration of multiple contact
addresses), the UE can either use them or use the newly established set
of security associations for further messages sent towards the P-CSCF as
appropriate.

request in accordance with subclause 5.1.6.8.1;

3\) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, a To header field with
the same emergency service URN as in the Request-URI;

4\) if available to the UE, and if defined for the access type as
specified in subclause 7.2A.4, the P-Access-Network-Info header field
shall contain a location identifier such as the cell id, line id or the
identity of the WLAN access node, which is relevant for routeing the IMS
emergency call;

NOTE 1: The IMS emergency specification in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]
describes several methods how the UE can get its location information
from the access network or from a server. Such methods are not in the
scope of this specification.

5\) the UE shall insert in the INVITE request, one or two
P-Preferred-Identity header field(s) that include the public user
identity registered via emergency registration or the tel URI associated
with the public user identity registered via emergency registration as
described in subclause 4.2;

NOTE 2: Providing two P-Preferred-Identity header fields is usually
supported by UE acting as enterprise network.

6\) void;

7\) if the UE has its location information available, or a URI that
points to the location information, then the UE shall include a
Geolocation header field in the INVITE request in the following way:

\- if the UE is aware of the URI that points to where the UE\'s location
is stored, include the URI as the Geolocation header field value, as
described in RFC 6442 \[89\]; or

\- if the UE is aware of its location information, include the location
information in a PIDF location object, in accordance with RFC 4119
\[90\], include the location object in a message body with the content
type application/pidf+xml, and include a Content ID URL, referring to
the message body, as the Geolocation header field value, as described
RFC 6442 \[89\], and include a Content-Disposition header field with a
disposition type \"render\" value and a \"handling\" header field
parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in RFC 3261 \[26\];

8\) if the UE includes a Geolocation header field, the UE shall also
include a Geolocation-Routing header field with a \"yes\" header field
value, which indicates that the location of the UE can be used by other
entities to make routing decisions, as described in RFC 6442 \[89\];

NOTE 3: It is suggested that UE\'s only use the option of providing a
URI when the domain part belongs to the current P-CSCF or S-CSCF
provider. This is an issue on which the network operator needs to
provide guidance to the end user. A URI that is only resolvable to the
UE which is making the emergency call is not desirable.

9\) if the UE has neither geographical location information available,
nor a URI that points to the location information, the UE shall not
insert a Geolocation header field in the INVITE request; and

10\) if support of the current location discovery during an emergency
call is allowed in the IP-CAN specific annex and the UE supports the
current location discovery during an emergency call, the UE shall
include a Recv-Info header field as described in RFC 6086 \[25\],
indicating the g.3gpp.current-location-discovery info package name and
shall include an Accept header field indicating the
\"application/vnd.3gpp.current-location-discovery+xml\" MIME type.

NOTE 4: RFC 3261 \[26\] provides for the use of the Priority header
field with a suggested value of \"emergency\". It is not precluded that
emergency sessions contain this value, but such usage will have no
impact on the processing within the IM CN subsystem.

##### 11.5.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-46 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501, clauses 5.1.3.2.1.3.8, 5.3.1.3, 5.5.3, TS
24.301, clauses 10.2 and TS 38.331, clauses 5.2.2.4.2, 6.2.2. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.1.3.8\]

The substate 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE is chosen in the UE when:

a\) the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\];

b\) timer T3444 and timer T3445 have expired or are not running;

c\) a PLMN has been selected as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\];

d\) the UE does not need to perform an eCall over IMS; and

e\) the UE does not need to perform a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or
URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service.

In this substate, the UE shall not initiate any signalling towards the
network, except to originate an eCall over IMS, or a call to a
non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration
service.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.3.1.3\]

The signalling procedure for the release of the N1 NAS signalling
connection is initiated by the network.

In N1 mode, upon indication from lower layers that the access stratum
connection has been released, the UE shall enter 5GMM-IDLE mode and
consider the N1 NAS signalling connection released.

If the UE in 3GPP access is configured for eCall only mode as specified
in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] then:

\- if the N1 NAS signalling connection that was released had been
established for eCall over IMS, the UE shall start timer T3444; and

\- if the N1 NAS signalling connection that was released had been
established for a call to an HPLMN designated non-emergency MSISDN or
URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service, the UE shall start
timer T3445.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.3\]

The eCall inactivity procedure is performed only in 3GPP access and
applicable only to a UE configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]. The procedure shall be started when:

a\) the UE is in any 5GMM-REGISTERED substate except substates
5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH or 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

b\) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode; and

c\) one of the following conditions applies:

1\) timer T3444 expires or is found to have already expired and timer
T3445 is not running;

2\) timer T3445 expires or is found to have already expired and timer
T3444 is not running; or

3\) timers T3444 and T3445 expire or are found to have already expired.

The UE shall then perform the following actions:

a\) stop other running timers (e.g. T3511, T3512);

b\) if the UE is currently registered to the network for 5GS services,
perform a de-registration procedure;

c\) delete any 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of
equivalent PLMNs, and ngKSI; and

d\) enter 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state.

##### 11.5.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-47 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 24.501, clauses 5.1.3.2.1.3.8, 5.3.1.3, 5.5.3, TS
24.301, clauses 10.2 and TS 38.331, clauses 5.2.2.4.2, 6.2.2. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.1.3.8\]

The substate 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE is chosen in the UE when:

a\) the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\];

b\) timer T3444 and timer T3445 have expired or are not running;

c\) a PLMN has been selected as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\];

d\) the UE does not need to perform an eCall over IMS; and

e\) the UE does not need to perform a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or
URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service.

In this substate, the UE shall not initiate any signalling towards the
network, except to originate an eCall over IMS, or a call to a
non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration
service.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.3.1.3\]

The signalling procedure for the release of the N1 NAS signalling
connection is initiated by the network.

In N1 mode, upon indication from lower layers that the access stratum
connection has been released, the UE shall enter 5GMM-IDLE mode and
consider the N1 NAS signalling connection released.

If the UE in 3GPP access is configured for eCall only mode as specified
in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\] then:

\- if the N1 NAS signalling connection that was released had been
established for eCall over IMS, the UE shall start timer T3444; and

\- if the N1 NAS signalling connection that was released had been
established for a call to an HPLMN designated non-emergency MSISDN or
URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service, the UE shall start
timer T3445.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.3\]

The eCall inactivity procedure is performed only in 3GPP access and
applicable only to a UE configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]. The procedure shall be started when:

a\) the UE is in any 5GMM-REGISTERED substate except substates
5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH or 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

b\) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode; and

c\) one of the following conditions applies:

1\) timer T3444 expires or is found to have already expired and timer
T3445 is not running;

2\) timer T3445 expires or is found to have already expired and timer
T3444 is not running; or

3\) timers T3444 and T3445 expire or are found to have already expired.

The UE shall then perform the following actions:

a\) stop other running timers (e.g. T3511, T3512);

b\) if the UE is currently registered to the network for 5GS services,
perform a de-registration procedure;

c\) delete any 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of
equivalent PLMNs, and ngKSI; and

d\) enter 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state.

### 11.5.3 eCall Only mode / 5GS supports IMS voice over PS session / 5GS does not support emergency service / eCall over EPS / eCall failure if EPS and CS domain are not available

##### 11.5.3.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-49 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-122 .H6}

**with** { UE is switched ON with eCall only enabled USIM }

**ensure that** {

**when** { 5GS supports IMS voice over PS session but
ims-EmergencySupport on 5GS is not indicated, eCallOverIMS-Support-r14
and ims-EmergencySupport on EPS is indicated and UE is requested to make
an automatic eCall }

**then** { UE establishes the eCall over EPS }

}

##### (2) {#section-123 .H6}

**with** { UE is switched ON with eCall only enabled USIM }

**ensure that** {

**when** { 5GS supports IMS voice over PS session but
ims-EmergencySupport on 5GS is not indicated and other RATs are not
available and UE is requested to make an automatic eCall }

**then** { UE does not establish a normal emergency call, eCall over IMS
or eCall over CS domain }

}

##### 11.5.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-48 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 23.122, clause 4.4.3.1.1 and TS 23.167, Annex H.6.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 23.122 clause 4.4.3.1.1\]

The MS selects and attempts registration on other PLMN/access technology
combinations, if available and, for bullets i, ii, iii, iv, v,
allowable, in the following order:

i\) either the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or
the highest priority EHPLMN that is available (if the EHPLMN list is
present) ;

ii\) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"User Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority
order);

iii\) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM
(in priority order) or stored in the ME (in priority order);

iv\) other PLMN/access technology combinations with received high
quality signal in random order;

NOTE 1: High quality signal is defined in the appropriate AS
specification.

v\) other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of decreasing
signal quality.

...

l\) In i to vii, if the MS is in eCall only mode, the MS shall not
consider PLMNs which do not advertise support for eCall over IMS, unless
such PLMNs are available in GERAN or UTRAN.

NOTE 6: As an implementation option, an MS in eCall only mode that was
not able to select any PLMN according to l) can perform a second
iteration of i to v with no restriction.

##### 11.5.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-50 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 23.122 \[38\], subclause 2

\[TS 23.122 clause 2\]

If the MS is in eCall only mode, it attempts to camp on a suitable cell
and enters an \"eCall inactive\" state in which it can only attempt an
eCall over IMS, or a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or
terminal reconfiguration services as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[40\].

If the MS is in eCall only mode and is unable to find a suitable cell to
camp on, it attempts to camp on an acceptable cell in limited service
state, and enters an \"eCall inactive\" state in which it can only
attempt an eCall over IMS.

### 11.5.6 eCall capable / 5GS supports IMS voice over PS session / 5GS supports emergency service / eCall over IMS is not supported / eCall using the CS domain / emergency call over IMS if eCall using the CS domain is not available / UTRA

##### 11.5.6.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-52 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-127 .H6}

**with** { UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and 5GMM-IDLE mode
}

**ensure that** {

**when** { *eCallOverIMS-Support* is not indicated in SIB1 and UE is
requested to make an automatic eCall and UTRA Cell is available }

**then** { UE establishes the eCall using the CS domain (UTRA) }

}

##### (2) {#section-128 .H6}

**with** { UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and 5GMM-IDLE mode
}

ensure that {

**when** { *eCallOverIMS-Support* is not indicated in SIB1 and UE is
requested to make an automatic eCall }

**then** { UE establishes an RRC connection for normal emergency call
with the RRC *establishmentCause* set to \"emergency\", **and**, sends a
SERVICE REQUEST message with Service type IE set to \"emergency
services\" }

}

##### 11.5.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-51 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331, clauses 5.2.2.4.2, 6.2.2 and TS 23.167, Annex
H.6.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.2.2.4.2\]

Upon receiving the *SIB1* the UE shall:

1\> store the acquired *SIB1*;

...

4\> forward the *eCallOverIMS-Support* to upper layers, if present;

\[TS 38.331, clause 6.2.2\]

##### eCallOverIMS-Support {#ecalloverims-support-4 .H6}

Indicates whether the cell supports eCall over IMS services as defined
in TS 23.501 \[32\]. If absent, eCall over IMS is not supported by the
network in the cell.

\[TS 23.167, clause H.6\]

This clause details the domain priority and selection (see clause 7.3)
for a UE that attempts to make an eCall over IMS session using E-UTRAN
or NG-RAN radio access networks based on the availability of the CS or
PS domains and the network support for IMS emergency, eCall over IMS and
IMS voice over PS.

The following table (Table H.2) defines these rules based on the UE
(last 2 columns) for different initial conditions (first 4 columns) when
an eCall over IMS session is initiated and when the UE is not in limited
service state.

NOTE: If the E-UTRAN and NG-RAN cells available to the UE have different
settings, the UE assumes \"PS Available\" and \"ECL\" apply to whichever
cell is indicated (as defined in TS 23.401 \[28\] and TS 23.501 \[48\])
as providing eCall over IMS support. When support by more than one cell
is indicated, a UE may select any cell to attempt eCall over IMS
according to the UE implementation.

\[TS 23.237, clause 5.3.3\]

The Emergency Access Transfer Function (EATF) provides IMS-based
mechanisms for enabling service continuity of IMS emergency sessions and
eCall over IMS. It is a function in the serving (visited if roaming) IMS
network, providing the procedures for IMS emergency session anchoring
and PS to CS Access Transfer. The EATF acts as a routing B2BUA which
invokes third party call control (3pcc) for enablement of Access
Transfer.

When supporting PS to CS DRVCC for IMS emergency, the EATF provides the
following functions:

\- Generates and sends an E-STN-DR to UE for session continuity
procedure toward the CS domain. The E-STN-DR is used by the EATF to
correlate two access legs, and is unique for each access transfer
function within an EATF.

The EATF performs the session continuity when the Access Transfer
request indicated by the E-STN-SR is received.

\[TS 23.237, clause 6c.2.1\]

Figure 6c.2.1-1 provides flow for SRVCC for IMS emergency session, when
the IMS emergency session is active session. This applies when a single
EATF instance is deployed (see clause 6c.2.3 for multiple EATF
instances).

Figure 6c.2.1-1: IMS level Call flow for SRVCC for IMS emergency session
with E-STN-SR with a single EATF instance

1\. MSC Server initiates the session transfer with the E-STN-SR and it
includes the equipment identifier.

2\. The I-CSCF routes the INVITE directly to the EATF via I5 by using
similar procedures to that defined in TS 23.228 \[4\] for PSI based
Application Server termination.

NOTE 1: The use of indirect routeing for PSI based Application Server
Termination as described in TS 23.228 \[4\] in clause 5.7.6 cannot be
used for routing the INVITE to the EATF.

3 - 4. The EATF uses the E-STN-SR to determine that Access Transfer is
requested. The EATF proceeds with the Access Transfer of the active
session with bi-directional speech for the UE by updating the Remote Leg
with the media description and other information using the Remote Leg
Update procedure as specified in clause 6.3.1.5. For SRVCC session
transfer of an eCall over IMS, the EATF indicates in the reINVITE that
the EATF shall exclude INFO requests for any Info Packages related to
eCall over IMS as defined in RFC 6086 \[34\] clause 5.2.2.

NOTE: Indicating an unwillingness to receive INFO requests will prevent
an emergency centre/PSAP from sending an INFO message to request an
updated MSD from the UE.

5\. The E-CSCF forwards the Re-INVITE to the MGCF associated with the
PSAP if the PSAP is located in the PSTN or CS Domain (the u-plane path
is switched between the UE and the MGW) or the Re-INVITE is sent
directly to an IP-capable PSAP (the u-plane path between the UE and the
PSAP is switched end-to-end).

6\. When session modification procedures complete, the source access leg
(i.e. the access leg previously established over IMS) is released as
specified in clause 6.3.1.6.

NOTE 2: If non-voice media was part of the original Multimedia emergency
call session, the non-voice media will be released.

\[TS 26.267, clause 4.3\]

After an emergency voice call has been (automatically or manually)
established, the IVS modem receiver constantly monitors the incoming
signal from the speech decoder output. When prompted by a request from
the PSAP operator for MSD, the IVS connects the IVS data modem
transmitter to the input of the speech coder and mutes any speech from
the motorist for the duration of MSD transmission to prevent it from
interfering with the eCall data transmission. Alternatively, it can be
the IVS that may trigger the MSD transmission. In this case, the IVS
asks the PSAP to request an MSD transmission.

The first operation mode shall be referred to as the *pull* mode whereas
the latter one is the *push* mode. Essentially, push mode is realized by
a request from the IVS to the PSAP to *pull* the MSD.

The requirement about the modem to be configured in either *push* or
*pull* mode is beyond the scope of this specification. Refer to clause
4.2 for a reproduction of eCall service requirements.

\[TS 24.008, clause 5.2.4.2\]

If the MS supports single radio PS to CS access transfer for calls in
alerting state as specified in 3GPP TS 24.237 \[136\] subclause 12.2.3B,
and the MS has a single voice media stream over the PS domain that is
handed over to the CS domain via SRVCC, and the call control entity of
the MS in the \"null\" state receives an indication \"MM connection
establishment due to SRVCC handover\" then:

\- the call control entity shall indicate to the upper layers that call
establishment is due to SRVCC handover;

\- if the upper layers indicate that the media stream(s) is/are
associated with a mobile originated session in the \"early\" state
(defined in IETF RFC 3261 \[137\]) according to the conditions specified
in 3GPP TS 24.237 \[136\] subclause 12.2.3B.3.2, the call control entity
of the MS shall enter the \"call delivered\" state for this transaction.
The MS and the network shall locally set the TI value of the call to
\"000\" and the TI flag value as in mobile terminated call; and

\...

If the MS has additional voice media streams carried over the PS domain
that are handed over to the CS domain via SRVCC, the call states for the
transactions and the setting of the TI value and TI flag for these
additional media streams are described in 3GPP TS 24.237 \[136\].

### 11.5.8 eCall Only mode / 5GS supports IMS voice over PS session / 5GS supports emergency service / eCall over IMS is supported / RACH failure in NR cell / eCall using the CS domain

##### 11.5.8.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-54 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-130 .H6}

**with** { UE is in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE is requested to make an automatic eCall over IMS and RACH
failure is observed in NR cell }

**then** { UE establishes the eCall using CS domain (UTRA or GERAN) }

}

##### 11.5.8.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-53 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 23.167, Annex H.6.

\[TS 23.167 Annex H.6\]

This clause details the domain priority and selection (see clause 7.3)
for a UE that attempts to make an eCall over IMS session using E-UTRAN
or NG-RAN radio access networks based on the availability of the CS or
PS domains and the network support for IMS emergency, eCall over IMS and
IMS voice over PS.

The following table (Table H.2) defines these rules based on the UE
(last 2 columns) for different initial conditions (first 4 columns) when
an eCall over IMS session is initiated and when the UE is not in limited
service state.

##### 11.5.9.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-54 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.229 \[44\], clauses 5.1.6.11.1, 5.1.6.11.2 and TS
23.167, Annex H.6.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.11.1\]

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the manually initiated eCall type of emergency service, the service URN
shall be \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\" as specified in
RFC 8147 \[244\].

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service, the service
URN shall be \"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\" as specified in
RFC 8147 \[244\].

NOTE 1: The manually initiated eCall type of emergency service is used
when the eCall IMS emergency session is invoked with user input. The
automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service is used if the
eCall IMS emergency session is invoked without user input.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.11.2\]

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service or of the
manually initiated eCall type of emergency service and if allowed by
IP-CAN specific annex, the UE shall send an INVITE request as specified
in the procedures in subclause 5.1.6.8 with the following additions:

1\) the UE shall set the Request-URI to
\"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\" or \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\";
and

2\) if the IP-CAN indicates the eCall support indication, the UE shall:

a\) insert a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" MIME body part as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\], containing the MSD not exceeding 140 bytes and encoded
in binary ASN.1 PER as specified in CEN EN 15722:2015 \[245\] and
include a Content-Disposition header field with a \"handling\" header
field parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in
RFC 3261 \[26\];

b\) insert an Accept header field indicating the UE is willing to accept
an \"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME type as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\]; and

c\) insert a Recv-Info header field set to
\"EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

NOTE: Further content for the INVITE is as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

Then the UE shall proceed as follows:

...

3\) if the UE receives a 486 (Busy Here), 600 (Busy Everywhere) or 603
(Decline) response to the INVITE request containing:

a\) a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME body part as defined
in RFC 8147 \[244\] with an \"ack\" element containing:

i\) a \"received\" attribute set to \"true\"; and

ii\) a \"ref\" attribute set to the Content-ID of the MIME body part
containing the MSD sent by the UE;

then the UE shall consider the initial MSD transmission as successful
and shall perform domain selection to re-attempt the eCall as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]; and

4\) in all other cases, the UE shall perform domain selection to
re-attempt the eCall as specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\].

##### 11.5.10.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-55 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.229 \[44\], clauses 5.1.6.11.1, 5.1.6.11.2 and TS
23.167, Annex H.6.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.11.1\]

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the manually initiated eCall type of emergency service, the service URN
shall be \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\" as specified in
RFC 8147 \[244\].

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service, the service
URN shall be \"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\" as specified in
RFC 8147 \[244\].

NOTE 1: The manually initiated eCall type of emergency service is used
when the eCall IMS emergency session is invoked with user input. The
automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service is used if the
eCall IMS emergency session is invoked without user input.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.11.2\]

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service or of the
manually initiated eCall type of emergency service and if allowed by
IP-CAN specific annex, the UE shall send an INVITE request as specified
in the procedures in subclause 5.1.6.8 with the following additions:

1\) the UE shall set the Request-URI to
\"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\" or \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\";
and

2\) if the IP-CAN indicates the eCall support indication, the UE shall:

a\) insert a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" MIME body part as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\], containing the MSD not exceeding 140 bytes and encoded
in binary ASN.1 PER as specified in CEN EN 15722:2015 \[245\] and
include a Content-Disposition header field with a \"handling\" header
field parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in
RFC 3261 \[26\];

b\) insert an Accept header field indicating the UE is willing to accept
an \"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME type as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\]; and

c\) insert a Recv-Info header field set to
\"EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

NOTE: Further content for the INVITE is as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

Then the UE shall proceed as follows:

...

3\) if the UE receives a 486 (Busy Here), 600 (Busy Everywhere) or 603
(Decline) response to the INVITE request containing:

a\) a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME body part as defined
in RFC 8147 \[244\] with an \"ack\" element containing:

i\) a \"received\" attribute set to \"true\"; and

ii\) a \"ref\" attribute set to the Content-ID of the MIME body part
containing the MSD sent by the UE;

then the UE shall consider the initial MSD transmission as successful
and shall perform domain selection to re-attempt the eCall as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]; and

4\) in all other cases, the UE shall perform domain selection to
re-attempt the eCall as specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\].

##### 11.5.11.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-56 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.229 \[44\], clauses 5.1.6.11.1, 5.1.6.11.2 and TS
23.167, Annex H.6.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.11.1\]

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the manually initiated eCall type of emergency service, the service URN
shall be \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\" as specified in
RFC 8147 \[244\].

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service, the service
URN shall be \"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\" as specified in
RFC 8147 \[244\].

NOTE 1: The manually initiated eCall type of emergency service is used
when the eCall IMS emergency session is invoked with user input. The
automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service is used if the
eCall IMS emergency session is invoked without user input.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.11.2\]

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service or of the
manually initiated eCall type of emergency service and if allowed by
IP-CAN specific annex, the UE shall send an INVITE request as specified
in the procedures in subclause 5.1.6.8 with the following additions:

1\) the UE shall set the Request-URI to
\"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\" or \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\";
and

2\) if the IP-CAN indicates the eCall support indication, the UE shall:

a\) insert a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" MIME body part as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\], containing the MSD not exceeding 140 bytes and encoded
in binary ASN.1 PER as specified in CEN EN 15722:2015 \[245\] and
include a Content-Disposition header field with a \"handling\" header
field parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in
RFC 3261 \[26\];

b\) insert an Accept header field indicating the UE is willing to accept
an \"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME type as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\]; and

c\) insert a Recv-Info header field set to
\"EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

NOTE: Further content for the INVITE is as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

Then the UE shall proceed as follows:

...

3\) if the UE receives a 486 (Busy Here), 600 (Busy Everywhere) or 603
(Decline) response to the INVITE request containing:

a\) a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME body part as defined
in RFC 8147 \[244\] with an \"ack\" element containing:

i\) a \"received\" attribute set to \"true\"; and

ii\) a \"ref\" attribute set to the Content-ID of the MIME body part
containing the MSD sent by the UE;

then the UE shall consider the initial MSD transmission as successful
and shall perform domain selection to re-attempt the eCall as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]; and

4\) in all other cases, the UE shall perform domain selection to
re-attempt the eCall as specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\].

##### 11.5.13.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-58 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.229 \[44\], clauses 5.1.6.11.2, 5.1.6.8.1, Table
7.8.1 and TS 23.167, Annex H.6.

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.11.2\]

If the upper layers request establishment of an IMS emergency call of
the automatically initiated eCall type of emergency service or of the
manually initiated eCall type of emergency service and if allowed by
IP-CAN specific annex, the UE shall send an INVITE request as specified
in the procedures in subclause 5.1.6.8 with the following additions:

1\) the UE shall set the Request-URI to
\"urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic\" or \"urn:service:sos.ecall.manual\";
and

2\) if the IP-CAN indicates the eCall support indication, the UE shall:

a\) insert a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" MIME body part as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\], containing the MSD not exceeding 140 bytes and encoded
in binary ASN.1 PER as specified in CEN EN 15722:2015 \[245\] and
include a Content-Disposition header field with a \"handling\" header
field parameter with an \"optional\" value, as described in
RFC 3261 \[26\];

b\) insert an Accept header field indicating the UE is willing to accept
an \"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME type as defined in
RFC 8147 \[244\]; and

c\) insert a Recv-Info header field set to
\"EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD\" as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

NOTE: Further content for the INVITE is as defined in RFC 8147 \[244\].

Then the UE shall proceed as follows:

1\) if the UE receives a 200 (OK) response to the INVITE request not
containing:

a\) a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME body part as defined
in RFC 8147 \[244\] with an \"ack\" element containing:

i\) a \"received\" attribute set to \"true\"; and

ii\) a \"ref\" attribute set to the Content-ID of the MIME body part
containing the MSD sent by the UE;

then the UE shall send the MSD using audio media stream encoded as
described in 3GPP TS 26.267 \[9C\];

2\) if the UE receives a 200 (OK) response to the INVITE request
containing:

a\) a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME body part as defined
in RFC 8147 \[244\] with an \"ack\" element containing:

i\) a \"received\" attribute set to \"true\"; and

ii\) a \"ref\" attribute set to the Content-ID of the MIME body part
containing the MSD sent by the UE;

then the UE shall consider the initial MSD transmission as successful;

3\) if the UE receives a 486 (Busy Here), 600 (Busy Everywhere) or 603
(Decline) response to the INVITE request containing:

a\) a multipart/mixed body containing an
\"application/EmergencyCallData.Control+xml\" MIME body part as defined
in RFC 8147 \[244\] with an \"ack\" element containing:

i\) a \"received\" attribute set to \"true\"; and

ii\) a \"ref\" attribute set to the Content-ID of the MIME body part
containing the MSD sent by the UE;

then the UE shall consider the initial MSD transmission as successful
and shall perform domain selection to re-attempt the eCall as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\]; and

4\) in all other cases, the UE shall perform domain selection to
re-attempt the eCall as specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\].

\[TS 24.229 clause 5.1.6.8.1\]

If the UE supports the emerg-request timer defined in Table 7.8.1, the
UE shall start the emerg-request timer when sending the initial INVITE
request for emergency service. The UE shall stop the timer upon receipt
of any 18x provisional SIP response. When the emerg-request timer
expires, the UE shall consider that the emergency service request has
failed and apply the procedures related to emergency service request
failure that are defined in 3GPP TS 23.167 \[4B\] subclause 7.3 with
clarifications in clause H.5. The UE may support being configured for
the emerg-request timer using one or more of the following methods:

a\) the Timer\_Emerg-request leaf of the EF~IMSConfigDat~a file
described in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[15C\];

b\) the Timer\_Emerg-request leaf of the EF~IMSConfigData~ file
described in 3GPP TS 31.103 \[15B\]; and

c\) the Timer\_Emerg-request leaf of 3GPP TS 24.167 \[8G\].

If the UE is configured with both the Timer\_Emerg-request leaf of
3GPP TS 24.167 \[8G\] and the Timer\_Emerg-request leaf of the
EF~IMSConfigData~ file described in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[15C\] or
3GPP TS 31.103 \[15B\], then the Timer\_Emerg-request leaf of the
EF~IMSConfigData~ file shall take precedence.

##### (1) {#section-136 .H6}

**with** { UE is switched ON with eCall only enabled USIM }

**ensure that** {

**when** { 5GS supports IMS voice over PS session but
ims-EmergencySupport on 5GS is not indicated and UE is requested to make
an automatic eCall }

**then** { UE establishes the eCall using the CS domain(UTRA or GERAN) }

##### 11.5.14.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-59 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 23.122, clause 4.4.3.1.1 and TS 23.167, Annex H.6.

\[TS 23.122 clause 4.4.3.1.1\]

The MS selects and attempts registration on other PLMN/access technology
combinations, if available and, for bullets i, ii, iii, iv, v,
allowable, in the following order:

i\) either the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or
the highest priority EHPLMN that is available (if the EHPLMN list is
present) ;

ii\) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"User Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority
order);

iii\) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM
(in priority order) or stored in the ME (in priority order);

iv\) other PLMN/access technology combinations with received high
quality signal in random order;

NOTE 1: High quality signal is defined in the appropriate AS
specification.

v\) other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of decreasing
signal quality.

...

l\) In i to vii, if the MS is in eCall only mode, the MS shall not
consider PLMNs which do not advertise support for eCall over IMS, unless
such PLMNs are available in GERAN or UTRAN.

NOTE 6: As an implementation option, an MS in eCall only mode that was
not able to select any PLMN according to l) can perform a second
iteration of i to v with no restriction.

##### 11.6.1.2 Conformance Requirements {#conformance-requirements-60 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.2.10. TS 24.229 \[44\] clause 4.17,
Rel-15. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.2.10\]

In case of PLMN, a UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), can be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS
data off exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] or in the
EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ USIM file as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]:

a\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN
or EHPLMN; and

b\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN.

If only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the
HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured at the UE, this list shall be also used in
the VPLMN.

In case of SNPN, a UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), can be configured with a list of 3GPP PS data off
exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] for each SNPN
whose entry exists in the \"list of subscriber data\":

a\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the SNPN.

If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS
data off UE status in the Extended protocol configuration options IE
during UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure except for the
transfer of a PDU session from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access and except
for the establishment of user plane resources on the other access for
the MA PDU session(see subclause 6.4.1), and during UE-requested PDU
session modification procedure (see subclause 6.4.2), regardless of
associated access type of the PDU session. If the UE requests a PDU
session establishment procedure in order to transfer a PDU session from
non-3GPP access to 3GPP access, or in order to establish user plane
resources on the other access for the MA PDU session over 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access, and:

a\) if the 3GPP PS data off UE status has changed since the last
providing to the network, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS data off UE
status in the Extended protocol configuration options IE; or

b\) if the 3GPP PS data off UE status has not changed since the last
providing to the network, the UE need not provide the 3GPP PS data off
UE status.

The network shall support of 3GPP PS data off.

The UE shall indicate change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status for the
PDU session by using the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure
as specified in subclause 6.4.2.

When the 3GPP PS data off UE status is \"activated\":

a\) the UE does not send uplink IP packets via 3GPP access except:

1\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] when the UE is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN or for those
services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be
used in the SNPN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] when the UE is in
an SNPN;

2\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN,
if only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the
HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured to the UE as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\];

3\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the VPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN, if the
list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is
configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\];

4\) for those services indicated in the EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ USIM file as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\];

5\) any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\]; and

6\) any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.623 \[20\];

b\) the UE does not send uplink Ethernet user data packets via 3GPP
access; and

c\) the UE does not send uplink Unstructured user data packets via 3GPP
access.

Otherwise the UE sends uplink user data packets without restriction.

NOTE: If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, uplink IP packets are
filtered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\] in U.3.1.5.

3GPP PS data off does not restrict sending of uplink user data packets
via non-3GPP access of a single access PDU session or an MA PDU session.

\[TS 24.229, Rel-15, clause 4.17\]

The UE and the network can support the 3GPP PS data off.

When 3GPP PS data off is supported and active, IP packets that are
associated with services that are not a 3GPP PS data off exempt service
are prevented from transport over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS IP-CAN
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 \[7\]. The UE may be configured by the
HPLMN or the EHPLMN with up to two indications whether a 3GPP IMS
service is a 3GPP PS Data Off exempt service, one indication is valid
for the UE is in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN and the other indication is
valid for the UE is in the VPLMN. When the UE is only configured with
the indication valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the
UE shall use this indication also when the UE is in the VPLMN.

When 3GPP PS data off is supported and active and the UE is configured,
either as specified in 3GPP TS 24.167 \[8G\] or in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[15C\], with services that are 3GPP PS data off exempt,
then the UE will not send uplink IP packets related to any services that
are not 3GPP PS data off exempt over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS
IP-CAN. The UE informs the network about its 3GPP PS data off status by
including a g.3gpp.ps-data-off media feature tag specified in
subclause 7.9.8 in all REGISTER requests sent over GPRS IP-CAN, EPS
IP-CAN or 5GS IP-CAN. The UE reregisters over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN
and 5GS IP-CAN every time the 3GPP PS data off status is changed or the
UE is provided by the network with a new list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services while the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\".

An AS handling a service is configured with information whether the
service is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service. If the 3GPP PS data off
status is active and the service is not a 3GPP PS data off exempt
service, the AS prevents downlink IP packets of the service from
reaching the UE over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS IP-CAN. The AS
shall be configured with up to two indications whether a 3GPP IMS
service is a 3GPP PS Data Off exempt service, one indication is valid
for non-roaming users, and the other indication is valid for users
roaming in the various VPLMNs with whom roaming agreements exist. When
the AS is only configured with the indication valid for the UE camping
in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the AS shall use this indication also when
the UE is in the VPLMN.

\[TS 24.229, Rel-15, clause U.3.1.0\]

If the UE supports the 3GPP PS data off, then the UE shall in all
REGISTER requests include the \"+g.3gpp.ps-data-off\" header field
parameter defined in subclause 7.9.8 set to a value indicating the 3GPP
PS data off status.

When the UE sends a REGISTER request, if the 3GPP PS data off status is
\"active\", then the UE shall only include media feature tags associated
with services that are 3GPP PS data off exempt services in the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag, as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and
RFC 3840 \[62\], for the IMS communication services it intends to use.

If the UE is registered, and the 3GPP PS data off status is changed,
then the UE shall perform a reregistration of the previously registered
public user identity.

##### 11.6.2.2 Conformance Requirements {#conformance-requirements-61 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.2.10. TS 24.229 \[44\] clause 4.17,
Rel-15. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.2.10\]

In case of PLMN, a UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), can be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS
data off exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] or in the
EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ USIM file as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]:

a\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN
or EHPLMN; and

b\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN.

If only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the
HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured at the UE, this list shall be also used in
the VPLMN.

In case of SNPN, a UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), can be configured with a list of 3GPP PS data off
exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] for each SNPN
whose entry exists in the \"list of subscriber data\":

a\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the SNPN.

If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS
data off UE status in the Extended protocol configuration options IE
during UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure except for the
transfer of a PDU session from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access and except
for the establishment of user plane resources on the other access for
the MA PDU session(see subclause 6.4.1), and during UE-requested PDU
session modification procedure (see subclause 6.4.2), regardless of
associated access type of the PDU session. If the UE requests a PDU
session establishment procedure in order to transfer a PDU session from
non-3GPP access to 3GPP access, or in order to establish user plane
resources on the other access for the MA PDU session over 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access, and:

a\) if the 3GPP PS data off UE status has changed since the last
providing to the network, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS data off UE
status in the Extended protocol configuration options IE; or

b\) if the 3GPP PS data off UE status has not changed since the last
providing to the network, the UE need not provide the 3GPP PS data off
UE status.

The network shall support of 3GPP PS data off.

The UE shall indicate change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status for the
PDU session by using the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure
as specified in subclause 6.4.2.

When the 3GPP PS data off UE status is \"activated\":

a\) the UE does not send uplink IP packets via 3GPP access except:

1\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] when the UE is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN or for those
services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be
used in the SNPN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] when the UE is in
an SNPN;

2\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN,
if only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the
HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured to the UE as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\];

3\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the VPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN, if the
list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is
configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\];

4\) for those services indicated in the EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ USIM file as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\];

5\) any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\]; and

6\) any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.623 \[20\];

b\) the UE does not send uplink Ethernet user data packets via 3GPP
access; and

c\) the UE does not send uplink Unstructured user data packets via 3GPP
access.

Otherwise the UE sends uplink user data packets without restriction.

NOTE: If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, uplink IP packets are
filtered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\] in U.3.1.5.

3GPP PS data off does not restrict sending of uplink user data packets
via non-3GPP access of a single access PDU session or an MA PDU session.

\[TS 24.229, Rel-15, clause 4.17\]

The UE and the network can support the 3GPP PS data off.

When 3GPP PS data off is supported and active, IP packets that are
associated with services that are not a 3GPP PS data off exempt service
are prevented from transport over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS IP-CAN
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 \[7\]. The UE may be configured by the
HPLMN or the EHPLMN with up to two indications whether a 3GPP IMS
service is a 3GPP PS Data Off exempt service, one indication is valid
for the UE is in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN and the other indication is
valid for the UE is in the VPLMN. When the UE is only configured with
the indication valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the
UE shall use this indication also when the UE is in the VPLMN.

When 3GPP PS data off is supported and active and the UE is configured,
either as specified in 3GPP TS 24.167 \[8G\] or in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[15C\], with services that are 3GPP PS data off exempt,
then the UE will not send uplink IP packets related to any services that
are not 3GPP PS data off exempt over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS
IP-CAN. The UE informs the network about its 3GPP PS data off status by
including a g.3gpp.ps-data-off media feature tag specified in
subclause 7.9.8 in all REGISTER requests sent over GPRS IP-CAN, EPS
IP-CAN or 5GS IP-CAN. The UE reregisters over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN
and 5GS IP-CAN every time the 3GPP PS data off status is changed or the
UE is provided by the network with a new list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services while the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\".

An AS handling a service is configured with information whether the
service is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service. If the 3GPP PS data off
status is active and the service is not a 3GPP PS data off exempt
service, the AS prevents downlink IP packets of the service from
reaching the UE over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS IP-CAN. The AS
shall be configured with up to two indications whether a 3GPP IMS
service is a 3GPP PS Data Off exempt service, one indication is valid
for non-roaming users, and the other indication is valid for users
roaming in the various VPLMNs with whom roaming agreements exist. When
the AS is only configured with the indication valid for the UE camping
in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the AS shall use this indication also when
the UE is in the VPLMN.

\[TS 24.229, Rel-15, clause U.3.1.0\]

If the UE supports the 3GPP PS data off, then the UE shall in all
REGISTER requests include the \"+g.3gpp.ps-data-off\" header field
parameter defined in subclause 7.9.8 set to a value indicating the 3GPP
PS data off status.

When the UE sends a REGISTER request, if the 3GPP PS data off status is
\"active\", then the UE shall only include media feature tags associated
with services that are 3GPP PS data off exempt services in the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag, as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and
RFC 3840 \[62\], for the IMS communication services it intends to use.

If the UE is registered, and the 3GPP PS data off status is changed,
then the UE shall perform a reregistration of the previously registered
public user identity.

##### 11.6.3.2 Conformance Requirements {#conformance-requirements-62 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.2.10. TS 24.341, clause 5.3.1.2,
5.3.1.3 and TS 24.229 \[44\] clause 4.17, Rel-15. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.341, clause 5.3.1.2\]:

When an SM-over-IP sender wants to submit an SM over IP, the SM-over-IP
sender shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the following information:

a\) the Request-URI, which shall contain the PSI of the SC of the
SM-over-IP sender;

NOTE 1: The PSI of the SC can be SIP URI or tel URI based on operator
policy. The PSI of the SC can be obtained using one of the following
methods in the priority order listed below:

1\) provided by the user;

2\) if UICC is used, then:

\- if present in the ISIM, then the PSI of the SC is obtained from the
EF~PSISMSC~ in DF\_TELECOM of the ISIM as per 3GPP TS 31.103 \[18\];

\- if not present on the ISIM, then the PSI of the SC is obtained from
the EF~PSISMSC~ in DF\_TELECOM of the USIM as per 3GPP TS 31.102 \[19\];
or

\- if neither present on the ISIM nor on the USIM, then the PSI of the
SC contains the ***TS‑Service-Centre-Address*** stored in the EF~SMSP~
in DF\_TELECOM as per 3GPP TS 31.102 \[19\]. If the PSI of the SC is
based on the E.164 number from the ***TS‑Service-Centre-Address***
stored in the EF~SMSP~ in DF\_TELECOM then the URI constructed can be
either a tel URI or a SIP URI (using the \"user=phone\" SIP URI
parameter format).

3\) if SIM is used instead of UICC, then the PSI of the SC contains the
***TS‑Service Centre Address*** stored in the EF~SMSP~ in DF\_TELECOM as
per 3GPP TS 51.011 \[20\]. If the PSI of the SC is based on the E.164
number from the ***TS‑Service-Centre-Address*** stored in the EF~SMSP~
in DF\_TELECOM then the URI constructed can be either a tel URI or a SIP
URI (using the \"user=phone\" SIP URI parameter format); or

4\) if neither the UICC nor SIM is used, then how the PSI of the SC is
configured and obtained is through means outside the scope of this
specification.

b\) the From header, which shall contain a public user identity of the
SM-over-IP sender;

NOTE 2: The IP-SM-GW will have to use an address of the SM-over-IP
sender that the SC can process (i.e. an E.164 number). This address will
come from a tel URI in a P-Asserted-Identity header (as defined in
RFC 3325 \[13\]) placed in the SIP MESSAGE request by the P-CSCF or
S-CSCF.

NOTE 3: The SM-over-IP sender has to store the Call-ID of the SIP
MESSAGE request, so it can associate the appropriate SIP MESSAGE request
including a submit report with it.

c\) the To header, which shall contain the SC of the SM-over-IP sender;

d\) the Content-Type header, which shall contain
\"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\"; and

e\) the body of the request shall contain an RP-DATA message as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.011 \[8\], including the SMS headers and the SMS user
information encoded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 \[3\].

NOTE 4: The address of the SC is included in the RP-DATA message
content. The address of the SC included in the RP-DATA message content
is stored in the EF~SMSP~ in DF\_TELECOM of the (U)SIM of the SM-over-IP
sender.

NOTE 5: The SM-over-IP sender will use content transfer encoding of type
\"binary\" for the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE
request.

NOTE 6: Both the address of the SC and the PSI of the SC can be
configured in the EF~PSISMSC~ in DF\_TELECOM of the USIM and ISIM
respectively using the USAT as per 3GPP TS 31.111 \[21\].

The SM-over-IP sender may request the SC to return the status of the
submitted message. The support of status report capabilities is optional
for the SC.

When a SIP MESSAGE request including a submit report in the
\"vnd.3gpp.sms\" payload is received, the SM-over-IP sender shall:

\- if SM-over-IP sender supports In-Reply-To header usage and the
In-Reply-To header indicates that the request corresponds to a short
message submitted by the SM-over-IP sender, generate a 200 (OK) SIP
response according to RFC 3428 \[14\].

if SM-over-IP sender supports In-Reply-To header usage and the
In-Reply-To header indicates that the request does not correspond to a
short message submitted by the SM-over-IP sender, a 488 (Not Acceptable
here) SIP response according to RFC 3428 \[14\].

\- if SM-over-IP sender does not support In-Reply-To header usage,
generate a 200 (OK) SIP response according to RFC 3428 \[14\]; and
extract the payload encoded according to 3GPP TS 24.011 \[8\] for RP-ACK
or RP-ERROR.

\[TS 24.341 clause 5.3.1.3\]:

When a SIP MESSAGE request including a status report in the
\"vnd.3gpp.sms\" payload is delivered, the SM-over-IP sender shall:

\- generate a SIP response according to RFC 3428 \[14\];

\- extract the payload encoded according to 3GPP TS 24.011 \[8\] for
RP-DATA; and

\- create a delivery report for the status report as described in
subclause 5.3.2.4. The content of the delivery report is defined in
3GPP TS 24.011 \[8\].

\[TS 24.341 clause 5.3.2.4\]:

When an SM-over-IP receiver wants to send an SM delivery report over IP,
the SM-over-IP receiver shall send a SIP MESSAGE request with the
following information:

a\) the Request-URI, which shall contain the IP-SM-GW;

NOTE 1: The address of the IP-SM-GW is received in the
P-Asserted-Identity header in the SIP MESSAGE request including the
delivered short message.

b\) the From header, which shall contain a public user identity of the
SM-over-IP receiver.

c\) the To header, which shall contain the IP-SM-GW;

b\) the Content-Type header shall contain \"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\";
and

c\) the body of the request shall contain the RP-ACK or RP-ERROR message
for the SM delivery report, as defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 \[8\].

NOTE 2: The SM-over-IP sender will use content transfer encoding of type
\"binary\" for the encoding of the SM in the body of the SIP MESSAGE
request.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.2.10\]

In case of PLMN, a UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), can be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS
data off exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] or in the
EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ USIM file as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]:

a\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN
or EHPLMN; and

b\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN.

If only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the
HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured at the UE, this list shall be also used in
the VPLMN.

In case of SNPN, a UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), can be configured with a list of 3GPP PS data off
exempt services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] for each SNPN
whose entry exists in the \"list of subscriber data\":

a\) a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the SNPN.

If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS
data off UE status in the Extended protocol configuration options IE
during UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure except for the
transfer of a PDU session from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access and except
for the establishment of user plane resources on the other access for
the MA PDU session(see subclause 6.4.1), and during UE-requested PDU
session modification procedure (see subclause 6.4.2), regardless of
associated access type of the PDU session. If the UE requests a PDU
session establishment procedure in order to transfer a PDU session from
non-3GPP access to 3GPP access, or in order to establish user plane
resources on the other access for the MA PDU session over 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access, and:

a\) if the 3GPP PS data off UE status has changed since the last
providing to the network, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS data off UE
status in the Extended protocol configuration options IE; or

b\) if the 3GPP PS data off UE status has not changed since the last
providing to the network, the UE need not provide the 3GPP PS data off
UE status.

The network shall support of 3GPP PS data off.

The UE shall indicate change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status for the
PDU session by using the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure
as specified in subclause 6.4.2.

When the 3GPP PS data off UE status is \"activated\":

a\) the UE does not send uplink IP packets via 3GPP access except:

1\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] when the UE is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN or for those
services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be
used in the SNPN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\] when the UE is in
an SNPN;

2\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN,
if only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the
HPLMN or EHPLMN is configured to the UE as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\];

3\) for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the VPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN, if the
list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is
configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 \[17\];

4\) for those services indicated in the EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ USIM file as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\];

5\) any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\]; and

6\) any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.623 \[20\];

b\) the UE does not send uplink Ethernet user data packets via 3GPP
access; and

c\) the UE does not send uplink Unstructured user data packets via 3GPP
access.

Otherwise the UE sends uplink user data packets without restriction.

NOTE: If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, uplink IP packets are
filtered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[14\] in U.3.1.5.

3GPP PS data off does not restrict sending of uplink user data packets
via non-3GPP access of a single access PDU session or an MA PDU session.

\[TS 24.229, Rel-15, clause 4.17\]

The UE and the network can support the 3GPP PS data off.

When 3GPP PS data off is supported and active, IP packets that are
associated with services that are not a 3GPP PS data off exempt service
are prevented from transport over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS IP-CAN
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 \[7\]. The UE may be configured by the
HPLMN or the EHPLMN with up to two indications whether a 3GPP IMS
service is a 3GPP PS Data Off exempt service, one indication is valid
for the UE is in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN and the other indication is
valid for the UE is in the VPLMN. When the UE is only configured with
the indication valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the
UE shall use this indication also when the UE is in the VPLMN.

When 3GPP PS data off is supported and active and the UE is configured,
either as specified in 3GPP TS 24.167 \[8G\] or in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[15C\], with services that are 3GPP PS data off exempt,
then the UE will not send uplink IP packets related to any services that
are not 3GPP PS data off exempt over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS
IP-CAN. The UE informs the network about its 3GPP PS data off status by
including a g.3gpp.ps-data-off media feature tag specified in
subclause 7.9.8 in all REGISTER requests sent over GPRS IP-CAN, EPS
IP-CAN or 5GS IP-CAN. The UE reregisters over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN
and 5GS IP-CAN every time the 3GPP PS data off status is changed or the
UE is provided by the network with a new list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services while the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\".

An AS handling a service is configured with information whether the
service is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service. If the 3GPP PS data off
status is active and the service is not a 3GPP PS data off exempt
service, the AS prevents downlink IP packets of the service from
reaching the UE over EPS IP-CAN, GPRS IP-CAN and 5GS IP-CAN. The AS
shall be configured with up to two indications whether a 3GPP IMS
service is a 3GPP PS Data Off exempt service, one indication is valid
for non-roaming users, and the other indication is valid for users
roaming in the various VPLMNs with whom roaming agreements exist. When
the AS is only configured with the indication valid for the UE camping
in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the AS shall use this indication also when
the UE is in the VPLMN.

\[TS 24.229, Rel-15, clause U.3.1.0\]

If the UE supports the 3GPP PS data off, then the UE shall in all
REGISTER requests include the \"+g.3gpp.ps-data-off\" header field
parameter defined in subclause 7.9.8 set to a value indicating the 3GPP
PS data off status.

When the UE sends a REGISTER request, if the 3GPP PS data off status is
\"active\", then the UE shall only include media feature tags associated
with services that are 3GPP PS data off exempt services in the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag, as defined in subclause 7.9.2 and
RFC 3840 \[62\], for the IMS communication services it intends to use.

If the UE is registered, and the 3GPP PS data off status is changed,
then the UE shall perform a reregistration of the previously registered
public user identity.

##### 11.7.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-63 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.3.16, TS 38.304 clause 7.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.3.16\]

Extended DRX (eDRX) cycle is supported for a UE in N1 mode. When eDRX is
requested by the UE and accepted by the network:

\- if the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in
5GMM-IDLE mode or in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication;
or

\- if the UE is in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE
mode.

The UE may request the use of eDRX cycle during a registration procedure
by including the Requested extended DRX parameters IE (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\]). The UE shall not request
the use of eDRX during a registration procedure for emergency services.
The UE may use the extended idle mode DRX cycle length stored in the
USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]) when requesting the use of eDRX.

The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a
registration procedure when the UE has an emergency PDU session.

The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the
Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the registration
procedure. The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the Negotiated
extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure and
the UE does not have an emergency PDU session.

NOTE: If the UE wants to keep using eDRX, the UE includes the Extended
DRX parameters IE in each registration procedure.

If the UE received the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the
last registration procedure, upon successful completion of the PDU
session release procedure of the emergency PDU session, the UE shall
resume eDRX.

If the network has provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE
during the last registration procedure, upon successful completion of
the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU session, the
network shall resume eDRX.

If the UE or the network locally releases an emergency PDU session, the
UE or the network shall not use eDRX until the UE receives eDRX
parameters during a registration procedure with PDU session context
synchronization or upon successful completion of a service request
procedure with PDU session context synchronization.

If the UE did not receive the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE, or
if the UE has an emergency PDU session, the UE shall use the stored UE
specific DRX parameter, if available.

If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX, or if the UE has
an emergency PDU session, the network shall use the stored UE specific
DRX parameter, if available.

If the network provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE and
also assigned a new 5G-GUTI for the UE as described in
subclause 5.5.1.3.4 during the last registration procedure, the network
shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available, with the
old 5G-GUTI and use the eDRX provided by the network with the new
5G-GUTI until the old 5G-GUTI can be considered as invalid by the
network (see subclauses 5.4.4.4 and 5.5.1.3.4).

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.4\]

The UE may be configured by upper layers and/or RRC with an extended DRX
(eDRX) cycle T~eDRX,\ CN~ and/or T~eDRX,\ RAN~. The UE operates in eDRX
for CN paging in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE states if the UE is
configured for eDRX by upper layers and *eDRX-AllowedIdle* is signalled
in SIB1. The UE operates in eDRX for RAN paging in RRC\_INACTIVE state
if the UE is configured for eDRX by RAN and *eDRX-Allowed*I*nactive* is
signalled in SIB1. If the UE is configured with an extended DRX cycle no
longer than 1024 radio frames, it monitors POs as defined in 7.1 with
configured eDRX cycle. Otherwise, a UE configured with eDRX monitors POs
as defined in 7.1 during a periodic Paging Time Window (PTW) configured
for the UE. The PTW is UE-specific and is determined by a Paging
Hyperframe (PH), a starting position within the PH (PTW\_start) and an
ending position (PTW\_end). PH, PTW\_start and PTW\_end are given by the
following formula:

The PH for CN is the H-SFN satisfying the following equations:

H-SFN mod T~eDRX\_CN~= (UE\_ID\_H mod T~eDRX\_CN~), where

\- UE\_ID\_H: 13 most significant bits of the Hashed ID.

\- T~eDRX\_CN~: UE-specific eDRX cycle in Hyper-frames, (T~eDRX\_CN~ =
2, ..., 1024 Hyper-frames) configured by upper layers.

> PTW\_start denotes the first radio frame of the PH that is part of the
> PTW and has SFN satisfying the following equation:

SFN = 128 \* i~eDRX\_CN~, where

\- i~eDRX\_CN~ = floor(UE\_ID\_H /T~eDRX\_CN~) mod 8

PTW\_end is the last radio frame of the PTW and has SFN satisfying the
following equation:

SFN = (PTW\_start + L\*100 - 1) mod 1024, where

\- L = Paging Time Window (PTW) length (in seconds) configured by upper
layers

Hashed ID is defined as follows:

Hashed\_ID is Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for the bits b31, b30..., b0 of
5G-S-TMSI.

5G-S-TMSI = \<b47, b46, ..., b0\> as defined in TS 23.003 \[23\].

The 32-bit FCS shall be the ones complement of the sum (modulo 2) of Y1
and Y2, where

\- Y1 is the remainder of x^k^ (x^31^ + x^30^ + x^29^ + x^28^ + x^27^ +
x^26^ + x^25^ + x^24^ + x^23^ + x^22^ + x^21^ + x^20^ + x^19^ + x^18^ +
x^17^ + x^16^ + x^15^ + x^14^ + x^13^ + x^12^ + x^11^ + x^10^ + x^9^ +
x^8^ + x^7^ + x^6^ + x^5^ + x^4^ + x^3^ + x^2^ + x^1^ + 1) divided
(modulo 2) by the generator polynomial x^32^ + x^26^ + x^23^ + x^22^ +
x^16^ + x^12^ + x^11^ + x^10^ + x^8^ + x^7^ + x^5^ + x^4^ + x^2^ + x +
1, where k is 32; and

\- Y2 is the remainder of Y3 divided (modulo 2) by the generator
polynomial x^32^ + x^26^ + x^23^ + x^22^ + x^16^ + x^12^ + x^11^ + x^10^
+ x^8^ + x^7^ + x^5^ + x^4^ + x^2^ + x + 1, where Y3 is the product of
x^32^ by \"b31, b30..., b0 of S-TMSI or 5G-S-TMSI\", i.e., Y3 is the
generator polynomial x^32^ (b31\*x^31^ + b30\*x^30^ + ... + b0\*1).

NOTE: The Y1 is 0xC704DD7B for any 5G-S-TMSI value. An example of hashed
ID calculation is in Annex A.

##### 11.7.2.2 Conformance Requirements {#conformance-requirements-64 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.3.16 and TS 38.304, clause 7.1. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.3.16\]

Extended DRX (eDRX) cycle is supported for a UE in N1 mode. When eDRX is
requested by the UE and accepted by the network:

\- if the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in
5GMM-IDLE mode or in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication;
or

\- if the UE is in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE
mode.

The UE may request the use of eDRX cycle during a registration procedure
by including the Requested extended DRX parameters IE (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\]). The UE shall not request
the use of eDRX during a registration procedure for emergency services.
The UE may use the extended idle mode DRX cycle length stored in the
USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]) when requesting the use of eDRX.

The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a
registration procedure when the UE has an emergency PDU session.

The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the
Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the registration
procedure. The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the Negotiated
extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure and
the UE does not have an emergency PDU session.

NOTE: If the UE wants to keep using eDRX, the UE includes the Extended
DRX parameters IE in each registration procedure.

If the UE received the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the
last registration procedure, upon successful completion of the PDU
session release procedure of the emergency PDU session, the UE shall
resume eDRX.

If the network has provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE
during the last registration procedure, upon successful completion of
the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU session, the
network shall resume eDRX.

If the UE or the network locally releases an emergency PDU session, the
UE or the network shall not use eDRX until the UE receives eDRX
parameters during a registration procedure with PDU session context
synchronization or upon successful completion of a service request
procedure with PDU session context synchronization.

If the UE did not receive the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE, or
if the UE has an emergency PDU session, the UE shall use the stored UE
specific DRX parameter, if available.

If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX, or if the UE has
an emergency PDU session, the network shall use the stored UE specific
DRX parameter, if available.

If the network provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE and
also assigned a new 5G-GUTI for the UE as described in
subclause 5.5.1.3.4 during the last registration procedure, the network
shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available, with the
old 5G-GUTI and use the eDRX provided by the network with the new
5G-GUTI until the old 5G-GUTI can be considered as invalid by the
network (see subclauses 5.4.4.4 and 5.5.1.3.4).

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.1\]

In RRC\_INACTIVE state, if eDRX is configured by RRC, i.e.,
T~eDRX,\ RAN~ , and/or upper layers, i.e., T~eDRX,\ CN~, as defined in
clause 7.4:

\- If both T~eDRX,\ CN~ and T~eDRX,\ RAN~ are no longer than 1024 radio
frames, T = min{T~eDRX,\ RAN~, T~eDRX,\ CN~}.

\- If T~eDRX,\ CN~ is no longer than 1024 radio frames and no
T~eDRX,\ RAN~ is configured, T is determined by the shortest of UE
specific DRX value configured by RRC and T~eDRX,\ CN~.

##### 11.7.3.2 Conformance Requirements {#conformance-requirements-65 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.3.16 and TS 38.304, clause 7.1 and
clause 7.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.3.16\]

Extended DRX (eDRX) cycle is supported for a UE in N1 mode. When eDRX is
requested by the UE and accepted by the network:

\- if the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in
5GMM-IDLE mode or in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication;
or

\- if the UE is in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE
mode.

The UE may request the use of eDRX cycle during a registration procedure
by including the Requested extended DRX parameters IE (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\]). The UE shall not request
the use of eDRX during a registration procedure for emergency services.
The UE may use the extended idle mode DRX cycle length stored in the
USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 \[22\]) when requesting the use of eDRX.

The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a
registration procedure when the UE has an emergency PDU session.

The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the
Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the registration
procedure. The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the Negotiated
extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure and
the UE does not have an emergency PDU session.

NOTE: If the UE wants to keep using eDRX, the UE includes the Extended
DRX parameters IE in each registration procedure.

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.1\]

The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in RRC\_IDLE and
RRC\_INACTIVE state in order to reduce power consumption. The UE
monitors one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle. A PO is a set of PDCCH
monitoring occasions and can consist of multiple time slots (e.g.
subframe or OFDM symbol) where paging DCI can be sent (TS 38.213 \[4\]).
One Paging Frame (PF) is one Radio Frame and may contain one or multiple
PO(s) or starting point of a PO. A L2 U2N Relay UE monitors the paging
occasions of its PC5-RRC connected L2 U2N Remote UEs. In this case, the
DRX cycle and UE ID mentioned in this clause refer to those of the L2
U2N Remote UE.

In multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the same paging message
and the same Short Message are repeated in all transmitted beams and
thus the selection of the beam(s) for the reception of the paging
message and Short Message is up to UE implementation. The paging message
is same for both RAN initiated paging and CN initiated paging.

The UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN
initiated paging. If the UE receives a CN initiated paging in
RRC\_INACTIVE state, the UE moves to RRC\_IDLE and informs NAS. However,
if a L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state receives a CN initiated
paging for a L2 U2N Remote UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE does not move to
RRC\_IDLE state.

NOTE 0a: The L2 U2N Remote UE does not need to monitor the PO in order
to receive the paging message.

NOTE 0b: While the SDT procedure is ongoing in RRC\_INACTIVE state, the
UE monitors the PO in order to receive only the Short Message as
specified in TS 38.331 \[3\].

The PF and PO for paging are determined by the following formulae:

SFN for the PF is determined by:

(SFN + PF\_offset) mod T = (T div N)\*(UE\_ID mod N)

Index (i\_s), indicating the index of the PO is determined by:

i\_s = floor (UE\_ID/N) mod Ns

The PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are determined according to
*pagingSearchSpace* as specified in TS 38.213 \[4\] and
*firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* and
*nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO* if configured as specified in
TS 38.331 \[3\]. When *SearchSpaceId* = 0 is configured for
*pagingSearchSpace*, the PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are same
as for RMSI as defined in clause 13 in TS 38.213 \[4\].

When *SearchSpaceId* = 0 is configured for *pagingSearchSpace***, Ns is
either 1 or 2. For Ns = 1, there is only one PO which starts from the
first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the PF. For Ns = 2, PO is
either in the first half frame (i\_s = 0) or the second half frame (i\_s
= 1) of the PF.**

When *SearchSpaceId* other than 0 is configured for *pagingSearchSpace,*
the UE monitors the (i\_s + 1)^th^ PO. A PO is a set of \'S\*X \'
consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions where \'S\' is the number of
actual transmitted SSBs determined according to *ssb-PositionsInBurst*
in *SIB1* and X is the *nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO* if
configured or is equal to 1 otherwise. The \[x\*S+K\]^th^ PDCCH
monitoring occasion for paging in the PO corresponds to the K^th^
transmitted SSB, where x=0,1,...,X-1, K=1,2,...,S. The PDCCH monitoring
occasions for paging which do not overlap with UL symbols (determined
according to *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*) are sequentially numbered
from zero starting from the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging
in the PF. When *firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* is present, the
starting PDCCH monitoring occasion number of (i\_s + 1)^th^ PO is the
(i\_s + 1)^th^ value of the *firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO*
parameter; otherwise, it is equal to i\_s \* S\*X. If X \> 1, when the
UE detects a PDCCH transmission addressed to P-RNTI within its PO, the
UE is not required to monitor the subsequent PDCCH monitoring occasions
for this PO.

NOTE 1: A PO associated with a PF may start in the PF or after the PF.

NOTE 2: The PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span multiple radio
frames. When *SearchSpaceId* other than 0 is configured for
*paging-SearchSpace* the PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span
multiple periods of the paging search space.

The following parameters are used for the calculation of PF and i\_s
above:

**T: DRX cycle of the UE.**

If the UE does not operate in eDRX as defined in clause 7.4:

**-** T is determined by the shortest of the UE specific DRX value(s),
if configured by RRC and/or upper layers or provided in PC5-RRC
signalling in case of a L2 U2N Relay UE, and a default DRX value
broadcast in system information. In RRC\_IDLE state, if UE specific DRX
is not configured by upper layers, the default value is applied.

In RRC\_INACTIVE state, if eDRX is configured by RRC, i.e.,
T~eDRX,\ RAN~ , and/or upper layers, i.e., T~eDRX,\ CN~, as defined in
clause 7.4:

\- If both T~eDRX,\ CN~ and T~eDRX,\ RAN~ are no longer than 1024 radio
frames, T = min{T~eDRX,\ RAN~, T~eDRX,\ CN~}.

\- If T~eDRX,\ CN~ is no longer than 1024 radio frames and no
T~eDRX,\ RAN~ is configured, T is determined by the shortest of UE
specific DRX value configured by RRC and T~eDRX,\ CN~.

\- If T~eDRX,\ CN~ is longer than 1024 radio frames:

\- If T~eDRX,\ RAN~ is not configured or used:

\- During CN configured PTW, T is determined by the shortest of the UE
specific DRX value (s), if configured by RRC and/or upper layers, and a
default DRX value broadcast in system information. Outside the CN
configured PTW, T is determined by the UE specific DRX value configured
by RRC;

\- else if used T~eDRX,\ RAN~ is no longer than 1024 radio frames:

\- During CN configured PTW, T is determined by the shortest of the UE
specific DRX value, if configured by upper layers and T~eDRX,\ RAN~, and
a default DRX value broadcast in system information. Outside the CN
configured PTW, T is determined by T~eDRX,\ RAN~.

**N: number of total paging frames in T**

Ns: number of paging **occasions** for a PF

PF\_offset: offset used for PF determination

**UE\_ID:**

If the UE operates in eDRX as specified in clause 7.4:

\- 5G-S-TMSI mod 4096

else:

\- 5G-S-TMSI mod 1024

Parameters *Ns*, *nAndPagingFrameOffset*,
*nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO*, and the length of default DRX
Cycle are signalled in *SIB1*. The values of N and PF\_offset are
derived from the parameter *nAndPagingFrameOffset* as defined in TS
38.331 \[3\]. The parameter *firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* is
signalled in *SIB1* for paging in the BWP configured by
*initialDownlinkBWP*. For paging in a DL BWP other than the BWP
configured by *initialDownlinkBWP*, the parameter
*first-PDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO* is signaled in the corresponding
BWP configuration.

If the UE has no 5G-S-TMSI, for instance when the UE has not yet
registered onto the network, the UE shall use as default identity UE\_ID
= 0 in the PF and i\_s formulas above.

5G-S-TMSI is a 48 bit long bit string as defined in TS 23.501 \[10\].
5G-S-TMSI shall in the formulae above be interpreted as a binary number
where the left most bit represents the most significant bit.

**In** RRC\_INACTIVE **state, if the** UE supports
*inactiveStatePO-Determination* and the network broadcasts
*ranPagingInIdlePO* with value \"true\", the UE shall use the same i\_s
as for RRC\_IDLE state. Otherwise, the UE determines the i\_s based on
the parameters and formula above.

In RRC\_INACTIVE state, if used eDRX value configured by upper layers is
no longer than 1024 radio frames, the UE shall use the same i\_s as for
RRC\_IDLE state.

In RRC\_INACTIVE state, if used eDRX value configured by upper layers is
longer than 1024 radio frames, during CN PTW, the UE shall use the same
i\_s as for RRC\_IDLE state. Outside CN PTW, the UE shall use the i\_s
for RRC\_INACTIVE state.

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.4\]

The UE may be configured by upper layers and/or RRC with an extended DRX
(eDRX) cycle T~eDRX,\ CN~ and/or T~eDRX,\ RAN~. The UE operates in eDRX
for CN paging in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE states if the UE is
configured for eDRX by upper layers and *eDRX-AllowedIdle* is signalled
in SIB1. The UE operates in eDRX for RAN paging in RRC\_INACTIVE state
if the UE is configured for eDRX by RAN and *eDRX-Allowed*I*nactive* is
signalled in SIB1. If the UE operates in eDRX with an eDRX cycle no
longer than 1024 radio frames, it monitors POs as defined in 7.1 with
configured eDRX cycle. Otherwise, a UE operating in eDRX monitors POs as
defined in 7.1 during a periodic Paging Time Window (PTW) configured for
the UE. The PTW is UE-specific and is determined by a Paging Hyperframe
(PH), a starting position within the PH (PTW\_start) and an ending
position (PTW\_end). PH, PTW\_start and PTW\_end are given by the
following formula:

The PH for CN is the H-SFN satisfying the following equations:

H-SFN mod T~eDRX\_CN~= (UE\_ID\_H mod T~eDRX\_CN~), where

\- UE\_ID\_H: 13 most significant bits of the Hashed ID.

\- T~eDRX\_CN~: UE-specific eDRX cycle in Hyper-frames, (T~eDRX\_CN~ =
2, ..., 1024 Hyper-frames) configured by upper layers.

> PTW\_start denotes the first radio frame of the PH that is part of the
> PTW and has SFN satisfying the following equation:

SFN = 128 \* i~eDRX\_CN~, where

\- i~eDRX\_CN~ = floor(UE\_ID\_H /T~eDRX\_CN~) mod 8

PTW\_end is the last radio frame of the PTW and has SFN satisfying the
following equation:

SFN = (PTW\_start + L\*100 - 1) mod 1024, where

\- L = Paging Time Window (PTW) length (in seconds) configured by upper
layers

Hashed ID is defined as follows:

Hashed\_ID is Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for the bits b31, b30..., b0 of
5G-S-TMSI.

5G-S-TMSI = \<b47, b46, ..., b0\> as defined in TS 23.003 \[23\].

The 32-bit FCS shall be the ones complement of the sum (modulo 2) of Y1
and Y2, where

\- Y1 is the remainder of x^k^ (x^31^ + x^30^ + x^29^ + x^28^ + x^27^ +
x^26^ + x^25^ + x^24^ + x^23^ + x^22^ + x^21^ + x^20^ + x^19^ + x^18^ +
x^17^ + x^16^ + x^15^ + x^14^ + x^13^ + x^12^ + x^11^ + x^10^ + x^9^ +
x^8^ + x^7^ + x^6^ + x^5^ + x^4^ + x^3^ + x^2^ + x^1^ + 1) divided
(modulo 2) by the generator polynomial x^32^ + x^26^ + x^23^ + x^22^ +
x^16^ + x^12^ + x^11^ + x^10^ + x^8^ + x^7^ + x^5^ + x^4^ + x^2^ + x +
1, where k is 32; and

\- Y2 is the remainder of Y3 divided (modulo 2) by the generator
polynomial x^32^ + x^26^ + x^23^ + x^22^ + x^16^ + x^12^ + x^11^ + x^10^
+ x^8^ + x^7^ + x^5^ + x^4^ + x^2^ + x + 1, where Y3 is the product of
x^32^ by \"b31, b30..., b0 of S-TMSI or 5G-S-TMSI\", i.e., Y3 is the
generator polynomial x^32^ (b31\*x^31^ + b30\*x^30^ + ... + b0\*1).

NOTE: The Y1 is 0xC704DD7B for any 5G-S-TMSI value. An example of hashed
ID calculation is in Annex A.

##### 11.7.4.2 Conformance Requirements {#conformance-requirements-66 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331, clause 6.2.2 and TS 38.304, clause 7.1 and
clause 7.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-18 requirements.

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.1\]

The following parameters are used for the calculation of PF and i\_s
above:

**T: DRX cycle of the UE.**

...

In RRC\_INACTIVE state, if the UE operates in eDRX and eDRX is
configured by RRC, i.e., T~eDRX,\ RAN~ (if any), and upper layers, i.e.,
T~eDRX,\ CN~, as defined in clause 7.4:

....

\- If T~eDRX,\ CN~ is longer than 1024 radio frames:

...

\- else if used T~eDRX,\ RAN~ is longer than 1024 radio frames:

\- During the overlapped part of CN configured PTW and RAN configured
PTW, T is determined by the shortest of the UE specific DRX value
configured by RRC, the UE specific DRX value configured by upper layers
(if any), and a default DRX value broadcast in system information;

\- During CN configured PTW and outside RAN configured PTW, T is
determined by the shortest of the UE specific DRX value configured by
upper layers (if any), and a default DRX value broadcast in system
information;

\- Outside CN configured PTW and during RAN configured PTW, T is
determined by the UE specific DRX value configured by RRC.

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.4\]

If the UE operates in eDRX with an eDRX cycle no longer than 1024 radio
frames, it monitors POs as defined in 7.1 with configured eDRX cycle.
Otherwise, a UE operating in eDRX monitors POs as defined in 7.1 during
a periodic Paging Time Window (PTW) configured for the UE. The PTW is
UE-specific and is determined by a Paging Hyperframe (PH), a starting
position within the PH (PTW\_start) and an ending position (PTW\_end).
PH, PTW\_start and PTW\_end are given by the following formula:

The PH for CN is the H-SFN satisfying the following equations:

H-SFN mod T~eDRX,\ CN~= (UE\_ID\_H mod T~eDRX,\ CN~), where

\- T~eDRX,\ CN~: UE-specific eDRX cycle in Hyper-frames, (T~eDRX,\ CN~ =
2, ..., 1024 Hyper-frames) configured by upper layers.

The PH for RAN is the H-SFN satisfying the following equations:

H-SFN mod T~eDRX\_RAN~= (UE\_ID\_H mod T~eDRX\_RAN~), where

\- T~eDRX\_RAN~: UE-specific eDRX cycle in Hyper-frames, (T~eDRX\_RAN~ =
2, ..., 1024 Hyper-frames) configured by RRC.

For CN configured PTW:

PTW\_start denotes the first radio frame of the PH for CN that is part
of the PTW and has SFN satisfying the following equation:

SFN = 128 \* i~eDRX,\ CN~, where

\- i~eDRX,\ CN~ = floor(UE\_ID\_H /T~eDRX,\ CN~) mod 8

PTW\_end is the last radio frame of the PTW and has SFN satisfying the
following equation:

SFN = (PTW\_start + L\*100 - 1) mod 1024, where

\- L = Paging Time Window (PTW) length (in seconds) configured by upper
layers

For RAN configured PTW:

PTW\_start denotes the first radio frame of the PH for RAN that is part
of the PTW and has SFN satisfying the following equation:

SFN = 128 \* i~eDRX\_CN~, where

\- i~eDRX\_CN~ = floor(UE\_ID\_H /T~eDRX\_CN~) mod 8

PTW\_end is the last radio frame of the PTW and has SFN satisfying the
following equation:

SFN = (PTW\_start + L\*100 - 1) mod 1024, where

\- L = Paging Time Window (PTW) length (in seconds) configured by RRC

### 11.7.5 eDRX / Inactive / RAN-initiated paging / Correct using ran-ExtendedPagingCycleConfig-r18 and ran-ExtendedPagingCycle-r17

##### 11.7.5.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-68 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-162 .H6}

**with** { UE in NR RRC\_INACTIVE state and configured different eDRX in
ran-ExtendedPagingCycleConfig-r18 and ran-ExtendedPagingCycle-r17 }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE camps on a NR Cell with eDRX-AllowedInactive-r18
signalling in SIB1 , the network sends a RAN-initiated Paging message
within a paging occasion }

**then** { UE resumes RRC connection }

}

##### (2) {#section-163 .H6}

**with** { UE in NR RRC\_INACTIVE state and configured different eDRX in
ran-ExtendedPagingCycleConfig-r18 and ran-ExtendedPagingCycle-r17 }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE moves to another NR Cell with only
eDRX-AllowedInactive-r17 signalling in SIB1 , the network sends a
RAN-initiated Paging message within a paging occasion }

**then** { UE resumes RRC connection }

}

##### 11.7.5.2 Conformance Requirements {#conformance-requirements-67 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.331, clause 6.2.2 and TS 38.304, clause 7.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-18 requirements.

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.4\]

The UE may be configured by upper layers and/or RRC with an extended DRX
(eDRX) cycle T~eDRX,\ CN~ and/or T~eDRX,\ RAN~.

For CN paging, the UE operates in eDRX in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE
states if the UE is configured for eDRX by upper layers and
*eDRX-AllowedIdle* is signalled in SIB1; otherwise, the UE does not
operate in eDRX.

For RAN paging, the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state:

\- if the UE is configured for eDRX by
*ran-ExtendedPagingCycleConfig-r18* and *eDRX-AllowedInactive-r18* is
signalled in SIB1:

\- operates in eDRX with an eDRX cycle T~eDRX,\ RAN~ configured by
*extendedPagingCycle-r18*;

\- else if the UE is configured for eDRX by
*ran-ExtendedPagingCycle-r17* and *eDRX-AllowedInactive-r17* is
signalled in SIB1:

\- operates in eDRX with an eDRX cycle T~eDRX,\ RAN~ configured by
*ran-ExtendedPagingCycle-r17*;

\- else:

\- does not operate in eDRX.

| *The presence of eDRX-AllowedInactive-r17 indicates that extended    |

| in the cell for UEs in RRC\_INACTIVE. The UE shall stop using        |
| extended DRX cycle equal to or shorter than 10.24 s for RAN paging   |
| in RRC\_INACTIVE if eDRX-AllowedInactive-r17 is not present. The     |
| presence of eDRX-AllowedInactive-r18 indicates that extended DRX     |
| cycle longer than 10.24 s for RAN paging is allowed in the cell for  |
| UEs in RRC\_INACTIVE. The UE shall stop using extended DRX cycle     |
| longer than 10.24 s for RAN paging in RRC\_INACTIVE if               |
| eDRX-AllowedInactive-r18 is not present.*                            |

### 11.8.1 Inter-system mobility between untrusted Non-3GPP and 3GPP system/Handover from NR to N3IWF/5GC

##### 11.8.1.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-69 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-164 .H6}

**With** { UE supports N1 mode, the UE supports IP address preservation
between NR and N3IWF/5GS, at least one PDN Connections have been
established between the UE and 5GC, UE in state EMM-REGISTERED }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE detects NR becomes not suitable and performs a handover of
existing PDN connection from NR to N3IWF/5GC }

**then** { UE requested PDU Session Establishment with Existing PDU
Session indication in 5GC via Untrusted non-3GPP Access via N3IWF }

}

specified in: TS 23.502, clause 4.9.2.2

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.9.2.2\]

Clause 4.9.2.2 specifies how to hand over a UE from a source 3GPP access
to a target Untrusted non-3GPP access and how a UE can handover a PDU
Session from 3GPP access to untrusted non-3GPP access. It is based on
the PDU Session Establishment procedure for non-3GPP access as specified
in clause 4.12.5.

Figure 4.9.2.2-1: Handover of a PDU Session from 3GPP access to
untrusted non-3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)

1\. If the UE is not registered via untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE
shall initiate Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.12.2.

2\. The UE performs PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU
Session ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified in clause 4.12.5.

When sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the N1 SM
container and in the N2 SM information, the SMF shall include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS
Profile(s) in N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) that are applicable
to the PDU Session for the target access.

3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in 3GPP access,
the SMF executes the release of resource in 3GPP access by performing
step 3b, then steps 4 to 7a/7b specified in clause 4.3.4.2 (UE or
network requested PDU Session Release for Non-Roaming and Roaming with
Local Breakout) in order to release the resources over the source 3GPP
access. Because the PDU Session shall not be released, the SMF shall not
send the PDU Session Release Command to the UE. Hence, in steps 3b, 4, 6
and 7a of clause 4.3.4.2, messages do not include the N1 SM container
but only the N2 Resource Release Request (resp. Ack). Since the PDU
Session is not to be released, the SMF shall not execute step 11 of
clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM context between the AMF and the SMF is
maintained.

If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in 3GPP access, this
step is skipped.

The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved
from 3GPP access to untrusted non-3GPP access.

If the PDU Session is associated with Control Plane Only Indication, the
AMF shall reject the PDU Session establishment request as the Control
Plane CIoT Optimisation feature is not supported over non-3GPP accesses
as described in clause 5.4.5.2.5 of TS 24.501 \[25\].

##### 11.8.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-69 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 23.502, clause 4.9.2.1

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.9.2.1\]

Clause 4.9.2.1 specifies how to hand over a UE from a source Untrusted
non-3GPP access to a target 3GPP access and how a UE can handover a PDU
Session from untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access. It is based on
the PDU Session Establishment procedure for 3GPP access as specified in
clause 4.3.2.

![](./media/image9.png){width="6.104166666666667in"
height="1.3888888888888888in"}

Figure 4.9.2.1-1: Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted
non-3GPP access to 3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local
breakout)

1\. If the UE is not registered via 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate
Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2.

2\. The UE performs a PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU
Session ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified clause 4.3.2.2.1
(PDU Session Establishment for Non-roaming and Roaming with Local
Breakout).

When sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the N1 SM
container and in the N2 SM information, the SMF shall include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS
Profile(s) in N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) that are applicable
to the PDU Session for the target access.

3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in non-3GPP
access, the SMF executes the release of resources in non-3GPP access by
initiating a Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer (to send N2
resource release request) which triggers performing steps 4 to 7
specified in clause 4.12.7, followed by step 7a/7b specified in clause
4.3.4.2 in order to release the resources over the source non-3GPP
access. Because the PDU Session shall not be released, the SMF shall not
send the PDU Session Release Command to the UE. Hence, in steps 4 and 7
of clause 4.12.7 as well as in step 7a of clause 4.3.4.2, the messages
do not include the N1 SM container but only the N2 Resource Release
Request (resp. Ack). Since the PDU Session is not to be released, the
SMF shall not execute step 11 of clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM context
between the AMF and the SMF is maintained.

If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in non-3GPP access,
this step is skipped.

The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved
from to untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.

If the UE is moving to the NB-IoT RAT type of 3GPP access, the PDU
Session Establishment request would be rejected by AMF when the UP
resources exceeds the UE\'s maximum number of supported UP resources as
described in clause 5.4.5.2.4 of TS 24.501 \[25\].

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.9.2.2\]

##### 4.9.2.2 Handover of a PDU Session procedure from 3GPP to untrusted non-3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout) {#handover-of-a-pdu-session-procedure-from-3gpp-to-untrusted-non-3gpp-access-non-roaming-and-roaming-with-local-breakout .H6}

Clause 4.9.2.2 specifies how to hand over a UE from a source 3GPP access
to a target Untrusted non-3GPP access and how a UE can handover a PDU
Session from 3GPP access to untrusted non-3GPP access. It is based on
the PDU Session Establishment procedure for non-3GPP access as specified
in clause 4.12.5.

Figure 4.9.2.2-1: Handover of a PDU Session from 3GPP access to
untrusted non-3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local breakout)

1\. If the UE is not registered via untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE
shall initiate Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.12.2.

2\. The UE performs PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU
Session ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified in clause 4.12.5.

When sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the N1 SM
container and in the N2 SM information, the SMF shall include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS
Profile(s) in N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) that are applicable
to the PDU Session for the target access.

3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in 3GPP access,
the SMF executes the release of resource in 3GPP access by performing
step 3b, then steps 4 to 7a/7b specified in clause 4.3.4.2 (UE or
network requested PDU Session Release for Non-Roaming and Roaming with
Local Breakout) in order to release the resources over the source 3GPP
access. Because the PDU Session shall not be released, the SMF shall not
send the PDU Session Release Command to the UE. Hence, in steps 3b, 4, 6
and 7a of clause 4.3.4.2, messages do not include the N1 SM container
but only the N2 Resource Release Request (resp. Ack). Since the PDU
Session is not to be released, the SMF shall not execute step 11 of
clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM context between the AMF and the SMF is
maintained.

If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in 3GPP access, this
step is skipped.

The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved
from 3GPP access to untrusted non-3GPP access.

If the PDU Session is associated with Control Plane Only Indication, the
AMF shall reject the PDU Session establishment request as the Control
Plane CIoT Optimisation feature is not supported over non-3GPP accesses
as described in clause 5.4.5.2.5 of TS 24.501 \[25\].

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.11.2.3\]

The following procedure is used by UEs in single-registration mode on
mobility from EPS to 5GS.

In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID
according to clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 \[2\].

This procedure is also used by UEs in dual-registration mode to perform
registration in 5GS when the UE is also registered in EPC. The procedure
is the General Registration procedure as captured in clause 4.2.2.
Difference from that procedure are captured below.

The UE has one or more ongoing PDN connections including one or more EPS
bearers. During the PDN connection establishment, the UE allocates the
PDU Session ID and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO, as described in
clause 4.11.1.1.

Figure 4.11.2.3-1: Mobility procedure from EPS to 5GS without N26
interface

0\. The UE is attached in EPC as specified in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

1\. Step 1 in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration) with the following
clarifications:

The UE indicates that it is moving from EPC. The UE in single
registration mode provides the Registration type set to \"mobility
registration update\", a 5G-GUTI mapped from the 4G-GUTI and a native
5G-GUTI (if available) as an Additional GUTI. The UE includes the UE
Policy Container containing the list of PSIs, indication of UE support
for ANDSP and OSId if available. The UE shall select the 5G-GUTI for the
additional GUTI as follows, listed in decreasing order of preference:

\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN to which the UE is attempting
to register, if available;

\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by an equivalent PLMN to the PLMN to which
the UE is attempting to register, if available;

\- a native 5G-GUTI assigned by any other PLMN, if available.

The UE in dual registration mode provides the Registration type set to
\"initial registration\" and a native 5G-GUTI or SUCI. In single
registration mode, the UE also includes at least the S-NSSAIs (with
values for the Serving PLMN) associated with the established PDN
connections in the Requested NSSAI in RRC Connection Establishment.

2\. Step 2 as in clause 4.2.2.2.

3\. Step 3 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the
following modifications:

If the Registration type is \"mobility registration update\" and the UE
indicates that it is moving from EPC in step 1 and the AMF is configured
to support 5GS-EPS interworking procedure without N26 interface, the AMF
treats this registration request as \"initial Registration\" and the AMF
skips the PDU Session status synchronization.

NOTE 1: The UE operating in single registration mode includes the PDU
Session IDs corresponding to the PDN connections to the PDU Session
status.

If the UE has provided a 5G-GUTI mapped from 4G-GUTI in step 1 and the
AMF is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking procedure without N26
interface, the AMF does not perform steps 4 and 5 in clause 4.2.2.2 (UE
context transfer from the MME).

4\. Steps 4-13 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the
following modifications:

If the UE has included an additional GUTI in the Registration Request,
then the new AMF attempts to retrieve the UE\'s security context from
the old AMF in steps 4 and 5.

If the UE\'s security context is not available in the old AMF or if the
UE has not provided an additional GUTI then the AMF retrieves the SUCI
from the UE in steps 6 and 7.

5\. Step 14 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration), with the
following modifications:

If the UE indicates that it is moving from EPC and the Registration type
is set to \"initial registration\" or \"mobility registration update\"
in step 1 and AMF is configured to support 5GS-EPS interworking without
N26 procedure, the AMF sends an Nudm\_UECM\_Registration Request message
to the HSS+UDM indicating that registration of an MME at the HSS+UDM, if
any, shall not be cancelled. The HSS+UDM does not send cancel location
to the old MME.

NOTE 2: If the UE does not maintain registration in EPC, upon
reachability time-out, the MME can implicitly detach the UE and release
the possible remaining PDN connections in EPC.

The subscription profile the AMF receives from HSS+UDM includes the
DNN/APN and SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface for each PDN connection
established in EPC. For emergency PDU Session, the AMF receives
Emergency Information containing SMF+PGW-C FQDN from HSS+UDM.

6\. Steps 15-19c as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration).

7\. Step 21 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration) with the
following modifications:

The AMF includes an \"Interworking without N26\" indicator to the UE.

If the UE had provided PDU Session Status information in step 1, the AMF
Sets the PDU Session Status to not synchronized.

8\. Step 22 as in clause 4.2.2.2.2 (General Registration)

9\. UE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure as in
clause 4.3.2.2.1.

If the UE had setup PDN Connections in EPC which it wants to transfer to
5GS and maintain the same IP address/prefix and the UE received
\"Interworking without N26\" indicator in step 7, the UE performs the UE
requested PDU Session Establishment Procedure as in clause 4.3.2.2 and
sets the Request Type to \"Existing PDU Session\" or \"Existing
Emergency PDU Session\" in step 1 of the procedure. The UE provides a
DNN for non-emergency PDU Session, the PDU Session ID and S-NSSAI
corresponding to the existing PDN connection it wants to transfer from
EPS to 5GS. The S-NSSAI is set as described in clause 5.15.7.2 of
TS 23.501 \[2\].

If the Request Type indicates \"Existing Emergency PDU Session\", the
AMF shall use the Emergency Information received from the HSS+UDM which
contains SMF+PGW-C FQDN for S5/S8 interface for the emergency PDN
connection established in EPS and the AMF shall use the S-NSSAI locally
configured in Emergency Configuration Data.

UEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDN
connection immediately after the step 8. UEs in dual-registration mode
may perform this step any time after step 8. Also, UEs in
dual-registration mode may perform this step only for a subset of PDU
Sessions. The AMF determines the S5/S8 interface of the SMF+PGW-C for
the PDU Session based on the DNN received from the UE and the SMF+PGW-C
ID in the subscription profile received from the HSS+UDM in step 5 or
when the HSS+UDM notifies the AMF for the new SMF+PGW-C ID in the
updated subscription profile. The AMF queries the NRF in serving PLMN by
issuing the Nnrf\_NFDiscovery\_Request including the FQDN for the S5/S8
interface of the SMF+PGW-C and the NRF provides the IP address or FQDN
of the N11/N16 interface of the SMF+PGW-C. The AMF invokes the
Nsmf\_PDUSession\_CreateSMContext service with the SMF address provided
by the NRF. The AMF includes the PDU Session ID to the request sent to
the SMF+PGW-C.

The SMF+PGW-C uses the PDU Session ID to determine the correct PDU
Session.

After step 16a of Figure 4.3.2.2.1-1 in clause 4.3.2.2.1, user plane is
switched from EPS to 5GS.

As specified clause 4.3.2.2, if the SMF has not yet registered for the
PDU Session ID, then the SMF registers with the UDM using
Nudm\_UECM\_Registration (SUPI, DNN, PDU Session ID) and if Session
Management Subscription data for corresponding SUPI, DNN and S-NSSAI is
not available, then SMF retrieves the Session Management Subscription
data using Nudm\_SDM\_Get (SUPI, Session Management Subscription data,
DNN, S-NSSAI) and subscribes to be notified when this subscription data
is modified using Nudm\_SDM\_Subscribe (SUPI, Session Management
Subscription data, DNN, S-NSSAI).

NOTE 3: The SMF can, instead of the Nudm\_SDM\_Get service operation,
use the Nudm\_SDM\_Subscribe service operation with an Immediate Report
Indication that triggers the UDM to immediately return the subscribed
data if the corresponding feature is supported by both the SMF and the
UDM.

10\. The SMF+PGW-C performs release of the resources in EPC for the PDN
connections(s) transferred to 5GS by performing the PDN GW initiated
bearer deactivation procedure as defined in clause 5.4.4.1 of
TS 23.401 \[13\], except the steps 4-7.

specified in: TS 23.502, clause 4.9.2.1 and TS 23.502, clause 4.11.2.2.

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.9.2.1\]

Clause 4.9.2.1 specifies how to hand over a UE from a source Untrusted
non-3GPP access to a target 3GPP access and how a UE can handover a PDU
Session from untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access. It is based on
the PDU Session Establishment procedure for 3GPP access as specified in
clause 4.3.2.

Figure 4.9.2.1-1: Handover of a PDU Session procedure from untrusted
non-3GPP access to 3GPP access (non-roaming and roaming with local
breakout)

1\. If the UE is not registered via 3GPP access, the UE shall initiate
Registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.2.

2\. The UE performs a PDU Session Establishment procedure with the PDU
Session ID of the PDU Session to be moved as specified clause 4.3.2.2.1
(PDU Session Establishment for Non-roaming and Roaming with Local
Breakout).

When sending the PDU Session Establishment Accept, within the N1 SM
container and in the N2 SM information, the SMF shall include all QoS
information (e.g. QoS Rule(s) in N1 SM container, QFI(s) and QoS
Profile(s) in N2 SM information) for the QoS Flow(s) that are applicable
to the PDU Session for the target access.

3\. If the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated in non-3GPP
access, the SMF executes the release of resources in non-3GPP access by
initiating a Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer (to send N2
resource release request) which triggers performing steps 4 to 7
specified in clause 4.12.7, followed by step 7a/7b specified in clause
4.3.4.2 in order to release the resources over the source non-3GPP
access. Because the PDU Session shall not be released, the SMF shall not
send the PDU Session Release Command to the UE. Hence, in steps 4 and 7
of clause 4.12.7 as well as in step 7a of clause 4.3.4.2, the messages
do not include the N1 SM container but only the N2 Resource Release
Request (resp. Ack). Since the PDU Session is not to be released, the
SMF shall not execute step 11 of clause 4.3.4.2 and the SM context
between the AMF and the SMF is maintained.

If the User Plane of the PDU Session is deactivated in non-3GPP access,
this step is skipped.

The steps 2 and 3 shall be repeated for all PDU Sessions to be moved
from to untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.

If the UE is moving to the NB-IoT RAT type of 3GPP access, the PDU
Session Establishment request would be rejected by AMF when the UP
resources exceeds the UE\'s maximum number of supported UP resources as
described in clause 5.4.5.2.4 of TS 24.501 \[25\].

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.11.2.2\]

The following procedure is used by UEs in single-registration or dual
registration mode on mobility from 5GS to EPS.

In the case of network sharing the UE selects the target PLMN ID
according to clause 5.18.3 of TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.11.2.2-1: Mobility procedure from 5GS to EPS without N26
interface

The UE operating in single-registration mode can start the procedure
from Step 1 or Step 5. The UE operating in dual-registration mode starts
the procedure from Step 5.

NOTE 1: The network has indicated the \"Interworking without N26\" to
the UE. To support IP address preservation, the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 5. If the UE in
single-registration mode starts the procedure from Step 1, the IP
address preservation is not provided.

0\. UE is registered in 5GS and established PDU sessions. The FQDN for
the S5/S8 interface of the PGW-C+SMF is also stored in the UDM by the
PGW-C+SMF during PDU Session setup in addition to what is specified in
clause 4.3.2.2.1 and clause 4.3.2.2.2.

NOTE 2: At 5GS to EPS mobility, the MME use the FQDN for the S5/S8
interface of the PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF, and when UE moves back
from EPS to 5GS, the AMF uses FQDN for the S5/S8 interface of the
PGW-C+SMF to find the PGW-C+SMF.

1\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in TS 23.401
\[13\].

2\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in TS 23.401
\[13\] with the following modifications:

The UE shall provide a EPS-GUTI that is mapped from the 5G-GUTI
following the mapping rules specified in TS 23.501 \[2\]. The UE
indicates that it is moving from 5GC.

3\. Step 3 as in clause 5.3.3.1 (Tracking Area Update) in TS 23.401
\[13\].

4\. If the MME determined that the old node is an AMF based on UE\'s
GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI and the MME is configured to support 5GS-EPS
interworking without N26 procedure, the MME sends a TAU Reject to the
UE.

5\. Step 1 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
\[13\] with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

6\. Step 2 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
\[13\].

7\. Steps 4-7 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
\[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

8\. Step 8 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
\[13\], with the modifications captured in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

9\. Step 11 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
\[13\], with the following modifications:

The subscription profile the MME receives from HSS+UDM includes per
DNN/APN at most one PGW-C+SMF FQDN as described in in clause 5.17.2.1 in
TS 23.501 \[2\].

10\. Steps 12-24 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS
23.401 \[13\], with the modifications as described in clause 4.11.2.4.1.

11\. Step 25 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
\[13\].

12\. Step 26 as in clause 5.3.2.1 (E-UTRAN Initial Attach) in TS 23.401
\[13\].

13\. If the UE has remaining PDU Sessions in 5GS which it wants to
transfer to EPS and maintain the same IP address/prefix, the UE performs
the UE requested PDN Connectivity Procedure as specified in TS 23.401
\[13\] clause 5.10.2 and sets the Request Type to \"handover\" in Step 1
of the procedure with modification captured in clause 4.11.2.4.2. UE
provides an APN and the PDU Session ID corresponding to the PDU Session
it wants to transfer to EPS. The UE provides the PDU Session ID in PCO
as described in clause 4.11.1.1.

UEs in single-registration mode performs this step for each PDU Session
immediately after completing the E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. UEs
in dual-registration mode may perform this step any time after the
completing of E-UTRAN Initial Attach procedure. Also, UEs in
dual-registration mode may perform this step only for a subset of PDU
Sessions.

The MME determines the PGW-C+SMF address for the Create Session Request
based on the APN received from the UE and the subscription profile
received from the HSS+UDM in Step 9 or when the HSS+UDM notifies the MME
for the new PGW-C+SMF ID in the updated subscription profile.

The PGW-C+SMF uses the PDU Session ID to correlate the transferred PDN
connection with the PDU Session in 5GC.

As a result of the procedure the PGW-U+UPF starts routing DL data
packets to the Serving GW for the default and any dedicated EPS bearers
established for this PDN connection.

14\. The PGW-C+SMF initiates release of the PDU Session(s) in 5GS
transferred to EPS as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 with the following
clarification:

In step 2, the PGW-C+SMF shall not release IP address/prefix(es)
allocated for the PDU Session.

If UP connection of the PDU Session is not active, step 3b is not
executed, thus the steps triggered by step 3b are not executed;

If UP connection of the PDU Session is active, the SMF invokes the
Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation without
including N1 SM container (PDU Session Release Command).

### 11.8.5 Inter-system mobility between untrusted Non-3GPP and 3GPP system/Handover from 5GS to EPC/ePDG

##### 11.8.5.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-73 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-168 .H6}

**With** { the UE supports N1 mode and S1 mode and IP address
preservation between EPC/ePDG and 5GS, at least one PDU Sessions have
been established between the UE and the SMF/UPF via NG-RAN }

**ensure that** {

**when** { When UE detect cellular not available and performs a handover
of existing PDU session to ePDG/EPC }

**then** { the UE shall include the CFG\_REQUEST Configuration payload
containing the type of IP address, the \"IDr\" payload containing the
APN in the Identification Data, the \"IDi\" payload containing the NAI,
the N1\_MODE\_CAPABILITY Notify payload. }

}

##### 11.8.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-72 .H6}

\[Rel-15, TS 24.302, clause 7.2.2.1\]

Once the ePDG has been selected, the UE shall initiate the IPsec tunnel
establishment procedure using the IKEv2 protocol as defined in
IETF RFC 7296 \[28\] and 3GPP TS 33.402 \[15\].

The UE shall send an IKE\_SA\_INIT request message to the selected ePDG
in order to setup an IKEv2 security association. Upon receipt of an
IKE\_SA\_INIT response, the UE shall send an IKE\_AUTH request message
to the ePDG, including:

\- The type of IP address (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix or both) that
needs to be configured in an IKEv2 CFG\_REQUEST Configuration Payload.
If the UE requests for both IPv4 address and IPv6 prefix, the UE shall
send two configuration attributes in the CFG\_REQUEST Configuration
Payload: one for the IPv4 address and the other for the IPv6 prefix;

\- The \"IDr\" payload, containing the APN in the Identification Data,
for non-emergency session establishment. For emergency session
establishment, the UE shall format the \"IDr\" payload according to
clause 7.2.5. The UE shall set the ID Type field of the \"IDr\" payload
to ID\_FQDN as defined in IETF RFC 7296 \[28\]. The UE indicates a
request for the default APN by omitting the \"IDr\" payload, which is in
accordance with IKEv2 protocol as defined in IETF RFC 7296 \[28\]; and

\- The \"IDi\" payload containing the NAI.

If the UE supports N1 mode, the UE shall indicate the PDU session ID in
the IKE\_AUTH request message. If N1 mode capability is disabled, the UE
may indicate the PDU session ID in the IKE\_AUTH request message.

In order to indicate the PDU session ID in the IKE\_AUTH request
message, the UE shall include the N1\_MODE\_CAPABILITY Notify payload as
defined in clause 8.2.9.15 in the IKE\_AUTH request message and shall:

\- if the UE is establishing a PDN connection not related to any
existing PDU session or any existing PDN connection, allocate a PDU
session ID which is not currently being used by another PDU session over
either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, set the PDU Session ID field of
the N1\_MODE\_CAPABILITY Notify payload to the allocated PDU session ID,
and associate the allocated PDU session ID with the PDN connection that
is being established;

if the UE is transferring an existing PDU session from 5GS, set the PDU
Session ID field of the N1\_MODE\_CAPABILITY Notify payload to the PDU
session ID of the existing PDU session that is being transferred, and
associate the PDU session ID with the PDN connection that is being
established. If the existing PDU session is a non-emergency PDU session,
the UE shall in addition associate the S-NSSAI of the existing PDU
session that is being transferred and the related PLMN ID with the PDN
connection that is being established; or

\- if the UE is transferring an existing PDN connection from EPS and a
PDU session ID is associated with the PDN connection that is being
transferred, set the PDU Session ID field of the N1\_MODE\_CAPABILITY
Notify payload to the PDU session ID associated with the existing PDN
connection. If the existing PDN connection is a non-emergency PDN
connection and an S-NSSAI and a related PLMN ID are associated with the
existing PDN connection, the UE shall in addition associate the S-NSSAI
and the related PLMN ID with the PDN connection that is being
established.

...

During the IKEv2 authentication and security association establishment
for handover, the UE supporting IP address preservation for NBM, shall
provide an indication about Attach Type, which indicates Handover
Attach. During the IKEv2 authentication and security association
establishment for transfer of an existing PDU session from 5GS, the UE
shall provide an indication about Attach Type, which indicates Handover
Attach. To indicate attach due to handover, the UE shall include the
previously allocated home address information during the IPSec tunnel
establishment. Depending on the IP version, the UE shall include either
the INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS or the INTERNAL\_IP6\_ADDRESS attribute or
both in the CFG\_REQUEST Configuration Payload within the IKE\_AUTH
request message to indicate the home address information which is in
accordance with IKEv2 protocol as defined in IETF RFC 7296 \[28\]. If
the previously allocated home address information consists of both an
IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix, then the UE shall include the
INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS attribute and the INTERNAL\_IP6\_ADDRESS
attribute in the CFG\_REQUEST configuration payload within the IKE\_AUTH
request message. If the previously allocated home address information
consists of an IPv4 address only, then the UE shall include the
INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS attribute and shall not include the
INTERNAL\_IP6\_ADDRESS attribute in the CFG\_REQUEST configuration
payload within the IKE\_AUTH request message. If the previously
allocated home address information consists of an IPv6 prefix only, then
the UE shall include the INTERNAL\_IP6\_ADDRESS attribute and shall not
include the INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS attribute in the CFG\_REQUEST
configuration payload within the IKE\_AUTH request message. The UE shall
support IPSec ESP (see IETF RFC 4303 \[32\]) in order to provide secure
tunnels between the UE and the ePDG as specified in
3GPP TS 33.402 \[15\].

...

After the successful authentication with the 3GPP AAA server, the UE
receives from the ePDG an IKE\_AUTH response message containing a single
CFG\_REPLY Configuration Payload including the assigned remote IP
address information (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix) as described in
clause 7.4.1. Depending on the used IP mobility management mechanism the
following cases can be differentiated:

\- If DSMIPv6 is used for IP mobility management, the UE configures a
remote IP address based on the IP address information contained in the
INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS or INTERNAL\_IP6\_SUBNET attribute of the
CFG\_REPLY Configuration Payload. The UE uses the remote IP address as
Care-of-Address to contact the HA.

\- If NBM is used for IP mobility management and the UE performs an
initial attach, the UE configures a home address based on the address
information from the CFG\_REPLY Configuration Payload. Otherwise, if NBM
is used and the UE performs a handover attach, the UE continues to use
its IP address configured before the handover, if the address
information provided in the CFG\_REPLY Configuration Payload does match
with the UE\'s IP address configured before the handover. If the UE\'s
IP address (IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix) does not match with the address
information of the CFG\_REPLY Configuration Payload, the UE shall
configure a new home address based on the IP address information
contained in the INTERNAL\_IP4\_ADDRESS, INTERNAL\_IP6\_SUBNET or
INTERNAL\_IP6\_ADDRESS attribute of the CFG\_REPLY Configuration
Payload. In the latter case, the IP address preservation is not
possible.

NOTE 3: In case of IPv6 address, the UE performs the match only on the
IPv6 prefix provided within the CFG\_REPLY Configuration Payload
contained in the INTERNAL\_IP6\_SUBNET or INTERNAL\_IP6\_ADDRESS.

...

During the IKEv2 authentication and security association establishment,
following the UE\'s initial IKE\_AUTH request message to the ePDG, if
the UE subsequently receives an IKE\_AUTH response message from the ePDG
containing the EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge, after verifying the received
authentication parameters and successfully authenticating the ePDG as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.402 \[15\], the UE shall send a new IKE\_AUTH
request message to the ePDG including the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge. In
addition, the UE shall provide the requested mobile device identity if
available, as specified in clause 7.2.6.

If the UE supports P-CSCF restoration extension for untrusted WLAN as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 \[66\], the UE shall **send its** capability
indication of the support of P-CSCF restoration to the ePDG by including
the P-CSCF\_RESELECTION\_SUPPORT Notify payload within an IKE\_AUTH
request message**.** The content of the P-CSCF\_RESELECTION\_SUPPORT
Notify payload is described in clause 8.2.9.4.

If the UE supports N1 mode and the UE receives the N1\_MODE\_INFORMATION
Notify payload as defined in clause 8.2.9.16 in the IKE\_AUTH response
message, the UE shall delete the associated S-NSSAI, if any, and
(re‑)associate the S-NSSAI in the S-NSSAI Value field of the
N1\_MODE\_INFORMATION Notify payload with the PDU session associated
with the IKEv2 security association that was established, and if the UE
receives the N1\_MODE\_S\_NSSAI\_PLMN\_ID Notify payload as defined in
clause 8.2.9.17 in the IKE\_AUTH response message, the UE shall delete
the associated PLMN ID, if any, and (re-)associate the PLMN ID that the
S-NSSAI relates to in the S-NSSAI PLMN ID field of the
N1\_MODE\_S\_NSSAI\_PLMN\_ID Notify payload with the PDU session
associated with the IKEv2 security association that was established.

Registration procedures General

A UE needs to register with the network to get authorized to receive
services, to enable mobility tracking and to enable reachability. The UE
initiates the Registration procedure using one of the following
Registration types:

-Initial Registration to the 5GS;

-Mobility Registration Update upon changing to a new Tracking Area (TA)
outside the UE\'s Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE
state, or when the UE needs to update its capabilities or protocol
parameters that are negotiated in Registration procedure with or without
changing to a new TA, a change in the UE\'s Preferred Network Behaviour
that would create an incompatibility with the Supported Network
Behaviour provided by the serving AMF, or when the UE intends to
retrieve LADN Information, or with NR satellite access upon changing to
a suitable cell indicating multiple TAs for the RPLMN all of which are
outside the UE\'s Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE
state, or when the Multi-USIM UE needs a new 5G-GUTI assignment; or

-Periodic Registration Update (due to a predefined time period of
inactivity); or

-Emergency Registration; or

-Disaster Roaming Initial Registration, as specified in clause 5.40 of
TS 23.501 \[2\]; or

-Disaster Roaming Mobility Registration Update, as specified in clause
5.40 of TS 23.501 \[2\]; or

-SNPN Onboarding Registration allows the UE to access an ON-SNPN for the
purpose of provisioning the UE with SO-SNPN credentials to enable
SO-SNPN access. SNPN Onboarding Registration is only applicable for
registration with ON-SNPN i.e. when the UE uses PLMN credentials for
accessing an ONN the UE initiates an Initial Registration. The SNPN
Onboarding Registration is specified in clause 4.2.2.2.4.

\[Rel-15, TS 23.502, clause 4.3.2.2\]

UE Requested PDU Session Establishment

PDU Session establishment. The procedure is used to:

-Establish a new PDU Session;

-Handover a PDN Connection in EPS to PDU Session in 5GS without N26
interface;

-Switching an existing PDU Session between non-3GPP access and 3GPP
access. The specific system behaviour in this case is further defined in
clauses 4.9.2 and 4.9.3; or

-Request a PDU Session for Emergency services.

The Request Type indicates \"Existing PDU Session\" if the request
refers to an existing PDU Session switching between 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access or to a PDU Session handover from an existing PDN
connection in EPC. If the request refers to an existing PDN connection
in EPC, the S-NSSAI is set as described in clause 5.15.7.2 of
TS 23.501 \[2\]

\[Rel-15, TS 23.402, clause 7.9.2-1\]

PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation with GTP on S2b

This procedure can be used to deactivate a dedicated bearer or
deactivate all bearers belonging to a PDN address, for example, due to
IP CAN session modification requests from the PCRF or due to handover
from Non-3GPP to 3GPP access. If the default bearer belonging to a PDN
connection is deactivated, the PDN GW deactivates all bearers belonging
to the PDN connection.

When it is performed for a handover, the connections associated with the
PDN address are released, but the PDN address is kept in the PDN GW.

1\. The PDN GW initiated Resource Allocation Deactivation can also be
triggered during handovers from Non-3GPP to 3GPP.

2\. The PDN GW sends a Delete Bearer Request message (EPS Bearer
Identity or Linked EPS Bearer Identity, Cause) to the ePDG. The Linked
EPS Bearer Identity shall be present and set to the identity of the
default bearer associated with the PDN connection if the PDN GW requests
to release all the bearers of the PDN connection. Otherwise, the EPS
Bearer Identity shall be present and set to the identity of the
dedicated S2b bearer(s) to release if the PDN GW requests to deactivate
dedicated S2b bearer(s).

3a. If the PDN connection has multiple active S2b bearers, and the ePDG
maintained a binding with a IPsec SA for the S2b bearer that is being
released, then it shall use the IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange with Delete
Payloads, as defined in \[9\], to remove the IPsec SA between ePDG and
UE over SWu for the deactivated S2b bearer. Otherwise, the IKEv2 tunnel
release is triggered from the ePDG if all bearers belonging to the PDN
connection are released.

3b. The resources may be released in the non-3GPP IP access according to
the conditions in step 3a.

4\. The ePDG deletes the bearer contexts related to the Delete Bearer
Request, and acknowledges the bearer deactivation to the PDN GW by
sending a Delete Bearer Response (EPS Bearer Identity, User Location
Information) message.

5\. In the case where the resources corresponding to the PDN connection
are released in PDN GW, the PDN GW informs the 3GPP AAA Server of the
PDN disconnection. If the UE no longer has any context in the 3GPP AAA
Server, the 3GPP AAA Server notifies the HSS as described in
clause 12.1.2.

6\. The PDN GW deletes the bearer context related to the deactivated EPS
bearer. If the dedicated bearer deactivation procedure was triggered by
receiving a PCC decision message from the PCRF, the PDN GW indicates to
the PCRF whether the requested PCC decision was successfully enforced by
completing the PCRF-initiated IP CAN Session Modification procedure or
the PCEF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure as defined in
TS 23.203 \[19\], proceeding after the completion of IP CAN bearer
signalling. If requested by the PCRF, the PDN GW forwards to the PCRF
following information extracted from User Location Information it may
have received from the ePDG.

}

##### 11.9.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-75 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.8.2.3, 6.4.1.2 and TS 24.193 clause
4.6. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.3\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode when:

a\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type and at least one PDU session of
Unstructured PDU session type is active;

b\) the UE supports IPv4 PDN type and at least one PDU session of IPv4
PDU session type is active;

c\) the UE supports IPv6 PDN type and at least one PDU session of IPv6
PDU session type is active;

d\) the UE supports IPv4v6 PDN type and at least one PDU session of
IPv4v6 PDU session type is active; or

e\) at least one PDU session of Ethernet PDU session type is active and:

1\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type; or

2\) the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode;

the UE shall proceed as follows:

a\) if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\"
or \"handover of emergency bearer services\" to transfer a PDU session
from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE has received an \"interworking
without N26 interface supported\" indication from the network, the UE
shall:

1\) enter substates EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-
DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE for 3GPP access;

2\) map the PDU session(s) which the UE intends to transfer to EPS to
the default EPS bearer context of the corresponding PDN connection(s) as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.2; and

3\) initiate an EPS attach procedure and include in the ATTACH REQUEST
message a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with:

\- the request type set to \"handover of emergency bearer services\" to
activate a default EPS bearer context for an active emergency PDU
session, if the session to be transferred is an emergency PDU session;
or

\- the request type set to \"handover\" message to activate a default
EPS bearer context for an active non-emergency PDU session, if the
session to be transferred is a non-emergency PDU session. If the
selected PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access,
the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.

...

After having successfully registered in N1 mode over 3GPP access, the UE
shall reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access, and the
attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]) and:

a\) if the UE supports the PDU session establishment procedure with
request type set to \"existing PDU session\" or \"existing emergency PDU
session\" to transfer a PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode and the
UE has received an \"interworking without N26 interface supported\"
indication from the network, attempt to transfer the PDN connection(s)
which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, from S1 mode to N1 mode
by:

\- if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, initiating the PDU session
establishment procedure with request type set to \"existing emergency
PDU session\" to transfer the PDN connection for emergency bearer
services; and

\- if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a
non-emergency PDN connection, initiating the PDU session establishment
procedure with request type set to:

1\) \"MA PDU request\", if the PDN connection to be transferred is a
user-plane resource of an MA PDU session; or

2\) \"existing PDU session\" to transfer the non-emergency PDN
connection; and

b\) otherwise, establish PDU session(s) corresponding to the PDN
connection(s) which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, by
initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set
to \"initial request\".

See subclause 5.1.4.3 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

...

If the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session and the UE supports
to establish a PDN connection as the user plane resource of an MA PDU
session, the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

\[TS 24.193, clause 4.6\]

In the network supporting N26 interface:

a\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over non-3GPP access only,
no EPS bearer identity can be assigned to any QoS flow of the MA PDU
session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\];

b\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access and the user plane of the MA PDU session over 3GPP
access is released, the EPS bearer identity assigned for the MA PDU
session can be revoked as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\];

c\) for an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode:

1\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access only, the
UE follows the procedure as specified in clause 6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS
24.501 \[6\]; or

2\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access, the UE follows the procedure as specified in clause
6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], and

A\) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and
the UE did not indicate its support of establishing a PDN connection as
the user plane resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501
\[6\], the SMF can initiate the network-requested PDU session release
procedure over non-3GPP access as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS
24.501 \[6\] or perform a local release of the MA PDU session. The UE
performs a local release of the MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access;

NOTE 1: If the UE receives from the network a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message which indicates to release the MA PDU session over
non-3GPP access and the UE has already performed or is performing a
local release of the MA PDU session, the error handling as specified in
clause 6.3.3.6 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] is applied.

NOTE 2: The QoS flow(s) with EBI assigned over non-3GPP access is also
transferred to the corresponding PDN connection.

B\) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and
the UE indicated its support of establishing a PDN connection as the
user plane resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501
\[6\], the SMF can keep the MA PDU session over non-3GPP access; or

C\) if the MA PDU session is not transferred to EPS as a PDN connection
and the SMF decides to move the traffic of the MA PDU session from 3GPP
access to non-3GPP access, the SMF can initiate the network-requested
PDU session modification procedure as specified in clause 6.3.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]; and

d\) for an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the UE
requests an MA PDU session or the related URSP or UE local configuration
does not mandate that the PDU session is established over a single
access when transferring the PDN connection to 3GPP access, the PDN
connection can be converted by the network to an MA PDU session via the
UE-requested PDU session modification procedure (see clause 5.2.5).

}

##### 11.9.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-76 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.8.2.3, 6.4.1.2 and TS 24.193 clause
4.6. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.3\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode when:

a\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type and at least one PDU session of
Unstructured PDU session type is active;

b\) the UE supports IPv4 PDN type and at least one PDU session of IPv4
PDU session type is active;

c\) the UE supports IPv6 PDN type and at least one PDU session of IPv6
PDU session type is active;

d\) the UE supports IPv4v6 PDN type and at least one PDU session of
IPv4v6 PDU session type is active; or

e\) at least one PDU session of Ethernet PDU session type is active and:

1\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type; or

2\) the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode;

the UE shall proceed as follows:

a\) if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\"
or \"handover of emergency bearer services\" to transfer a PDU session
from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE has received an \"interworking
without N26 interface supported\" indication from the network, the UE
shall:

1\) enter substates EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-
DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE for 3GPP access;

2\) map the PDU session(s) which the UE intends to transfer to EPS to
the default EPS bearer context of the corresponding PDN connection(s) as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.2; and

3\) initiate an EPS attach procedure and include in the ATTACH REQUEST
message a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with:

\- the request type set to \"handover of emergency bearer services\" to
activate a default EPS bearer context for an active emergency PDU
session, if the session to be transferred is an emergency PDU session;
or

\- the request type set to \"handover\" message to activate a default
EPS bearer context for an active non-emergency PDU session, if the
session to be transferred is a non-emergency PDU session. If the
selected PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access,
the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.

After successful completion of the EPS attach procedure, the UE shall
reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access and the attach
attempt counter (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]), enter substates
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE for
3GPP access and attempt to activate each of the other default EPS bearer
contexts, if any, by initiating a stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure
with request type set to \"handover\" for non-emergency PDU session or
\"handover of emergency bearer services\" for emergency PDU session in
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. If the EPS attach procedure is
unsuccessful the UE shall enter substates
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE
for 3GPP access; and

b\) otherwise, enter substates EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE for 3GPP access and initiate a
tracking area update procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

...

After having successfully registered in N1 mode over 3GPP access, the UE
shall reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access, and the
attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]) and:

a\) if the UE supports the PDU session establishment procedure with
request type set to \"existing PDU session\" or \"existing emergency PDU
session\" to transfer a PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode and the
UE has received an \"interworking without N26 interface supported\"
indication from the network, attempt to transfer the PDN connection(s)
which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, from S1 mode to N1 mode
by:

\- if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, initiating the PDU session
establishment procedure with request type set to \"existing emergency
PDU session\" to transfer the PDN connection for emergency bearer
services; and

\- if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a
non-emergency PDN connection, initiating the PDU session establishment
procedure with request type set to:

1\) \"MA PDU request\", if the PDN connection to be transferred is a
user-plane resource of an MA PDU session; or

2\) \"existing PDU session\" to transfer the non-emergency PDN
connection; and

b\) otherwise, establish PDU session(s) corresponding to the PDN
connection(s) which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, by
initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set
to \"initial request\".

See subclause 5.1.4.3 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

...

If the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session and the UE supports
to establish a PDN connection as the user plane resource of an MA PDU
session, the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

\[TS 24.193, clause 4.6\]

In the network supporting N26 interface:

a\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over non-3GPP access only,
no EPS bearer identity can be assigned to any QoS flow of the MA PDU
session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\];

b\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access and the user plane of the MA PDU session over 3GPP
access is released, the EPS bearer identity assigned for the MA PDU
session can be revoked as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\];

c\) for an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode:

1\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access only, the
UE follows the procedure as specified in clause 6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS
24.501 \[6\]; or

2\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access, the UE follows the procedure as specified in clause
6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], and

A\) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and
the UE did not indicate its support of establishing a PDN connection as
the user plane resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501
\[6\], the SMF can initiate the network-requested PDU session release
procedure over non-3GPP access as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS
24.501 \[6\] or perform a local release of the MA PDU session. The UE
performs a local release of the MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access;

NOTE 1: If the UE receives from the network a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message which indicates to release the MA PDU session over
non-3GPP access and the UE has already performed or is performing a
local release of the MA PDU session, the error handling as specified in
clause 6.3.3.6 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] is applied.

NOTE 2: The QoS flow(s) with EBI assigned over non-3GPP access is also
transferred to the corresponding PDN connection.

B\) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and
the UE indicated its support of establishing a PDN connection as the
user plane resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501
\[6\], the SMF can keep the MA PDU session over non-3GPP access; or

C\) if the MA PDU session is not transferred to EPS as a PDN connection
and the SMF decides to move the traffic of the MA PDU session from 3GPP
access to non-3GPP access, the SMF can initiate the network-requested
PDU session modification procedure as specified in clause 6.3.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]; and

d\) for an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the UE
requests an MA PDU session or the related URSP or UE local configuration
does not mandate that the PDU session is established over a single
access when transferring the PDN connection to 3GPP access, the PDN
connection can be converted by the network to an MA PDU session via the
UE-requested PDU session modification procedure (see clause 5.2.5).

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.6.1.2.2\]

The network initiates the ESM information request procedure by sending
an ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the UE, starting timer T3489 and
entering the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.6.1.2.2.1). This message shall be sent only after the security
context has been setup, and if the ESM information transfer flag has
been set in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. The MME shall set the
EPS bearer identity of the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the value
\"no EPS bearer identity assigned\" and include the PTI from the
associated PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

##### 11.9.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-77 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.8.2.3, 6.4.1.2 and TS 24.193 clause
4.6. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.8.2.3\]

At inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode when:

a\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type and at least one PDU session of
Unstructured PDU session type is active;

b\) the UE supports IPv4 PDN type and at least one PDU session of IPv4
PDU session type is active;

c\) the UE supports IPv6 PDN type and at least one PDU session of IPv6
PDU session type is active;

d\) the UE supports IPv4v6 PDN type and at least one PDU session of
IPv4v6 PDU session type is active; or

e\) at least one PDU session of Ethernet PDU session type is active and:

1\) the UE supports non-IP PDN type; or

2\) the UE and the network support Ethernet PDN type in S1 mode;

the UE shall proceed as follows:

a\) if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\"
or \"handover of emergency bearer services\" to transfer a PDU session
from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE has received an \"interworking
without N26 interface supported\" indication from the network, the UE
shall:

1\) enter substates EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-
DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE for 3GPP access;

2\) map the PDU session(s) which the UE intends to transfer to EPS to
the default EPS bearer context of the corresponding PDN connection(s) as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.2; and

3\) initiate an EPS attach procedure and include in the ATTACH REQUEST
message a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with:

\- the request type set to \"handover of emergency bearer services\" to
activate a default EPS bearer context for an active emergency PDU
session, if the session to be transferred is an emergency PDU session;
or

\- the request type set to \"handover\" message to activate a default
EPS bearer context for an active non-emergency PDU session, if the
session to be transferred is a non-emergency PDU session. If the
selected PDU session is an MA PDU session established over 3GPP access,
the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.

After successful completion of the EPS attach procedure, the UE shall
reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access and the attach
attempt counter (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]), enter substates
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE for
3GPP access and attempt to activate each of the other default EPS bearer
contexts, if any, by initiating a stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure
with request type set to \"handover\" for non-emergency PDU session or
\"handover of emergency bearer services\" for emergency PDU session in
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. If the EPS attach procedure is
unsuccessful the UE shall enter substates
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE
for 3GPP access; and

b\) otherwise, enter substates EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE for 3GPP access and initiate a
tracking area update procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

...

After having successfully registered in N1 mode over 3GPP access, the UE
shall reset the registration attempt counter for 3GPP access, and the
attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]) and:

a\) if the UE supports the PDU session establishment procedure with
request type set to \"existing PDU session\" or \"existing emergency PDU
session\" to transfer a PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode and the
UE has received an \"interworking without N26 interface supported\"
indication from the network, attempt to transfer the PDN connection(s)
which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, from S1 mode to N1 mode
by:

\- if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, initiating the PDU session
establishment procedure with request type set to \"existing emergency
PDU session\" to transfer the PDN connection for emergency bearer
services; and

\- if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a
non-emergency PDN connection, initiating the PDU session establishment
procedure with request type set to:

1\) \"MA PDU request\", if the PDN connection to be transferred is a
user-plane resource of an MA PDU session; or

2\) \"existing PDU session\" to transfer the non-emergency PDN
connection; and

b\) otherwise, establish PDU session(s) corresponding to the PDN
connection(s) which the UE intends to transfer to 5GS, if any, by
initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set
to \"initial request\".

See subclause 5.1.4.3 for coordination between 5GMM and EMM and
subclause 6.1.4.2 for coordination between 5GSM and ESM.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

...

If the UE requests to establish a new MA PDU session and the UE supports
to establish a PDN connection as the user plane resource of an MA PDU
session, the UE shall include the ATSSS request parameter in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

\[TS 24.193, clause 4.6\]

In the network supporting N26 interface:

a\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over non-3GPP access only,
no EPS bearer identity can be assigned to any QoS flow of the MA PDU
session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\];

b\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access and the user plane of the MA PDU session over 3GPP
access is released, the EPS bearer identity assigned for the MA PDU
session can be revoked as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\];

c\) for an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode:

1\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access only, the
UE follows the procedure as specified in clause 6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS
24.501 \[6\]; or

2\) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access, the UE follows the procedure as specified in clause
6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\], and

A\) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and
the UE did not indicate its support of establishing a PDN connection as
the user plane resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501
\[6\], the SMF can initiate the network-requested PDU session release
procedure over non-3GPP access as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS
24.501 \[6\] or perform a local release of the MA PDU session. The UE
performs a local release of the MA PDU session over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access;

NOTE 1: If the UE receives from the network a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message which indicates to release the MA PDU session over
non-3GPP access and the UE has already performed or is performing a
local release of the MA PDU session, the error handling as specified in
clause 6.3.3.6 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\] is applied.

NOTE 2: The QoS flow(s) with EBI assigned over non-3GPP access is also
transferred to the corresponding PDN connection.

B\) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and
the UE indicated its support of establishing a PDN connection as the
user plane resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501
\[6\], the SMF can keep the MA PDU session over non-3GPP access; or

C\) if the MA PDU session is not transferred to EPS as a PDN connection
and the SMF decides to move the traffic of the MA PDU session from 3GPP
access to non-3GPP access, the SMF can initiate the network-requested
PDU session modification procedure as specified in clause 6.3.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.501 \[6\]; and

d\) for an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the UE
requests an MA PDU session or the related URSP or UE local configuration
does not mandate that the PDU session is established over a single
access when transferring the PDN connection to 3GPP access, the PDN
connection can be converted by the network to an MA PDU session via the
UE-requested PDU session modification procedure (see clause 5.2.5).

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.6.1.2.2\]

The network initiates the ESM information request procedure by sending
an ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the UE, starting timer T3489 and
entering the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.6.1.2.2.1). This message shall be sent only after the security
context has been setup, and if the ESM information transfer flag has
been set in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. The MME shall set the
EPS bearer identity of the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the value
\"no EPS bearer identity assigned\" and include the PTI from the
associated PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.
