 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Aggregated Channel Bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth in which a UE is
configured to transmit and receive multiple contiguously aggregated
carriers.

**Bidirectional spectrum:** UL/DL common spectrum in which the UE
supports the configuration of uplink or downlink CCs.

**Beam correspondence:** the ability of the UE to select a suitable beam
for UL transmission based on DL measurements with or without relying on
UL beam sweeping.

**Carrier aggregation: Aggregation of two or more component carriers in
order to support wider transmission bandwidths.**

**Carrier aggregation band:** A set of one or more operating bands
across which multiple carriers are aggregated with a specific set of
technical requirements.

**Carrier aggregation bandwidth class:** A class defined by the
aggregated transmission bandwidth configuration and maximum number of
component carriers supported by a UE.

**Carrier aggregation configuration**: A combination of CA operating
band(s) and CA bandwidth class(es) supported by a UE.

NOTE: Carriers aggregated in each band can be contiguous or
non-contiguous.

**Cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth:** The cumulative aggregated
channel bandwidth is defined as the frequency band from the lowest edge
of the lowest CC to the upper edge of the highest CC of all UL and DL
configured CCs inside the bidirectional spectrum of the UE.

**EIRP(Link=Link angle, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of the UE such
that the link angle is aligned with the measurement angle. EIRP
(indicator to be measured) can be replaced by EIS, Frequency, EVM,
carrier Leakage, In-band emission and OBW.

**EIRP(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of
the EIRP of the UE such that the measurement angle is aligned with the
beam peak direction within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty.
EIRP (indicator to be measured) can be replaced by Frequency, EVM,
carrier Leakage, In-band emission and OBW

**EIRP(Link=Spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of
the EIRP spherical coverage of the UE such that the EIRP link and
measurement angles are aligned with the directions along the spherical
coverage grid within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty.
Alternatively, the spherical coverage grid can be replaced by the beam
peak search grid as the results from the Tx beam peak search can be
re-used for spherical coverage.

**EIS (effective isotropic sensitivity):** sensitivity for an isotropic
directivity device equivalent to the sensitivity of the discussed device
exposed to an incoming wave from a defined AoA

**EIS(Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of
the EIS of the UE such that the measurement angle is aligned with the RX
beam peak direction within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty.

NOTE 1: The sensitivity is the minimum received power level at which
specific requirement is met.

NOTE 2: Isotropic directivity is equal in all directions (i.e. 0 dBi).

**EIS(Link=Spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link angle):** measurement of
the EIS spherical coverage of the UE such that the EIS link and
measurement angles are aligned with the directions along the spherical
coverage grid within an acceptable measurement error uncertainty.
Alternatively, the spherical coverage grid can be replaced by the Rx
beam peak search grid as the results from the Rx beam peak search can be
re-used for spherical coverage.

**Fallback group:** Group of carrier aggregation bandwidth classes for
which it is mandatory for a UE to be able to fallback to lower order CA
bandwidth class configuration. It is not mandatory for a UE to be able
to fallback to lower order CA bandwidth class configuration that belong
to a different fallback group.

**FWA UE:** A UE intended to be used in fixed wireless access scenario.

**Handheld UE:** A UE intended to be used in hand held scenario.

**IBM(Independent Beam Management):** A UE that supports inter-band CA

aggregated in the same operating band.

**Intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation:** Non-contiguous
carriers aggregated in the same operating band.

**Link angle:** a DL-signal AoA from the view point of the UE, as
described in Annex J. If the beam lock function is used to lock the UE
beam(s), the link angle can become any arbitrary AoA once the beam lock
has been activated.

**Measurement angle:** the angle of measurement of the desired metric
from the view point of the UE, as described in Annex J

**radiated interface boundary**: operating band specific radiated
requirements reference point where the radiated requirements apply

**radiated requirements reference point**: for the RF measurement setup,
the radiated requirements reference point is located at the centre of
the quiet zone. From the UE perspective the reference point is the input
of the UE antenna array

**RedCap UE**: The UE with reduced capabilities as defined in clause
4.2.21.1 from TS38.306 \[14\]

**RX beam peak direction**: direction where the maximum total component
of RSRP and thus best total component of EIS is found

**Sub-block:** This is one contiguous allocated block of spectrum for
transmission and reception by the same UE. There may be multiple
instances of sub-blocks within an RF bandwidth.

**TX beam peak direction:** direction where the maximum total component
of EIRP is found

**TRP(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid):** measurement of the
TRP of the UE such that the measurement angles are aligned with the
directions of the TRP grid points within an acceptable measurement
uncertainty while the link angle is aligned with the TX beam peak
direction

NOTE: For requirements based on EIRP/EIS, the radiated interface
boundary is associated to the far-field region

**UE transmission bandwidth configuration:** Set of resource blocks

4 General
=========

4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The present document is a Single-RAT specification for NR UE, covering
RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conformance to
the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the test
requirements specified in the conformance specification 3GPP TS 38.521-2
\[5\].

The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 38.521-2 \[5\]
defines test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the
minimum requirements in this specification to create test requirements.
For some requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test
tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined in
3GPP TS 38.521-2 \[5\].

4.2 Applicability of minimum requirements
-----------------------------------------

a\) In this specification the Minimum Requirements are specified as
general requirements and additional requirements. Where the Requirement
is specified as a general requirement, the requirement is mandated to be
met in all scenarios

b\) For specific scenarios for which an additional requirement is
specified, in addition to meeting the general requirement, the UE is
mandated to meet the additional requirements.

c\) The spurious emissions power requirements are for the long-term
average of the power. For the purpose of reducing measurement
uncertainty it is acceptable to average the measured power over a period
of time sufficient to reduce the uncertainty due to the statistical
nature of the signal

d\) All the requirements for intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous CA
apply under the assumption of the same slot format indicated by
*TDD-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and TDD-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* in
the PCell and SCells for NR SA.

For FR2 intra-band CA configurations with multiple FR2 sub-blocks, where
at least one of the sub-blocks is a contiguous CA configuration:

\- if the field *partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req* is not present, the UE shall
meet all applicable UE RF requirements for the highest order CA
configuration and all associated fallback CA configurations;

\- if the field *partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req* is present, for each FR2
intra-band CA configuration with multiple sub-blocks that the UE
indicates support for explicitly in UE capability signalling: the in-gap
UE RF requirements in clauses 7.5A, 7.5D, 7.6A, 7.6D apply as the
equivalent requirements for the associated fallback CA configurations
with the same number of sub-blocks, where at least one of the sub-blocks
consists of a contiguous CA configuration. The UE shall meet all
applicable UE RF requirements for fallback CA configurations with a
lesser number of sub-blocks;

\- regardless of the field *partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req*, the UE shall
meet all DL out-of-gap requirements for all lower order fallback CA
configurations.

5.3 UE Channel bandwidth
------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

The UE channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink
or downlink at the UE. From a BS perspective, different UE channel
bandwidths may be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to
and receiving from UEs connected to the BS. Transmission of multiple
carriers to the same UE (CA) or multiple carriers to different UEs
within the BS channel bandwidth can be supported.

From a UE perspective, the UE is configured with one or more BWP /
carriers, each with its own UE channel bandwidth. The UE does not need
to be aware of the BS channel bandwidth or how the BS allocates
bandwidth to different UEs.

The placement of the UE channel bandwidth for each UE carrier is
flexible but can only be completely within the BS channel bandwidth.

The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guardband and the
transmission bandwidth configuration is shown in Figure 5.3.1-1.

bandwidth configuration for one NR channel

### 5.3.2 Maximum transmission bandwidth configuration

The maximum transmission bandwidth configuration N~RB~ for each UE
channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing is specified in Table 5.3.2-1

### 5.3.3 Minimum guardband and transmission bandwidth configuration

The minimum guardband for each UE channel bandwidth and SCS is specified
in Table 5.3.3-1.

Table 5.3.3-1: Minimum guardband for each UE channel bandwidth and SCS
(kHz)

  ----------- -------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------- ----------
  SCS (kHz)   50 MHz   100 MHz   200 MHz   400 MHz   800 MHz   1600 MHz   2000 MHz
  60          1210     2450      4930      N/A       N/A       N/A        N/A
  120         1900     2420      4900      9860      N/A       N/A        N/A

  ----------- -------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------- ----------

NOTE: The minimum guardbands have been calculated using the following
equation: GB~Channel~ = (BW~Channel~ x 1000 (kHz) - N~RB~ x SCS x 12) /
2 - SCS/2, where N~RB~ are from Table 5.3.2-1 and GB~Channel~ expressed
in kHz.

The minimum guardband of receiving BS SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block for each
UE channel bandwidth is specified in table 5.3.3-2 for FR2.

Table: 5.3.3-2: Minimum guardband (kHz) of SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block in
FR2-1

  ----------- --------- --------- ---------
  SCS (kHz)   100 MHz   200 MHz   400 MHz
  240         3800      7720      15560
  ----------- --------- --------- ---------

NOTE: In FR2-1, the minimum guardband in Table 5.3.3-2 is applicable
only when the SCS 240 kHz SS/PBCH block is received adjacent to the edge
of the UE channel bandwidth within which the SS/PBCH block is located.

Figure 5.3.3-1: Void

The number of RBs configured in any channel bandwidth shall ensure that
the minimum guardband specified in this clause is met.

Figure 5.3.3-2 UE PRB utilization

In the case that multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same
symbol due to BS transmission of SSB, the minimum guardband on each side
of the carrier is the guardband applied at the configured channel
bandwidth for the numerology that is transmitted immediately adjacent to
the guard band.

If multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol and the UE
channel bandwidth is \> 200 MHz, the minimum guardband applied adjacent
to 60 kHz SCS shall be the same as the minimum guardband defined for 120
kHz SCS for the same UE channel bandwidth.

Figure 5.3.3-3 Guard band definition when transmitting multiple
numerologies

Note: Figure 5.3.3-3 is not intended to imply the size of any guard
between the two numerologies. Inter-numerology guard band within the
carrier is implementation dependent.

### 5.3.4 RB alignment

For each numerology, its common resource blocks are specified in Clause
4.4.4.3 in \[9\], and the starting point of its transmission bandwidth
configuration on the common resource block grid for a given channel
bandwidth is indicated by an offset to \"Reference point A\" in the unit
of the numerology. The *UE transmission bandwidth configuration* is
indicated by the higher layer parameter *carrierBandwidth \[13\] and
will* fulfil the minimum UE guardband requirement specified in Clause
5.3.3.

5.3.5 Channel bandwidth per operating band

The requirements in this specification apply to the combination of
channel bandwidths, SCS and operating bands shown in Table 5.3.5-1. The
transmission bandwidth configuration in Table 5.3.2-1 shall be supported
for each of the specified channel bandwidths. The channel bandwidths are
specified for both the Tx and Rx path.

5.3A UE channel bandwidth for CA
--------------------------------

### 5.3A.1 General

### 5.3A.2 Minimum guardband and transmission bandwidth configuration for CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, *Aggregated Channel
Bandwidth* and *Guard Bands* are defined as follows, see Figure
5.3A.2-1.

Figure 5.3A.2-1: Definition of *Aggregated Channel Bandwidth* for
intra-band carrier aggregation

The *aggregated channel bandwidth,* **BW~Channel\_CA~**, is defined as

BW~Channel\_CA~ = F~edge,high~ - F~edge,low~ (MHz).

The lower bandwidth edge F~edge,\ low~ and the upper bandwidth edge
F~edge,high~ of the aggregated channel bandwidth are used as frequency
reference points for transmitter and receiver requirements and are
defined by

F~edge,low~ = F~C,low~ - F~offset,low~

F~edge,high~ = F~C,high~ + F~offset,high~

The lower and upper frequency offsets depend on the transmission
bandwidth configurations of the lowest and highest assigned edge
component carrier and are defined as

F~offset,low~ = (N~RB,low~\*12 + 1)\*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)

F~offset,high~ = (N~RB,high~\*12 - 1)\*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)

BW~GB~ = max(GB~Channel,low~, GB~Channel,high~)

N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the transmission bandwidth configurations
according to Table 5.3.2-1 for the lowest and highest assigned component
carrier, SCS~low~ and SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier spacing for the
lowest and highest assigned component carrier respectively. SCS~low~,
SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, GB~Channel,low~ and GB~Channel,high~
use the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing configurations
supported in the operating band for both of the channel bandwidths
according to Table 5.3.5-1. GB~Channel,low~ and GB~Channel,high~ are the
minimum guard band for the lowest and highest assigned component carrier
according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said *μ* value, respectively.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation *Sub-block Bandwidth*
and *Sub-block edges* are defined as follows, see Figure 5.3A.2-2.

Figure 5.3A.2-2: Definition of sub-block bandwidth for intra-band
non-contiguous spectrum

The lower sub-block edge of the Sub-block Bandwidth (BW~Channel,block~)
is defined as

F~edge,block,\ low~ = F~C,block,low~ - F~offset,\ low.~

The upper sub-block edge of the Sub-block Bandwidth is defined as

F~edge,block,high~ = F~C,block,high~ + F~offset,\ high.~

The Sub-block Bandwidth, BW~Channel,block~, is defined as follows:

BW~Channel,block~ = F~edge,block,high\ -~ F~edge,block,low~ (MHz)

The lower and upper frequency offsets F~offset,block,low~ and
F~offset,block,high~ depend on the transmission bandwidth configurations
of the lowest and highest assigned edge component carriers within a
sub-block and are defined as

F~offset,block,low~ = (N~RB,low~\*12 + 1)\*SCS~low~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)

F~offset,block,high~ = (N~RB,high~\*12 - 1)\*SCS~high~/2 + BW~GB~ (MHz)

BW~GB~ = max(GB~Channel,low~, GB~Channel,high~)

where N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the transmission bandwidth
configurations according to Table 5.3.2-1 for the lowest and highest
assigned component carrier within a sub-block, respectively. SCS~low~
and SCS~high~ are the sub-carrier spacing for the lowest and highest
assigned component carrier within a sub-block, respectively. SCS~low~,
SCS~high~, N~RB,low~, N~RB,high~, GB~Channel,low~ and GB~Channel,high~
use the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing configurations
supported in the operating band for both of the channel bandwidths
according to Table 5.3.5-1. GB~Channel,low~ and GB~Channel,high~ are the
minimum guard band for the lowest and the highest assigned component
carrier according to Table 5.3.3-1 for the said *μ* value, respectively.

The sub-block gap size between two consecutive sub-blocks W~gap~ is
defined as

W~gap~ = F~edge,block\ n+1,low\ -~ F~edge,block\ n,high~ (MHz)

### 5.3A.3 RB alignment with different numerologies for CA

### 5.3A.4 UE channel bandwidth per operating band for CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation
configuration is a single operating band supporting a carrier
aggregation bandwidth class with associated bandwidth combination sets
specified in clause 5.5A.1. For each carrier aggregation configuration,
requirements are specified for all aggregated channel bandwidths
contained in a bandwidth combination set, UE can indicate support of
several bandwidth combination sets per carrier aggregation
configuration. The requirements are applicable only when Uplink CCs are
configured within the frequency range between lower edge of lowest
downlink component carrier and upper edge of highest downlink component
carrier.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation
configuration is a single operating band supporting two or more
sub-blocks, each supporting a carrier aggregation bandwidth class. The
requirements are applicable only when Uplink CCs in each UL sub-block
are configured within the frequency range between lower edge of lowest
downlink component carrier and upper edge of highest downlink component
carrier of a DL sub-block.

Frequency separation class (Fs) specified in Table 5.3A.4-2 indicates
the maximum frequency span between lower edge of lowest component
carrier and upper edge of highest component carrier that UE can support
per band in downlink or uplink (DL Fs or UL Fs) respectively in
non-contiguous intra-band operation within the bidirectional spectrum.

The DL-only frequency spectrum is the width of UE frequency spectrum
available to network to configure DL CCs only, and it extends on
one-side of the bidirectional spectrum in contiguous manner with no
frequency gap between the two. Frequency separation class for DL-only
spectrum (Fsd) specified in Table 5.3A.4-3 and is declared per band. The
frequency separation class for DL-only spectrum (Fsd) can be equal but
not larger than the frequency separation (DL Fs). The combined downlink
spectrum (DL Fs + Fsd) cannot exceed 2400 MHz. A UE may configure
DL-only spectrum only if the combined downlink spectrum (DL Fs + Fsd)
exceeds 1400 MHz. When a UE configures DL-only spectrum, it shall not
expect a CC to be configured across the boundary between bidirectional
spectrum and DL-only spectrum UE can support respectively.

For inter-band carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation configuration
is a combination of operating bands, each supporting a carrier
aggregation bandwidth class.

5.4 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 5.4.1 Channel spacing

#### 5.4.1.1 Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined as
following:

For NR operating bands with 60 kHz channel raster,

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-20
kHz, 0 kHz, 20 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 60 kHz

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-40
kHz, 0 kHz, 40 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 120 kHz

For operating band n263,

Nominal Channel spacing = ceil((BW~Channel(1)~ +
BW~Channel(2)~)/100.8)\*50.4 MHz,

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective NR carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.

### 5.4.2 Channel raster

#### 5.4.2.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster

The global frequency raster defines a set of RF reference frequencies
F~REF~. The RF reference frequency is used in signalling to identify the
position of RF channels, SS blocks and other elements.

The global frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100
GHz. The granularity of the global frequency raster is ΔF~Global~.

*RF reference frequency* is designated by an NR Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) in the range \[2016667\...3279165\] on the
global frequency raster. The relation between the NR-ARFCN and the RF
reference frequency F~REF~ in MHz is given by the following equation,
where F~REF-Offs~ and N~Ref-Offs~ are given in table 5.4.2.1-1 and
N~REF~ is the NR-ARFCN

F~REF~ = F~REF-Offs~ + ΔF~Global~ (N~REF~ -- N~REF-Offs~)

Table 5.4.2.1-1: NR-ARFCN parameters for the global frequency raster

  Frequency range (MHz)   ΔF~Global~ (kHz)   F~REF-Offs~ \[MHz\]   N~REF-Offs~   Range of N~REF~
  ----------------------- ------------------ --------------------- ------------- --------------------
  24250 -- 100000         60                 24250.08              2016667       2016667 -- 3279165

The *channel raster* defines a subset of *RF reference frequencies* that
can be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and
downlink. The *RF reference frequency* for an RF channel maps to a
resource element on the carrier. For each operating band, a subset of
frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that
band and forms a channel raster with a granularity ΔF~Raster~, which may
be equal to or larger than ΔF~Global~.

The mapping between the channel raster and corresponding resource
element is given in Clause 5.4.2.2. The applicable entries for each
operating band are defined in clause 5.4.2.3

#### 5.4.2.2 Channel raster to resource element mapping

The mapping between the RF reference frequency on channel raster and the
corresponding resource element is given in Table 5.4.2.2-1 and can be
used to identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on the
total number of RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to
both UL and DL. The mapping must apply to at least one numerology
supported by the UE.

Table 5.4.2.2-1: Channel raster to resource element mapping

  ----------------------------------------- ------------------- -------------------
                                            *N~RB~* mod 2 = 0   *N~RB~* mod 2 = 1
  Resource element index *k*                0                   6
  Physical resource block number *n~PRB~*                       
  ----------------------------------------- ------------------- -------------------

*k*, *n~RB~* , *N~RB~* are as defined in TS 38.211 \[9\].

#### 5.4.2.3 Channel raster entries for each operating band

The RF channel positions on the channel raster in each NR operating band
are given through the applicable NR-ARFCN in Table 5.4.2.3‑1, using the
channel raster to resource element mapping in clause 5.4.2.2.

\- For NR operating bands with 60 kHz channel raster above 24 GHz,
ΔF~Raster~ = *I* ×ΔF~Global~ , where *I* ϵ *{1,2}*. Every *I^th^*
NR‑ARFCN within the operating band are applicable for the channel raster
within the operating band and the step size for the channel raster in
table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as \<*I*\>.

\- In frequency bands with two ΔF~Raster~, the higher ΔF~Raster~ applies
to channels using only the SCS that equals the higher ΔF~Raster~ and the
SSB SCS that is equal to or larger than the higher ΔF~Raster~.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster

#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering

The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition
when explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not
present.

A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The
frequency position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with
corresponding number GSCN. The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN
for all the frequency ranges are in Table 5.4.3.1-1.

The resource element corresponding to the SS block reference frequency
SS~REF~ is given in clause 5.4.3.2. The synchronization raster and the
subcarrier spacing of the synchronization block is defined separately
for each band.

5.4A Channel arrangement for CA
-------------------------------

### 5.4A.1 Channel spacing for CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation with two or more component
carriers, the nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR component
carriers is defined as the following unless stated otherwise:

For NR operating bands with 60kHz channel raster:

with

*n = µ~0~ -- 2*

and for operating band n263:

Nominal Channel spacing = ceil((BW~Channel(1)~ +
BW~Channel(2)~)/100.8)\*50.4 MHz.

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective NR component carriers according to Table 5.3.2-1 with
values in MHz, μ~o~ is the largest μ value among the subcarrier spacing
configurations supported in the operating band for both of the channel
bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1, and *GB~Channel(i)~* is the
minimum guard band for channel bandwidth *i* according to Table 5.3.3-1
for the said μ value, with μ as defined in TS 38.211 \[9\].

The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel raster and
sub-carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the channel spacing
between two NR component carriers in different sub-blocks shall be
larger than the nominal channel spacing defined in this clause.5.5
Configurations

5.5A Configurations for CA
--------------------------

In the CA configuration tables of clause 5.5A.1 and clause 5.5A.2:

\- Unless otherwise noted/stated, Uplink CA configuration entries with
\"-\" mean single uplink carrier is valid for downlink intra-band CA,

In the CA configuration tables of clause 5.5A.3:

\- Uplink CA configuration entries with \"-\" mean that any valid
constituent band of the downlink inter-band CA combination can be
configured as a single uplink carrier,

\- Unless otherwise noted, all of the valid downlink constituent bands
can be configured as a single uplink carrier,

If an uplink CA configuration is supported, its fallback single uplink
is also supported.

### 5.5A.2 Configurations for intra-band non-contiguous CA

Configurations listed in this clause apply to downlink carrier
aggregation only.

NOTE: Sub-blocks belonging to a CA configuration can be in any order. In
other words certain CA configuration acronym includes all sub-block
arrangements which have exactly the same sub-block set. As an example,
CA\_n260(2G-3O) denotes CA\_n260(2O-2G-O), CA\_n260(G-3O-G) etc. but
these are not listed in tables separately.

6 Transmitter characteristics
=============================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified
over the air (OTA) with a single or multiple transmit chains.

Unless otherwise stated, for power class 3 UEs, the beam correspondence
side condition for SSB and CSI-RS specified in clause 6.6.4 shall apply
to the transmission tests.

Unless otherwise stated, the UE min peak EIRP requirements and UE
spherical coverage requirements specified in clause 6.2.1 does not apply
to initial access and RRC\_INACTIVE.

Transmitter requirements for CA operation apply only when the DMRS
initialization parameters (including the case when the UE applies cell
ID as DMRS scrambling ID) are different across all CCs. The UE may use
higher MPR values outside this limitation.

For a UE that supports \'UL full power transmission\' and is configured
to transmit a single layer with *nrofSRS-Ports* = 2, the requirements
for UL MIMO operation apply only when it is configured for any of its
declared full power modes in ul-*FullPowerTransmission-r16* (as defined
in TS 38.331\[13\]).

For a UE configured to transmit 2 layers, transmitter requirements for
UL MIMO operation apply when the UE transmits on 2 ports on the same CDM
group. The UE may use higher MPR values outside this limitation.

Transmitter requirements for simultaneous transmission to multiple
directions apply to the power classes 1, 2, 5, and 6 **only**.

The requirements for 256 QAM apply to bands defined within the frequency
spectrum range of 24.25 -- 43.5 GHz for power classes 1, 2 and 5.

#### 6.2.1.3 UE maximum output power for power class 3

The following requirements define the maximum output power radiated by
the UE for any transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth for
non-CA configuration, unless otherwise stated. The period of measurement
shall be at least one sub frame (1ms). In case of initial access and
RRC\_INACTIVE, the cumulative period of measurement shall equal or
exceed 1ms.The minimum output power values for EIRP are found in Table
6.2.1.3-1. The requirement is verified with the test metric of total
component of EIRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle). The
requirement for the UE which supports a single FR2 band is specified in
Table 6.2.1.3-1. The requirement for the UE which supports multiple FR2
bands is specified in both Table 6.2.1.3-1 and Table 6.2.1.3-4.

For power class 7 UEs that support multiple FR2 bands, minimum
requirement for peak EIRP and EIRP spherical coverage in Tables
6.2.1.7-1 and 6.2.1.7-3 shall be decreased per band, respectively, by
the peak EIRP relaxation parameter ∆MB~P,n~ and EIRP spherical coverage
relaxation parameter ∆MB~S,n~, as defined for power class 3 in Table
6.2.1.3-4.

### 6.2.2 UE maximum output power reduction

#### 6.2.2.0 General

The requirements in clause 6.2.2 only apply when both UL and DL of a UE
are configured for single CC operation, and they are of the same
bandwidth. A UE may reduce its maximum output power due to modulation
orders, transmit bandwidth configurations, waveform types and narrow
allocations. This Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) is defined in clauses
below. The allowed MPR for SRS, PUCCH formats 0, 1, 3 and 4 shall be as
specified for QPSK modulated DFT-s-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation. The
allowed MPR for PUCCH format 2 shall be as specified for QPSK modulated
CP-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation. When the maximum output power of a
UE is modified by MPR, the power limits specified in clause 6.2.4 apply.

For a UE that is configured for single CC operation with different
channel bandwidths in UL and DL, the requirements in clause 6.2A.2
apply.

For all power classes, the waveform defined by BW = 100 MHz, SCS = 120
kHz, DFT-S-OFDM QPSK, 20RB23 is the reference waveform with 0 dB MPR and
is used for the power class definition.

#### 6.2.2.1 UE maximum output power reduction for power class 1

For power class 1, MPR for contiguous allocations is defined as:

MPR = max(MPR~WT~+∆MPR, MPR~narrow~)

Where,

MPR~narrow~ = 14.4 dB, when BW~alloc,RB~ ≤ 1.44 MHz, MPR~narrow~ = 10
dB, when 1.44 MHz \< BW~alloc,RB~ ≤ 10.8 MHz, where BW~alloc,RB~ is the
bandwidth of the RB allocation size.

MPR~WT~ is the maximum power reduction due to modulation orders,
transmission bandwidth configurations listed in table 5.3.2-1, and
waveform types. MPR~WT~ is defined in Tables 6.2.2.1-1 and 6.2.2.1-2 for
FR2-1 and in Tables 6.2.2.1-3 and 6.2.2.1-4 for FR2-2.

∆MPR is due to phase noise for 256 QAM for all transmission bandwidth
configurations and defined in Table 6.2.2.1-5 for FR2-1.

#### 6.2.2.3 UE maximum output power reduction for power class 3

For power class 3, MPR for contiguous allocations is defined as:

MPR = max(MPR~WT~, MPR~narrow~)

For transmission bandwidth configuration less than or equal to 200MHz,
and 0 ≤ RB~start~ \< Ceil(1/3 N~RB~) or Ceil((2/3N~RB~)- L~CRB~) \<
RB~start~ ≤ N~RB~-L~CRB:~

> \- MPR~narrow~ = 2.5 dB, when BW~alloc,RB~ is less than or equal to
> 1.44 MHz,
>
> \- MPR~narrow~ = 2.0 dB, when 1.44 MHz \< BW~alloc,RB~ \<= 4.32 MHz,
>
> \- otherwise MPR~narrow~ = 0 dB.

MPR~WT~ is the maximum power reduction due to modulation orders,
transmission bandwidth configurations listed in Table 5.3.2-1, and
waveform types. MPR~WT~ is defined for FR2-1 in Table 6.2.2.3-1.

For power class 7, MPR specified in table 6.2.2.3-1 applies.

### 6.2.3 UE maximum output power with additional requirements

#### 6.2.3.1 General

Additional emission requirements can be signalled by the network. Each
additional emission requirement is associated with a unique network
signalling (NS) value indicated in RRC signalling by an NR frequency
band number of the applicable operating band and an associated value in
the field *additionalSpectrumEmission*. Throughout this specification,
the notion of indication or signalling of an NS value refers to the
corresponding indication of an NR frequency band number of the
applicable operating band (the IE field *freqBandIndicatorNR*) and an
associated value of *additionalSpectrumEmission* in the relevant RRC
information elements.

To meet these additional requirements, additional maximum power
reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified
in clause 6.2.1. Unless stated otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be
used.

Table 6.2.3.1-1 specifies the additional requirements with their
associated network signalling values and the allowed A-MPR and
applicable operating band(s) for each NS value. The mapping of NR
frequency band numbers and values of the *additionalSpectrumEmission* to
network signalling labels is specified in Table 6.2.3.1-2. Unless
otherwise stated, the allowed total back off is maximum of A-MPR and MPR
specified in clause 6.2.2.

that available to the reference point of a given transmitter branch that
corresponds to the reference point of the higher-layer filtered RSRP
measurement as specified in TS 38.215 \[11\].

The configured UE maximum output power P~CMAX,f,c~ for carrier *f* of a
serving cell *c* shall be set such that the corresponding measured peak
EIRP P~UMAX,f,c~ is within the following bounds

P~Powerclass~ + ∆P~IBE~ -- MAX(MAX(MPR~f,c~, A- MPR~f,c~,) + ΔMB~P,n~,
P-MPR~f,c~) -- MAX{T(MAX(MPR~f,c~, A- MPR~f,c~,)), T(P-MPR~f,c~)} ≤
P~UMAX,f,c~ ≤ EIRP~max~

while the corresponding measured total radiated power P~TMAX,f,c~ is
bounded by

P~TMAX,f,c~ ≤ TRP~max~

with P~Powerclass~ the UE minimum peak EIRP as specified in sub-clause
6.2.1, EIRP~max~ the applicable maximum EIRP as specified in sub-clause
6.2.1, MPR~f,c~ as specified in sub-clause 6.2.2 , A-MPR~f,c~ as
specified in sub-clause 6.2.3, ΔMB~P,n~ the peak EIRP relaxation as
specified in clause 6.2.1 and TRP~max~ the maximum TRP for the UE power
class as specified in sub-clause 6.2.1. ∆P~IBE~ is 1.0 dB if UE declares
support for *mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16*, UL transmission is QPSK, MPR~f,c~
= 0 and when NS\_200 applies and the network configures the UE to
operate with *mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16*otherwise ∆P~IBE~ is 0.0 dB. The
requirement is verified in beam peak direction.

*maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2,* as defined in TS 38.306 \[14\], is a UE
capability to facilitate electromagnetic power density exposure
requirements. This UE capability is applicable to all FR2 power classes.

If the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2* is present and
the percentage of uplink symbols transmitted including any PRACH
transmission within any 1 s evaluation period is larger than
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2*, the UE follows the uplink scheduling and can
apply P-MPR~f,c~.

If the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2* is absent, the
compliance to electromagnetic power density exposure requirements are
ensured by means of scaling down the power density or by other means.

P-MPR~f,c~ is the power management maximum output power reduction. The
UE shall apply P-MPR~f,c~ for carrier f of serving cell c only for the
cases described below. For UE conformance testing P-MPR~f,c~ shall be 0
dB ,  except for the testing of UL gap for Tx power management, where
P-MPR~f,c~ may be non-zero dB.

a\) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic power density
exposure requirements and addressing unwanted emissions / self desense
requirements in case of simultaneous transmissions on multiple RAT(s)
for scenarios not in scope of 3GPP RAN specifications;

b\) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic power density
exposure requirements in case of proximity detection is used to address
such requirements that require a lower maximum output power.

NOTE 1: P-MPR~f,c~ was introduced in the P~CMAX,f,c~ equation such that
the UE can report to the gNB the available maximum output transmit
power. This information can be used by the gNB for scheduling decisions.

NOTE 2: P-MPR~f,c~ and *maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2* may impact the maximum
uplink performance for the selected UL transmission path.

NOTE 3: MPE P-MPR Reporting capability *tdd-MPE-P-MPR-Reporting-r16*, as
defined in TS 38.306 \[14\], is used to report P-MPR~f,c~ when the
reporting conditions configured by gNB are met. This UE capability is
applicable to all FR2 power classes.

The tolerance T(∆P) for applicable values of ∆P (values in dB) is
specified in Tables 6.2.4-1 and 6.2.4-2.

### 6.2.5 Requirements for UL gap (*ul-GapFR2-r17*) for TX power management

The difference of the measured peak EIRP P~UMAX,f,c\_GAP\_ON~ when UL
gap for TX power management is configured and activated, and the
measured peak EIRP P~UMAX,f,c\_GAP\_OFF~ when UL gap is not configured
or de-activated, shall meet the following requirement:

P~UMAX,f,c\_GAP\_ON~ - P~UMAX,f,c\_GAP\_OFF~ $\geq$max((EIRP~meas\_peak~
-- 23) + 10 \* log10(Z/20), 3)dB

where EIRP~meas\_peak~ is the measured UE peak EIRP with zero
MPR/A-MPR/P-MPR as specified in clause 6.2.1 for the corresponding power
class, and Z% is duty cycle of the reference measurement channel.
P~UMAX,f,c\_GAP\_ON~ *shall be measured outside of the UL gap
symbol(s).* The period of measurement shall be at least 4 seconds. The
requirement is verified with the test metric of EIRP (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle) and in the test Z is set to 20 when
maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2 is less than 20 or not reported, and should be
larger than maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2 when maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2 is equal
to or greater than 20. The reference measurement channel is specified in
Annex A.2.3.

When UL gap for Tx power management is configured and activated, the
reported P-MPR~f,c~ shall be less than 3dB. When UL gap for Tx power
management is not configured and activated at the duty cycle percentage
value Z of the reference measurement channel larger than
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2*, UE shall set the P bit in PHR to 1 in the test
when PHR is configured. P-bit is defined in TS 38.321 clause 6.1.3.8 and
6.1.3.9.

6.2A Transmitter power for CA
-----------------------------

### 6.2A.1 UE maximum output power for CA

For downlink intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier
aggregation with a single uplink component carrier configured in the NR
band, the maximum output power is specified in clause 6.2.1.

For uplink intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation
for any CA bandwidth class, the maximum output power is specified in
clause 6.2.1.

For inter-band uplink CA with two NR bands with each UL band configured
with a single CC, the maximum power requirements are applicable per
band, with both carriers active with non-zero power UL RB allocation.
The maximum output power values for TRP and EIRP are applicable per
carrier and are specified in tables 6.2.1.x-2. The minimum peak values
for EIRP are defined in Tables 6.2.1.x-1 and further relaxed by
**ΔT~IB,P,n~ specified in** Table 6.2A.1-x. The peak EIRP requirements
are verified with the test metric of EIRP (Link=TX beam peak direction,
Meas=Link angle).

The inter-band ULCA spherical coverage requirement for each power class
is met if the intersection set of spherical coverage areas exceeds the
common coverage requirement for that power class. For inter-band ULCA.
the spherical coverage area for each band is the region of the sphere
measured around the UE where the measured EIRP exceeds the EIRP level
specified in Tables 6.2.1.x-3 and further reduced by the parameter
**ΔT~IB,S,n~ specified in** Table 6.2A.1-x. The intersection set of
spherical coverage areas is defined as a fraction of area of full sphere
measured around the UE where both bands meet their individual EIRP
spherical coverage requirements for inter-band CA operation. The common
coverage requirement is determined as \<100-percentile rank\> %, where
'percentile rank' is the percentile value in the specification of
spherical coverage for that power class from Tables 6.2.1.x-3. The
spherical coverage EIRP requirements are verified with the test metric
of EIRP (Link=Spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link angle).

The **ΔT~IB~** parameters are specified in tables 6.2A.1-x.

### 6.2A.2 UE maximum output power reduction for CA

#### 6.2A.2.1 General

The UE is defined to be configured for CA operation when it has at least
one of UL or DL configured for CA. In CA operation, the UE may reduce
its maximum output power due to higher order modulations and transmit
bandwidth configurations. This Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) is defined
in clauses below. The allowed MPR for SRS, PUCCH formats 0, 1, 3 and 4,
shall be as specified for QPSK modulated DFT-s-OFDM of equivalent RB
allocation. The allowed MPR for PUCCH format 2, shall be as specified
for QPSK modulated CP-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation.

When the maximum output power of a UE is modified by MPR, the power
limits specified in clause 6.2A.4 applyThe requirements in the following
clauses are applicable to the following CA configurations:

\- intra-band contiguous uplink CA, with the aggregated channel
bandwidth no greater than 800 MHz.

\- intra-band non-contiguous uplink CA with UL frequency separation no
greater than 1400 MHz, and no more than 3 sub-blocks. A sub-block may
consist of single CC or multiple contiguous CCs.

\- inter-band uplink CA with two NR bands, and each UL band is
configured with a single CC.

\- In case the CA configuration consists of a single UL CC, MPR for
contiguous UL CA applies and where necessary, BW~channel~ shall be used
as BW~channel\_CA~.

#### 6.2A.2.2 Maximum output power reduction for power class 1 

##### 6.2A.2.2.1 Maximum output power reduction for power class 1 intra-band contiguous UL CA

For power class 1, MPR for intra-band contiguous UL CA with contiguous
allocations within the cumulative aggregated bandwidth is defined as:

MPR~C\_CA~ = max(MPR~WT\_C\_CA~+∆MPR, MPR~narrow~)

Where,

MPR~narrow~ = 14.4 dB, when BW~alloc,RB~ is less than or equal to 1.44
MHz, MPR~narrow~ = 10 dB, when 1.44 MHz \< BW~alloc,RB~ ≤ 10.8 MHz,
where BW~alloc,RB~ is the bandwidth of the RB allocation size.

MPR~WT\_C\_CA~ is the maximum power reduction due to modulation orders,
transmit bandwidth configurations, and waveform types. MPR~WT\_C\_CA~ is
defined in Tables 6.2A.2.2-1 and 6.2A.2.2-2.

∆MPR for FR2-1 256 QAM as specified in Table 6.2.2.1-5 applies.

In case of a contiguous RB, DFT-s-BPSK or DFT-s-QPSK UL allocation in a
single CC of a CA configuration with contiguous CCs, and whose
cumulative aggregated BW ≤ 400 MHz, MPR~WT\_C\_CA~ shall be derived
instead as MAX(MPR~1~, MPR~2~), where:

MPR~1~ shall be determined from Table 6.2.2.1-1 if CABW ≤ 200 MHz, from
Table 6.2.2.1-2 if CABW \> 200 MHz.

MPR~2~ shall be determined from Table 6.2.2.1-1 if UL BW~channel\_CA~ ≤
200 MHz, from Table 6.2.2.1-2 if UL BW~channel\_CA~ \> 200 MHz.

and assume all UL CCs use the same SCS for the purpose of determination
of inner and outer RB allocations in Table 6.2.2.1-1 and Table
6.2.2.1-2:

N~RB~ shall be chosen as the sum of N~RB~ of all constituent UL CCs in
the CA configuration.

L~CRB~ shall be chosen as BW~alloc,RB~

RB~start~ shall be derived as:
RB~start\_allocatedCC~+N~RB\_unallocatedCC\_low~

RB~start\_allocatedCC~ is the index of the first allocated RB in the CC
with allocation

N~RB\_unallocatedCC\_low~ is the sum of N~RB~ in all UL CCs lower in
frequency compared to the CC with allocation

When different waveform types exist across CCs, the requirement is set
by the waveform type used in the configuration with the largest
MPR~C\_CA~.

For intra-band contiguous UL CA with non-contiguous RB allocations, the
following rule for MPR applies:

MPR = max(MPR~C\_CA~, -10\*A + 14.4)

Where:

A = N~RB\_alloc~ / N~RB\_agg\_C.~

N~RB\_alloc~ is the total number of allocated UL RBs

N~RB\_agg\_C~ is the number of the aggregated RBs within the fully
allocated cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth assuming lowest SCS
among all configured CCs

##### 6.2A.2.2.2 Maximum output power reduction for power class 1 intra-band non-contiguous UL CA

For intra-band non-contiguous UL CA, the following rule for MPR applies:

MPR = max(MPR~NC\_CA~+∆MPR, -10\*A + 14.4)

Where:

MPR~NC\_CA~ is derived from table 6.2A.2.2.2-1

∆MPR as specified in Table 6.2.2.1-5 applies.

A = N~RB\_alloc~ / N~RB\_agg\_C.~

N~RB\_alloc~ is the total number of allocated UL RBs

N~RB\_agg\_C~ is the number of the aggregated RBs within the fully
allocated cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth assuming lowest SCS

In case of a contiguous RB, DFT-s-BPSK or DFT-s-QPSK UL allocation in a
single CC of a CA configuration with contiguous CCs, and whose
cumulative aggregated BW ≤ 400 MHz, MPR~C\_CA~ shall be derived instead
as MAX(MPR~1~, MPR~2~), where:

MPR~1~ shall be determined from Table 6.2.2.3-1 if CABW ≤ 200 MHz, from
Table 6.2.2.3-2 if CABW \> 200 MHz.

MPR~2~ shall be determined from Table 6.2.2.3-1 if UL BW~channel\_CA~ ≤
200 MHz, from Table 6.2.2.3-2 if UL BW~channel\_CA~ \> 200 MHz.

and assume all UL CCs use the same SCS for the purpose of determination
of inner and outer RB allocations in Table 6.2.2.3-1 and Table
6.2.2.3-2:

N~RB~ shall be chosen as the sum of N~RB~ of all constituent UL CCs in
the CA configuration.

L~CRB~ shall be chosen as BW~alloc,RB~

RB~start~ shall be derived as:
RB~start\_allocatedCC~+N~RB\_unallocatedCC\_low~

RB~start\_allocatedCC~ is the index of the first allocated RB in the CC
with allocation

N~RB\_unallocatedCC\_low~ is the sum of N~RB~ in all UL CCs lower in
frequency compared to the CC with allocation

When different waveform types exist across CCs, the requirement is set
by the waveform type used in the configuration with the highest
contiguous MPR.

For intra-band contiguous UL CA with non-contiguous RB allocations, the
following rule for MPR applies:

MPR = max(MPR~C\_CA~, -10\*A +7.0)

Where:

A = N~RB\_alloc~ / N~RB\_agg\_C.~

N~RB\_alloc~ is the total number of allocated UL RBs

N~RB\_agg\_C~ is the number of the aggregated RBs within the fully
allocated cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth assuming lowest SCS
among all configured CCs

##### 6.2A.2.4.2 Maximum output power reduction for power class 3 intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous UL CA, the following rule for MPR applies:

MPR = max(MPRNC\_CA, -8\*A +10.0)

Where:

MPR~NC\_CA~ is derived from table 6.2A.2.4.2-1

A = N~RB\_alloc~ / N~RB\_agg\_C.~

N~RB\_alloc~ is the total number of allocated UL RBs

N~RB\_agg\_C~ is the number of the aggregated RBs within the fully
allocated cumulative aggregated channel bandwidth assuming lowest SCS
among all configured CCs

### 6.2A.3 UE maximum output power with additional requirements for CA

#### 6.2A.3.1 General

Additional emission requirements can be signalled by the network with
network signalling value indicated by the field
*additionalSpectrumEmission.* To meet these additional requirements,
additional maximum power reduction (A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum
output power as specified in clause 6.2A.1. Unless stated otherwise, an
A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used. Unless otherwise stated, the allowed total
back off is maximum of A-MPR and MPR specified in clause 6.2A.2.

For intra-band contiguous aggregation with the UE configured for
transmissions on two serving cells, the maximum output power reduction
specified in Table 6.2A.3.1-1 is allowed for all serving cells of the
applicable uplink contiguous CA configurations.

Table 6.2A.3.1-1 specifies the additional requirements and allowed A-MPR
with corresponding network signalling label and operating band. The
mapping between network signalling labels and the
*additionalSpectrumEmission* IE defined in TS 38.331 \[13\] is specified
in Table 6.2A.3.1-2. Unless otherwise stated, the allowed total back off
is maximum of A-MPR and MPR specified in clause 6.2A.2.

### 6.2A.4 Configured transmitted power for CA

#### 6.2A.4.1 Configured transmitted power for intra-band UL CA

A UE configured with carrier aggregation can configure its maximum
output power for each uplink activated serving cell *c* and its total
configured maximum output power P~CMAX~. The definition of the
configured UE maximum output power P~CMAX,*f,c*~ for each carrier *f* of
a serving cell *c* is used for power headroom reporting for carrier *f*
of serving cell *c* only and is in accordance with that specified in
clause 6.2.4 with parameters MPR, A-MPR and P-MPR replaced with those
specified in subclause 6.2A.2, 6.2A.3 and 6.2.4, respectively. The UE
maximum configured power P~CMAX~ in a transmission occasion is
determined by the UL grants for carriers *f* of all serving cells *c*
with non-zero granted power in the respective reference point.

For uplink intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, MPR is specified
in clause 6.2A.2. P~CMAX~ is calculated under the assumption that power
spectral density for each RB in each component carrier is same.

The configured UE maximum output power P~CMAX~ shall be set such that
the corresponding measured total peak EIRP P~UMAX~ is within the
following bounds

#### 6.2A.4.2 Configured transmitted power for inter-band UL CA

A UE can configure its maximum output power for each uplink band when it
is configured for inter-band UL carrier aggregation with two NR bands
each with a single UL CC. For each uplink band *n*, the configured UE
maximum output power P~CMAX,f,c,n~ for carrier *f* of a serving cell *c*
is defined as that available to the reference point of a given
transmitter branch that corresponds to the reference point of the
higher-layer filtered RSRP measurement as specified in TS 38.215 \[11\].

The configured UE maximum output power P~CMAX,f,c,n~ for carrier *f* of
a serving cell *c* in band *n* shall be set such that the corresponding
measured peak EIRP P~UMAX,f,c,n~ is within the following bounds

P~Powerclass~ + ∆P~IBE~ -- MAX(MAX(MPR~f,c,n~, A- MPR~f,c,n~) +
ΔT~IB,P,n~, P-MPR~f,c,n~) -- MAX{T(MAX(MPR~f,c,n~, A- MPR~f,c,n~,)),
T(P-MPR~f,c,n~)} ≤ P~UMAX,f,c,n~ ≤ EIRP~max,n~

while the corresponding measured total radiated power in uplink band
*n,* P~TMAX,f,c,n~ , is bounded by

P~TMAX,f,c,n~ ≤ TRP~max,n~

with P~Powerclass~ the UE minimum peak EIRP as specified in sub-clause
6.2A.1, EIRP~max,n~ the applicable maximum EIRP as specified in
sub-clause 6.2A.1 for uplink band *n* and TRP~max,n~ the applicable
maximum TRP as specified in sub-clause 6.2A.1 for uplink band *n*.
MPR~f,c,n~ as specified in sub-clause 6.2A.2 for uplink band *n*,
A-MPR~f,c,n~ as specified in sub-clause 6.2A.3 for uplink band *n*,
ΔT~IB,P,n~ the peak EIRP relaxation as specified in clause 6.2A.1. The
requirement is verified in beam peak direction.

∆P~IBE,~ *mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16* and *maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2* are
described in clause 6.2.4.

P-MPR~f,c,n~ is the power management maximum output power reduction
P-MPR~f,c~ in band *n.* P-MPR~f,c~ is defined in clause 6.2.4.

The tolerance T(∆P) for applicable values of ∆P (values in dB) in each
band is specified in Table 6.2.4-1.

### 6.2A.5 Requirements for UL gap (*ul-GapFR2-r17*) for TX power management in CA

The difference of the measured peak EIRP P~UMAX\_GAP\_ON~ for CA when UL
gap for TX power management is configured and activated, and the
measured peak EIRP P~UMAX\_GAP\_OFF~ when UL gap is not configured or
de-activated, shall meet the following requirement:

P~UMAX\_GAP\_ON~ - P~UMAX\_GAP\_OFF~ $\geq$ max((EIRP~meas\_peak~ -- 23)
+ 10 \* log10(Z/20), 3)dB

where EIRP~meas\_peak~ is the measured UE peak EIRP with zero
MPR/A-MPR/P-MPR in clause 6.2A.1 for the corresponding power class, and
Z% is duty cycle of the reference measurement channel.
P~UMAX,f,c\_GAP\_ON~ *shall be measured outside of the UL gap
symbol(s).* The period of measurement shall be at least 4 seconds. The
requirement is verified with the test metric of EIRP (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle) and in the test Z is set to 20 **when
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2* is less than 20 or not reported**, **and should
be larger than *maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2*** **when
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-FR2* is equal to or greater than 20,** assuming all
CCs share the same TX beam peak direction. The reference measurement
channel is specified in Annex A.2.3.

When UL gap for Tx power management is configured and activated, the
reported P-MPR~f,c~ shall be less than 3dB. When UL gap for Tx power
management is not configured and activated, UE shall set the P bit in
PHR to 1 in the test when PHR is configured. P-bit is defined in TS
38.321 clause 6.1.3.8 and 6.1.3.9.

### 6.2D.1 UE maximum output power for UL MIMO

#### 6.2D.1.0 General

The requirements in the following clauses define the maximum output
power radiated by the UE with *nrofSRS-Ports* set to 2, for any
transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth for non-CA
configuration, unless otherwise stated. MPR shall be applied as
specified in clause 6.2D.2

For the maximum output power requirement for 2-layer UL MIMO operation,
a UE shall be configured for 2-layer UL MIMO transmission as specified
in Table 6.2D.1.0-1.

For UE indicating *ul-GapFR2-r17*, UE shall meet OFF power requirement
defined in this clause for the band for which UL transmission is stopped
in the activated UL gap.

### 6.3.3 Transmit ON/OFF time mask

#### 6.3.3.1 General

The transmit ON/OFF time mask defines the transient period(s) allowed

\- between transmit OFF power and transmit ON power symbols (transmit
ON/OFF)

\- between continuous ON-power transmissions when power change or RB
hopping is applied.

In case of RB hopping, transition period is shared symmetrically.

Unless otherwise stated the minimum requirements in clause 6.5 apply
also in transient periods.

The transmit ON/OFF time mask is defined as a directional requirement.
The requirement is verified in beam locked mode at beam peak direction.
The maximum allowed EIRP OFF power level is -30dBm at beam peak
direction. The requirement is verified with the test metric of EIRP
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

In the following sub-clauses, following definitions apply:

\- A slot transmission is a Type A transmission.

\- A long subslot transmission is a Type B transmission with more than 2
symbols.

\- A short subslot transmission is a Type B transmission with 1 or 2
symbols.

#### 6.3.3.2 General ON/OFF time mask

The general ON/OFF time mask defines the observation period allowed
between transmit OFF and ON power. ON/OFF scenarios include: contiguous,
and non-contiguous transmission, etc

The OFF power measurement period is defined in a duration of at least
one slot excluding any transient periods. The ON power is defined as the
mean power over one slot excluding any transient period.

#### 6.3.3.3 Transmit power time mask for slot and short or long subslot boundaries

The transmit power time mask for slot and long subslot transmission
boundaries defines the transient periods allowed between slot and long
subslot PUSCH transmissions. For PUSCH-PUCCH and PUSCH-SRS transitions
and multiplexing the time masks in sub-clause 6.3.3.7 apply.

The transmit power time mask for slot or long subslot and short subslot
transmission boundaries defines the transient periods allowed between
slot or long subslot and short subslot transmissions. The time masks in
sub-clause 6.3.3.8 apply.

The transmit power time mask for short subslot transmission boundaries
defines the transient periods allowed between short subslot
transmissions. The time masks in sub-clause 6.3.3.9 apply.

#### 6.3.3.4 PRACH time mask

The PRACH ON power is specified as the mean power over the PRACH
measurement period excluding any transient periods as shown in Figure
6.3.3.4-1. The measurement period for different PRACH preamble format is
specified in Table 6.3.3.4-1.

### 6.3.4 Power control

#### 6.3.4.1 General

The requirements on power control accuracy apply under normal conditions
and are defined as a directional requirement. The requirements are
verified in beam locked mode on beam peak direction.

#### 6.3.4.2 Absolute power tolerance

The absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set
its initial output power to a specific value for the first sub-frame (1
ms) at the start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous
transmission with a transmission gap larger than 20 ms. The tolerance
includes the channel estimation error RSRP estimate.

The minimum requirements specified in Table 6.3.4.2-1 apply in the power
range bounded by the minimum output power as specified in sub-clause
6.3.1 (\'P~min~\') and the maximum output power as specified in
sub-clause 6.2.1 as minimum peak EIRP (\'P~max~\'). The intermediate
power point \'P~int~\' is defined in table 6.3.4.2-2

Table 6.3.4.2-1: Absolute power tolerance

  Power Range            Tolerance
  ---------------------- -----------
  P~int~ ≥ P ≥ P~min~    ± 14.0 dB
  P~max~ ≥ P \> P~int~   ± 12.0 dB

Table 6.3.4.2-2: Intermediate power point

  Power Parameter   Value
  ----------------- -------------------
  P~int~            P~max~ -- 12.0 dB

#### 6.3.4.3 Relative power tolerance

The relative power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set
its output power in a target sub-frame (1 ms) relatively to the power of
the most recently transmitted reference sub-frame (1 ms) if the
transmission gap between these sub-frames is less than or equal to 20
ms.

The minimum requirements specified in Table 6.3.4.3-1 apply when the
power of the target and reference sub-frames are within the power range
bounded by the minimum output power as defined in sub-clause 6.3.1 and
Pint as defined in sub-clause 6.3.4.2. The minimum requirements
specified in Table 6.3.4.3-2 apply when the power of the target and
reference sub-frames are within the power range bounded by Pint as
defined in sub-clause 6.3.4.2 and the measured P~UMAX~ as defined in
sub-clause 6.2.4.

For a test pattern that is either a monotonically increasing or
monotonically decreasing power sweep over the range specified for Tables
6.3.4.3-1 and 6.3.4.3-2, 3 exceptions are allowed for each of the test
patterns. For these exceptions, the power tolerance limit is a maximum
of ±11.0 dB.

#### 6.3.4.4 Aggregate power tolerance

The aggregate power control tolerance is the ability of the UE
transmitter to maintain its power in a sub-frame (1 ms) during
non-contiguous transmissions within 21ms in response to 0 dB TPC
commands with respect to the first UE transmission and all other power
control parameters as specified in 38.213 kept constant.

The minimum requirements specified in Table 6.3.4.4-1 apply when the
power of the target and reference sub-frames are within the power range
bounded by the minimum output power as defined in sub-clause 6.3.1 and
P~int~ as defined in sub-clause 6.3.4.2. The minimum requirements
specified in Table 6.3.4.4-2 apply when the power of the target and
reference sub-frames are within the power range bounded by Pint as
defined in sub-clause 6.3.4.2 and the maximum output power as specified
in sub-clause 6.2.1.

#### 6.3A.1.0 General

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the
minimum controlled output power of the UE is defined as the transmit
power of the UE per component carrier, i.e., EIRP in the channel
bandwidth of each component carrier for all transmit bandwidth
configurations (resource blocks), when the power on both component
carriers are set to a minimum value.

The minimum output power is defined as the mean power in at least one
sub frame (1ms).

transient periods. The OFF period as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 shall
only be applicable for each component carrier when all the component
carriers are OFF.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the general output
power ON/OFF time mask specified in clause 6.3.3.1 is applicable for
each CC during the ON power period and the transient periods. The OFF
period is specified in clause 6.3.3.1 for each CC separately when all
the CCs are OFF.

### 6.3A.4 Power control for CA

#### 6.3A.4.1 General

The requirements in this clause apply to a UE when it has at least one
of UL or DL configured for CA operation. The requirements on power
control accuracy in CA operation apply under normal conditions and are
defined as a directional requirement. The requirements are verified in
beam locked mode on beam peak direction. The requirements apply for one
single PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS transmission of contiguous PRB allocation per
configured UL CC with power setting in accordance with Clause 7.1 of
\[10\]

6.3A.4.2 Absolute power tolerance

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the
absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set its
initial output power to a specific value for the first sub-frame at the
start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a
transmission gap on each active component carriers larger than 20 ms.
For SRS switching, the absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE
transmitter to set its initial output power to a specific value for the
first sub-frame at the start of a contiguous transmission or
non-contiguous transmission with a transmission gap on component
carriers (to which SRS switching occurs) larger than 20 ms. The
requirement can be tested by time aligning any transmission gaps on the
component carriers. For intra-band contiguous CA, the absolute power
control tolerance per configured UL CC is given in Tables 6.3.4.2-1 and
6.3.4.2-2.

6.3A.4.3 Relative power tolerance

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the
relative power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set its
output power in a target sub-frame relative to the power of the most
recently transmitted reference sub-frame if the transmission gap between
these sub-frames is less than or equal to 20ms.

For intra-band contiguous CA, the requirements apply when the power of
the target and reference sub-frames on each component carrier exceed the
minimum output power as defined in clause 6.3A.1 and the total power is
limited by P~UMAX~ as defined in clause 6.2A.4. For the purpose of these
requirements, the power in each component carrier is specified over only
the transmitted resource blocks. The UE shall meet the requirements in
tables 6.3.4.3-1 and 6.3.4.3-2 for transmission on each assigned
component carrier, when the average PSDs over each CC are aligned with
each other in the reference sub-frame. The requirements apply per
component carrier to:

a\. All possible combinations of PUSCH and PUCCH transitions

b\. SRS and PUSCH/PUCCH transitions, only with simultaneous SRS of
constant SRS bandwidth allocated in the target and reference subrames

c\. RACH, primary component carrier

When applicable, the power step ∆P between the reference and target
subframes shall be set by a TPC command and/or an uplink scheduling
grant transmitted by means of an appropriate DCI Format.

6.3A.4.4 Aggregate power tolerance

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the
aggregate power control tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter
to maintain its power during non-contiguous transmissions within 21 ms
in response to 0 dB TPC commands with respect to the first UE
transmission and all other power control parameters as specified in
\[10\] kept constant.

For intra-band contiguous CA, the aggregate power tolerance per CC is
given in Tables 6.3.4.4.1-1 and 6.3.4.4.1-2, with simultaneous PUSCH
configured. The average PSDs over each assigned CC shall be aligned
before the start of the test. The requirement can be tested with the
transmission gaps time aligned between component carriers.

6.3D Output power dynamics for UL MIMO
--------------------------------------

### 6.3D.0 General

The requirements in subclause 6.3D shall be met with configurations
specified in sub-clause 6.2D.1.x, where 'x' depends on power class.
Unless otherwise specified, the requirements shall be verified in beam
locked mode with the test metric of EIRP (Link=TX beam peak direction,
Meas=Link angle).

### 6.3D.1 Minimum output power for UL MIMO

#### 6.3D.1.0 General

The minimum output power is defined as the mean power in at least one
sub frame (1ms). The minimum controlled output power is defined as the
EIRP, i.e. the sum of the power in the channel bandwidth for all
transmit bandwidth configurations (resource blocks), when the UE power
is set to a minimum value.

#### 6.3D.1.1 Minimum output power for UL MIMO for power class 1

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the minimum output power shall not exceed the
sum of the values specified in Table 6.3.1.1-1 and the quantity
10\*log~10~(Number of Layers).

#### 6.3D.1.2 Minimum output power for UL MIMO for power class 2, 3 and 4

minimum output power shall not exceed the sum of the values specified in
Table 6.3.1.2-1 and the quantity 10\*log~10~(Number of Layers).

#### 6.3D.1.3 Minimum output power for UL MIMO for power class 5 and 6

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the minimum controlled output power is
defined as the EIRP, i.e. the sum of the power in the channel bandwidth
for all transmit bandwidth configurations (resource blocks), when the UE
power is set to a minimum value. The minimum output power shall not
exceed the values specified in Table 6.3.1.3-1. The minimum power is
verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of EIRP (Link=TX beam
peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

### 6.3D.2 Transmit OFF power for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit OFF power is defined as the TRP
in the channel bandwidth when the transmitter is OFF. The transmitter is
considered OFF when the UE is not allowed to transmit on any of its
ports. During DTX and measurements gaps, the transmitter is not
considered OFF. The minimum output power shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.3.2-1. The requirement is verified with the test
metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

### 6.3D.3 Transmit ON/OFF time mask for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the ON/OFF time mask requirements in clause
6.3.3 apply.

6.4 Transmit signal quality
---------------------------

### 6.4.1 Frequency Error

**The UE basic measurement interval of modulated carrier frequency is 1
UL slot. The mean value of basic measurements of** UE modulated carrier
frequency shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period
of 1 msec of cumulated measurement intervals compared to the carrier
frequency received from the NR gNB.

The frequency error is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of
Frequency (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

### 6.4.2 Transmit modulation quality

#### 6.4.2.0 General

Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected
in-channel RF transmissions from the UE. The transmit modulation quality
is specified in terms of:

\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer
coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process

\- Carrier leakage

\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB

All the parameters defined in clause 6.4.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in Annex F.

All the requirements in 6.4.2 are defined as directional requirement.
The requirements are verified in beam locked mode on beam peak
direction, with parameter *maxRank* (as defined in TS 38.331 \[13\]) set
to 1. The requirements are applicable to UL transmission from each
configurable antenna port (as defined in TS 38.331 \[13\]) of UE,
enabled one at a time.

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrentList* IE (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[13\]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause
6.4.2.2 and 6.4.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard
to the carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the
calculation of transmit modulation quality.

#### 6.4.2.1 Error vector magnitude

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called
the error vector. Before calculating the EVM, the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified
in sub-clauses 6.4.2.4 and 6.4.2.5. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the EVM
result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of
the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after
the front-end FFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error
vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %.

The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble
sequence for the PRACH and one slot for PUCCH and PUSCH in the time
domain. The EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols that
contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval as as
defined in clause 6.3.3.

The RMS average of the basic EVM measurements over 10 subframes for the
average EVM case, and over 60 subframes for the reference signal EVM
case, for the different modulation schemes shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.4.2.1-1 for the parameters defined in Table
6.4.2.1-2 or 6.4.2.1-3, depending on UE power class. For EVM evaluation
purposes, all 13 PRACH preamble formats and all 5 PUCCH formats are
considered to have the same EVM requirement as QPSK modulated.

The requirement is verified with the test metric of EVM (Link=TX beam
peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

#### 6.4.2.2 Carrier leakage

##### 6.4.2.2.1 General

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform. The carrier leakage
requirement is defined for each component carrier. The measurement
interval is one slot in the time domain. The relative carrier leakage
power is a power ratio of the additive sinusoid waveform to the power in

the UE output power in a non--allocated RB to the UE output power in an
allocated RB. The IBE requirement does not apply if UE declares support
for *mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16,* UL transmission is QPSK,MPR~f,c~ = 0 and
when NS\_200 applies, and the network configures the UE to operate with
*mpr-PowerBoost-FR2-r16.*

The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is identical to that of
the EVM test.

The requirement is verified with the test metric of In-band emission
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

##### 6.4.2.3.2 In-band emissions for power class 1

The average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall
not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3.2-1 for power class 1
UEs.

##### 6.4.2.3.7 In-band emissions for power class 6

For power class 6, the in-band emissions requirement specified in clause
6.4.2.3.6 for power class 5 applies.

##### 6.4.2.3.8 In-band emissions for power class 7

The average of the in-band emission specified in subclause 6.4.2.3.4
applies.

#### 6.4.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

The EVM measurement process (as described in Annex F) entails generation
of a zero-forcing equalizer. The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is
defined in terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple of the equalizer
coefficients (dB) across the allocated uplink block. The basic
measurement interval is the same as for EVM.

For Pi/2 BPSK modulation, the minimum requirements are defined in Clause
6.4.2.5.

The peak-to-peak variation of the EVM equalizer coefficients contained
within the frequency range of the uplink allocation shall not exceed the
maximum ripple specified in Table 6.4.2.4-1 for normal conditions. For
uplink allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the
coefficients evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet
the corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional
requirements: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in
Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 (Table 6.4.2.4-1) must
not be larger than 7 dB, and the relative difference between the maximum
coefficient in Range 2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not
be larger than 8 dB (see Figure 6.4.2.4-1).

The requirement is verified with the test metric of EVM SF (Link=TX beam
peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

#### 6.4.2.6 Phase continuity requirements for DMRS bundling

For bands that UE indicates the support of DMRS bundling, when the UE is
configured with DMRS bundling, the maximum allowable difference between
the measured phase value in any slot *p-1* and slot *p* shall satisfy
the requirements as listed in Table 6.4.2.6-1 for the measurement
conditions defined in Table 6.4.2.6-2, within a measurement time window
limited by the UE capability of maximum duration for DMRS bundling
\[maxDurationDMRS-Bundling-r17\], and defined for each frequency band
separately. The phase value for each slot is measured as shown in Annex
F.8. These requirements apply to PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions with
DFT-s-OFDM and CP-OFDM waveforms.

6.4A Transmit signal quality for CA
-----------------------------------

### 6.4A.0 General

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation,
**the** requirements in this clause apply if the UE has at least one of
UL or DL configured for CA.

### 6.4A.1 Frequency error

The requirements in this clause apply to UEs of all power classes.

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, **the
UE basic measurement interval of modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL
slot. The mean value of basic measurements of** UE modulated carrier
frequencies per band shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over
a period of 1ms of cumulated measurement intervals compared to the
carrier frequency of primary component carrier received from the gNB.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the frequency error
requirement is specified in clause 6.4.1 and is applicable for each CC
with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB allocation.

The frequency error is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode on beam peak direction.

### 6.4A.2 Transmit modulation quality

#### 6.4A.2.0 General

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the
requirements in clauses 6.4A.2.1, 6.4A.2.2, and 6.4A.2.3 apply.

All the parameters defined in clause 6.4A.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in Annex F.

All the requirements in 6.4A.2 are defined as directional requirement.
The requirements are verified in beam locked mode on beam peak
direction.

The carrier leakage frequency is optionally indicated with IE
*UplinkTxDirectCurrentList, UplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrierList-r16 for
CA with two component carriers configured for uplink or* IE
*UplinkTxDirectCurrentMoreCarrierList-r17 for any CA configuration.*

If the UE does not indicate DC location parameters, the carrier leakage
measurement requirement in clauses 6.4A.2.2 and 6.4A.2.3 shall be waived
and the UE's UL signal left uncorrected for carrier leakage. Any
requirement relaxation to accommodate the IQ image shall be omitted.

If the UE indicates carrier leakage frequency as 3300 or 3301 with IE
*UplinkTxDirectCurrentList or UplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrierList-r16,*
or if the *carrier leakage frequency is outside the configured UL and DL
carriers, t*he carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause
6.4A.2.2 and 6.4A.2.3 shall be waived and the UE's UL signal left
uncorrected for carrier leakage. Any requirement relaxation to
accommodate the IQ image shall be omitted.

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the UE
is defined to be configured for CA operation when it has at least one of
UL or DL configured for CA.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the transmit modulation
quality requirements are specified in clause 6.4.2 and are applicable
for each CC with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB allocation.

#### 6.4A.2.1 Error Vector magnitude

The requirements in this clause apply to UEs of all power classes. For
intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the Error
Vector Magnitude requirement of clause 6.4.2.2 is defined for each
component carrier. Requirements only apply with PRB allocation in one of
the component carriers. Similar transmitter impairment removal
procedures are applied for CA waveform before EVM calculation as is
specified for non-CA waveform.

#### 6.4A.2.2 Carrier leakage

##### 6.4A.2.2.1 General

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform. The carrier leakage
requirement is defined for each component carrier and is measured on the
component carrier with PRBs allocated. The measurement interval is one
slot in the time domain.

Note: When UE has DL configured for intra-band non-contiguous CA,
indicated carrier leakage may land outside the spectrum occupied by all
configured UL and DL CC. In this case the requirement does not apply.

The relative carrier leakage power is a power ratio of the additive
sinusoid waveform and the modulated waveform. The requirement is
verified with the test metric of Carrier Leakage (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle).

##### 6.4A.2.2.2 Carrier leakage for power class 1

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, when
carrier leakage is contained inside the spectrum occupied by all
configured UL and DL CCs, the relative carrier leakage power shall not
exceed the values specified in Table 6.4A.2.2.2-1 and Table 6.4A.2.2.2-2

##### 6.4A.2.3.3 Inband emissions for power class 2

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the
average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not
exceed the values specified in Table 6.4A.2.3.3-1 for power class 2.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the in-band emissions
requirements are specified in clause 6.4.2.3.3 and are applicable for
each CC with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB allocation.

##### 6.4A.2.3.4 Inband emissions for power class 3

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the
average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not
exceed the values specified in Table 6.4A.2.3.4-1 for power class 3 UEs.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the in-band emissions
requirements are specified in clause 6.4.2.3.4 and are applicable for
each CC with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB allocation.

##### 6.4A.2.3.6 Inband emissions for power class 5

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the
average of the in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not
exceed the values specified in Table 6.4A.2.3.6-1 for power class 6 UEs.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the in-band emissions
requirements are specified in clause 6.4.2.3.6 and are applicable for
each CC with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB allocation.

##### 6.4A.2.3.7 Inband emissions for power class 6

For intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the
average of the in-band emission specified in clause 6.4A.2.3.6 applies

#### 6.4A.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the EVM equalizer
spectrum flatness requirements are specified in clause 6.4.2.4 and are
applicable for each CC with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB
allocation.

----------------------------------------

### 6.4D.0 General

references to sub-clauses 6.3.1.x in clause 6.4 redirected to
sub-clauses 6.3D.1.x, where 'x' depends on power class. The requirements
apply when the UE is configured for 2-layer UL MIMO transmission as
specified in Table 6.2D.1.0-1.

The requirement may alternatively be verified in each of the single
layer UL MIMO configurations as specified in Table 6.4D.0-1. In this
case, the transmit modulation quality requirements in clause 6.4 apply
without modification.

quality tests

### 6.4D.1 Frequency error for UL MIMO

For a UE supporting UL MIMO, **the UE basic measurement interval of
modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL slot. The mean value of basic
measurements of** UE modulated carrier frequency at each layer shall be
accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period of 1ms of cumulated
measurement intervals compared to the carrier frequency received from
the NR Node B.

### 6.4D.2 Transmit modulation quality for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality requirements
are specified per layer in terms of:

Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)

EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer coefficients
generated by the EVM measurement process

Carrier leakage (caused by IQ offset)

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality requirements
are specified as the total component of EIRP in terms of: In-band
emissions for the non-allocated RB

The requirements are defined as directional requirements. The
requirements are verified in beam locked mode in the TX beam peak
direction (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrentList* IE (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[13\]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause
6.4D.2.2 and 6.4D.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard
to the carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the
calculation of transmit modulation quality.

### 6.4D.3 Time alignment error for UL MIMO

For a UE with multiple physical antenna ports supporting UL MIMO, this
requirement applies to frame timing differences between transmissions on
multiple physical antenna ports in the codebook transmission scheme.

The time alignment error (TAE) is defined as the average frame timing
difference between any two transmissions on different physical antenna
ports.

For a UE with multiple physical antenna ports, the Time Alignment Error
(TAE) shall not exceed 130 ns.

### 6.4D.4 Requirements for coherent UL MIMO

For coherent UL MIMO, Table 6.4D.4-1 lists the maximum allowable
difference between the measured relative power and phase errors between
different physical antenna ports in any slot within the specified time
window from the last transmitted SRS on the same antenna ports, for the
purpose of uplink transmission (codebook or non-codebook usage) and
those measured at that last SRS. The requirements in Table 6.4D.4-1
apply when the UL transmission power at each physical antenna port is
larger than 0 dBm for SRS transmission and for the duration of time
window. The requirement is verified with the test metric of EIRP
(Link=TX Beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

Table 6.4D.4-1: Maximum allowable difference of relative phase and power
errors in a given slot compared to those measured at last SRS
transmitted

  Difference of relative phase error   Difference of relative power error   Time window
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ -------------
  40 degrees                           4 dB                                 20 msec

The above requirements apply when all of the following conditions are
met within the specified time window:

\- UE is not signaled with a change in number of SRS ports in
*SRS-config*, or a change in *PUSCH-config*

\- UE remains in DRX active time (UE does not enter DRX OFF time)

\- No measurement gap occurs

\- No instance of SRS transmission with the usage antenna switching
occurs

\- Active BWP remains the same

\- EN-DC and CA configuration is not changed for the UE (UE is not
configured or de-configured with PScell or SCell(s))

6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
--------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth

Occupied bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth containing 99 % of the
total integrated mean power of the transmitted spectrum on the assigned
channel. The occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations (Resources Blocks) shall be less than the channel
bandwidth specified in Table 6.5.1-1.

The occupied bandwidth is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of OBW
(Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

### 6.5.2 Out of band emissions

#### 6.5.2.0 General

The Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
assigned channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission
mask and an adjacent channel leakage power ratio. Additional
requirements to protect specific bands are also considered.

The requirements in clause 6.5.2.1 only apply when both UL and DL of a
UE are configured for single CC operation, and they are of the same
bandwidth. For a UE that is configured for single CC operation with
different channel bandwidths in UL and DL, the requirements in clause
6.5A.2.1 apply.

All out of band emissions for frequency range 2 are TRP.

#### 6.5.2.1 Spectrum emission mask

The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~)
starting from the ± edge of the assigned NR channel bandwidth. For
frequencies offset greater than F~OOB~ as specified in Table 6.5.2.1-1
the spurious requirements in clause 6.5.3 are applicable.

The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in
Table 6.5.2.1-1 for the specified channel bandwidth. The requirement is
verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam
peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

Table 6.5.2.1-1: General NR spectrum emission mask for frequency range
2.

#### 6.5.2.2 Void

#### 6.5.2.3 Adjacent channel leakage ratio

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. ACLR requirement is
specified for a scenario in which adjacent carrier is another NR
channel**.**

NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal
channel spacing. The assigned NR channel power and adjacent NR channel
power are measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths
specified in Table 6.5.2.3-1 for FR2-1 and in Table 6.5.2.3-2 for FR2-2.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than --35 dBm then the
NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5.2.3-1.
The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of
TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).

### 6.5.3 Spurious emissions

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions unless otherwise stated. The spurious emission
limits are specified in terms of general requirements in line with
SM.329 \[7\] and NR operating band requirement to address UE
co-existence. Spurious emissions are measured as TRP.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3-1
starting from the edge of the assigned NR channel bandwidth. The
spurious emission limits in Table 6.5.3-2 apply for all transmitter band
configurations (NRB) and channel bandwidths. The requirement is verified
in beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=TRP grid).

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

#### 6.5.3.1 Spurious emission band UE co-existence

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified NR band, for
coexistence with protected bands.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

#### 6.5.3.2 Additional spurious emissions

##### 6.5.3.2.1 General

These requirements are specified in terms of an additional spurious
emission requirement. Additional spurious emission requirements are
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet an
additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the
cell handover/broadcast message.

6.5A Output RF spectrum emissions for CA
----------------------------------------

### 6.5A.1 Occupied bandwidth for CA

#### 6.5A.1.0 General

The occupied bandwidth for UL CA is defined as a directional
requirement. The requirement is verified in beam locked mode on beam
peak direction. In case the intra-band CA configuration consists of a
single UL CC, the occupied bandwidth requirement defined in subclause
6.5.1 applies.

#### 6.5A.1.1 Occupied bandwidth for intra-band contiguous UL CA

For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the occupied bandwidth
is a measure of the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total integrated
power of the transmitted spectrum. The occupied bandwidth for UL CA
shall be less than the UL aggregated channel bandwidth defined in clause
5.3A.

#### 6.5A.1.2 Occupied bandwidth for intra-band non-contiguous UL CA

For intra-band non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the occupied
bandwidth requirement is met when the ratio of the transmitted power in
all sub-blocks of the UL CA configuration to the total integrated power
of the transmitted spectrum is greater than 99%.

#### 6.5A.1.3 Occupied bandwidth for inter-band UL CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the occupied bandwidth
requirements is specified in clause 6.5.1 and is applicable for each CC
with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB allocation.

### 6.5A.2 Out of band emissions

#### 6.5A.2.1 Spectrum emission mask for CA

##### 6.5A.2.1.0 General

For intra-band CA, the requirements specified in this clause shall apply
if the UE has at least one of UL or DL configured for CA or if the UE is
configured for single CC operation with different channel bandwidths in
UL and DL carriers. In case the CA configuration consists of a single UL
CC, spectrum emission mask defined in subclause 6.5.2.1 applies.
Spectral emission mask requirements do not apply at any frequency where
IBE requirements of clause 6.4A.2.3 apply.

The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the test metric of
TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction).

##### 6.5A.2.1.1 Spectrum emission mask for intra-band contiguous UL CA

For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spectrum emission
mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~) starting from the ± edge
of the UL aggregated channel bandwidth (Table 5.3A.4-1). For any
bandwidth class defined in Table 5.3A.4-1, the UE emission shall not
exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5A.2.1.1-1.

##### 6.5A.2.1.2 Spectrum emission mask for intra-band non-contiguous UL CA

For intra-band non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spectrum
emission mask requirement is defined as a composite spectrum emissions
mask. Composite spectrum emission mask applies to frequencies up to ±
Δf~OOB~ starting from the edge of each UL sub-block. Composite spectrum
emission mask is defined as follows:

a\) Composite spectrum emission mask is a combination of individual
spectrum emissions masks defined for each sub-block. If for some
frequency, spectrum emission masks from multiple sub-blocks overlap, the
spectrum emission mask allowing the highest power spectral density
applies for that frequency

b\) In case a sub-block comprises of multiple component carriers, the
spectrum emissions mask is defined in subclause 6.5A.2.1.1 or in case of
a single component carrier, the sub-block spectrum emission mask is
defined in subclause 6.5.2.1

c\) If for some frequency the spectrum emission mask of one sub-block
overlaps another sub-block, the emission mask does not apply for that
frequency.

d\) If carrier leakage or I/Q image lands inside the spectrum occupied
by the configured UL and DL CCs, exception to the general spectrum
emission mask limit applies. For carrier leakage the requirements
specified in section 6.4A.2.2 shall apply. For I/Q image the
requirements specified in section 6.4A.2.3 shall apply.

##### 6.5A.2.1.3 Spectrum emission mask for inter-band UL CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the spectrum emission
mask is specified in Table 6.5.2.1-1 for each CC separately while both
CCs are active with non-zero UL RB allocation. If for some frequency
spectrum emission masks of CCs overlap, then spectrum emission mask
allowing higher power spectral density applies for that frequency. If
for some frequency a CC spectrum emission mask overlaps with the channel
bandwidth of another CC, then the emission mask does not apply for that
frequency.

#### 6.5A.2.2 Void

#### 6.5A.2.3 Adjacent channel leakage ratio for CA

##### 6.5A.2.3.1 Adjacent channel leakage ratio for CA intra-band contiguous UL CA

In case the CA configuration consists of a single UL CC, the adjacent
channel leakage ratio defined in subclause 6.5.2.3 applies. For
intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the carrier aggregation NR
adjacent channel leakage power ratio (CA NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the UL aggregated channel bandwidth to
the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent UL aggregated channel
bandwidth at spacing equal to the UL aggregated channel bandwidth. The
assigned UL aggregated channel bandwidth power and adjacent UL
aggregated channel bandwidth power are measured with rectangular filters
with measurement bandwidths specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-1. If the
measured adjacent channel power is greater than -35 dBm then the CA
NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-1.

##### 6.5A.2.3.2 Adjacent channel leakage ratio for CA intra-band non-contiguous UL CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, adjacent channel
leakage power ratio (CA NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the sum of the
filtered mean powers centred on each sub-block bandwidth to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent sub-block frequency at nominal spacing
equal to the sub-block bandwidth. The power in the configured UL CCs and
power in the sub-block bandwidth adjacent to each sub-block of
configured UL CCs are measured with rectangular filters with measurement
bandwidths specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-2. In case a sub-block consists
of a single component carrier, the measurement bandwidths and adjacent
frequency offset from subclause 6.5.2.3 shall be used. If the measured
adjacent sub-block power is greater than -35 dBm then the CA NR~ACLR~
shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5A.2.3.1-2.

No requirement applies in the gap between neighbouring sub-blocks if the
frequency span between the lowest edge of the upper sub-block and the
highest edge of the lower sub-block is smaller than the bandwidth of
either sub-block.

##### 6.5A.2.3.3 Adjacent channel leakage ratio for CA inter-band UL CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the NR Adjacent Channel
Leakage power Ratio (NR~ACLR~) is applicable for each CC while both CCs
are active with non-zero UL RB allocation and the requirement is
specified in clause 6.5.2.3.

### 6.5A.3 Spurious emissions for CA

#### 6.5A.3.0 General spurious emissions for CA

##### 6.5A.3.0.0 General 

This clause specifies the spurious emission requirements for carrier
aggregation. The requirement is verified in beam locked mode with the
test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction).

For intra-band CA, in case the CA configuration consists of a single UL
CC, spurious emissions requirements defined in subclause 6.5.3 apply.
Spurious emissions requirements do not apply at any frequency where IBE
requirements of clause 6.4A.2.3 apply.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

##### 6.5A.3.0.1 Spurious emissions for intra-band contiguous UL CA

For intra-band contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spurious emission
limits apply for the frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz)
from the edge of the UL aggregated channel bandwidth, where F~OOB~ is
defined as the twice the UL aggregated channel bandwidth. For
frequencies Δf~OOB~ greater than F~OOB~, the spurious emission
requirements in Table 6.5.3-2 are applicable.

##### 6.5A.3.0.2 Spurious emissions for intra-band non-contiguous UL CA

For intra-band non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation, the spurious
emission requirement is defined as a composite spurious emission
requirement which is a combination of individual spurious emission
requirements defined for each UL sub-block. The limits in Table 6.5.3-2
apply for the frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) from the
edge of each UL sub-block but excludes frequency ranges that coincide
with another UL sub-block. No spurious emission limit applies in the gap
between neighbouring UL sub-blocks if the frequency span between the
lowest edge of the upper sub-block and the highest edge of the lower
sub-block is smaller than F~OOB\_L~ + F~OOB\_H~.

##### 6.5A.3.0.3 Spurious emissions for inter-band UL CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, the spurious emission
requirements are specified in clause 6.5.3 and are applicable for each
CC with all CCs active with non-zero UL RB allocation.

#### 6.5A.3.1 Spurious emission band UE co-existence for UL CA

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified contiguous or
non-contiguous UL carrier aggregation configurations for coexistence
with protected bands.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

For intra-band contiguous, non-contiguous carrier aggregation and
inter-band carrier aggregation, the requirements in Table 6.5A.3-1
apply.

#### 6.5A.3.2 Additional spurious emissions

##### 6.5A.3.2.1 General

These requirements are specified in terms of an additional spectrum
emission requirement. Additional spurious emission requirements are
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet an
additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the
cell handover/broadcast message.

##### 6.5A.3.2.2 Void

##### 6.5A.3.2.3 Additional spurious emission requirements for CA\_NS\_202

When \"CA\_NS\_202\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE
emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5.3.2.3-1.

##### 6.5A.3.2.4 Additional spurious emission requirements for CA\_NS\_203

When \"CA\_NS\_203\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE
emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5.3.2.4-1.
This requirement also applies for the frequency ranges that are less
than F~OOB~ (MHz) as defined in section 6.5A.3.

6.5D Output RF spectrum emissions for UL MIMO
---------------------------------------------

### 6.5D.1 Occupied bandwidth for UL MIMO

For UE(s) supporting UL MIMO, the occupied bandwidth requirement in
clause 6.5.1 apply. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO
configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1.0-1.

### 6.5D.2 Out of band emissions for UL MIMO

For UE(s) supporting UL MIMO, the out of band emissions requirements in
clause 6.5.2 apply. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO
configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1.0-1.

### 6.5D.3 Spurious emissions for UL MIMO

For UE(s) supporting UL MIMO, the spurious emissions requirements in
clause 6.5.3 apply. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO
configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1.0-1.

6.6 Beam correspondence
-----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Beam correspondence is the ability of the UE to select a suitable beam
for UL transmission based on DL measurements with or without relying on
UL beam sweeping. Unless explicitly addressed in subclauses below, the
beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE meets the
corresponding minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirement for
that power class with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without
uplink beam sweeping.

### 6.6.2 Beam correspondence for power class 1

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 1 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE consists of UE spherical coverage only:

\- UE shall meet the spherical coverage requirement for initial access
and RRC\_INACTIVE according to Table 6.2.1.1-3, with its autonomously
chosen UL beams and without uplink beam sweeping, using the side
conditions for initial access and in RRC\_INACTIVE as defined in Clause
6.6.2.3.4.

#### 6.6.2.2 (Void)

#### 6.6.2.3 Side Conditions

##### 6.6.2.3.1 (Void)

##### 6.6.2.3.2 (Void)

##### 6.6.2.3.3 (Void)

##### 6.6.2.3.4 Side Condition for Beam Correspondence requirements in initial access and RRC\_INACTIVE

The beam correspondence requirements are only applied under the
following side conditions:

\- The downlink reference signal SSB is provided, and CSI-RS is not
provided.

\- For beam correspondence, conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are
fulfilled according to Table 6.6.2.3.4-1.

#### 6.6.2.4 Applicability

For the beam correspondence requirement for power class 1 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE, the following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets beam correspondence requirements in initial access, it
is considered to have met the beam correspondence requirements in
RRC\_INACTIVE.

### 6.6.3 (Void)

### 6.6.4 Beam correspondence for power class 3

#### 6.6.4.1 General

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 3 UEs in
RRC\_CONNECTED consists of three components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as
defined in Clause 6.2.1.3), UE spherical coverage (as defined in Clause
6.2.1.3), and beam correspondence tolerance (as defined in Clause
6.6.4.2). The beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE
satisfies one of the following conditions, depending on the UE\'s beam
correspondence capability IE *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*,
as defined in TS 38.306 \[14\]:

UEs supporting FR2-2 shall support
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping.*

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is supported, the UE
shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.3-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.3-3 with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink beam
sweeping. Such a UE is considered to have met the beam correspondence
tolerance requirement.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-1 and spherical
coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-3 using the side
conditions for SSB based enhanced beam correspondence requirements as
defined in Clause 6.6.4.3.2.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet
the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-3 using the
side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.4.3.3.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present, the UE
shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.3-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.3-3 with uplink beam sweeping. Such a UE shall meet the beam
correspondence tolerance requirement defined in Clause 6.6.4.2 and shall
support uplink beam management, as defined in TS 38.306 \[14\].

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present and
*beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16* is supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-1 and spherical
coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-3 with uplink beam
sweeping using the side conditions for SSB based enhanced beam
correspondence requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.4.3.2. Such a UE
shall meet the beam correspondence tolerance requirement defined in
Clause 6.6.4.2 and shall support uplink beam management, as defined in
TS 38.306 \[14\].

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present and
*beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16* is supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-1 and spherical
coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.3-3 with uplink beam
sweeping using the side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.4.3.3. Such a UE
shall meet the beam correspondence tolerance requirement defined in
Clause 6.6.4.2 and shall support uplink beam management, as defined in
TS 38.306 \[14\].

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 3 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE consists of UE spherical coverage only:

\- UE shall meet the spherical coverage requirement for initial access
and RRC\_INACTIVE according to Table 6.2.1.3-3, with its autonomously
chosen UL beams and without uplink beam sweeping, using the side
conditions for initial access and in RRC\_INACTIVE as defined in Clause
6.6.4.3.4.

#### 6.6.4.2 Beam correspondence tolerance for power class 3

The beam correspondence tolerance requirement ∆EIRP~BC~ for power class
3 UEs is defined based on a percentile of the distribution of ∆EIRP~BC~,
defined as ∆EIRP~BC~ = EIRP~2~ - EIRP~1~ over the link angles spanning a
subset of the spherical coverage grid points, such that

\- EIRP~1~ is the total EIRP in dBm calculated based on the beam the UE
chooses autonomously (corresponding beam) to transmit in the direction
of the incoming DL signal, which is based on beam correspondence without
relying on UL beam sweeping.

\- EIRP~2~ is the best total EIRP (beam yielding highest EIRP in a given
direction) in dBm which is based on beam correspondence with relying on
UL beam sweeping.

\- The link angles are the ones corresponding to the top N^th^
percentile of the EIRP~2~ measurement over the whole sphere, where the
value of N is according to the test point of EIRP spherical coverage
requirement for power class 3, i.e. N = 50.

For power class 3 UEs, the requirement is fulfilled if the UE\'s
corresponding UL beams satisfy the maximum limit in Table 6.6.4.2-1.

##### 6.6.4.3.4 Side Condition for Beam Correspondence requirements in initial access and RRC\_INACTIVE

The beam correspondence requirements for beam correspondence in initial
access and RRC\_INACTIVE are only applied under side conditions in
Clause 6.6.4.3.2.

#### 6.6.4.4 Applicability

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence in
RRC\_CONNECTED, the following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements either based
on SSB or based on CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the beam
correspondence requirements based on SSB and CSI-RS.

\- For a UE supporting either SSB based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet the supported enhanced beam
correspondence requirements.

\- For a UE supporting both SSB based and CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet both SSB based and CSI-RS based
enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the following
applicability rules for verifying the requirements apply:

\- The enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be verified with
the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions in clause
6.6.4.3.2. If the UE meets the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements using the side conditions in clause 6.6.4.3.2 and meets the
minimum peak EIRP requirement as defined in clause 6.2.1.3 using the
CSI-RS based side conditions in clause 6.6.4.3.3, where the link
direction is determined in the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
test, the UE is considered to have met both the SSB based and CSI-RS
based enhanced beam correspondence requirements.

\- Otherwise, if UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement as
defined in clause 6.2.1.3 using the CSI-RS based side conditions in
clause 6.6.4.3.3, the enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be
further verified for the UE with the CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence side conditions in clause 6.6.4.3.3.

For the beam correspondence requirement for power class 3 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE, the following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets beam correspondence requirements in initial access, it
is considered to have met the beam correspondence requirements in
RRC\_INACTIVE.

### 6.6.5 (Void)

### 6.6.6 Beam correspondence for power class 5

#### 6.6.6.1 General

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 5 UEs consists of
two components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.5), and
UE spherical coverage (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.5). The beam
correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the UE satisfies one of the
following conditions, depending on the UE\'s beam correspondence
capability IE *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*, as defined in
TS 38.306 \[14\]:

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is supported, the UE
shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.5-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.5-3 with its autonomously chosen UL beams and without uplink beam
sweeping. Such a UE is considered to have met the beam correspondence
tolerance requirement.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet the
minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.5-1 and spherical
coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.5-3 using the side
conditions for SSB based enhanced beam correspondence requirements as
defined in Clause 6.6.6.3.2.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16* are supported, the UE shall meet
the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.5-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.5-3 using the
side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.6.3.3.

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 5 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE consists of UE spherical coverage only:

\- UE shall meet the spherical coverage requirement for initial access
and RRC\_INACTIVE according to Table 6.2.1.5-3, with its autonomously
chosen UL beams and without uplink beam sweeping, using the side
conditions for initial access and in RRC\_INACTIVE as defined in Clause
6.6.6.3.4.

#### 6.6.6.2 (Reserved)

*Editor's note: FFS if power class 5 UE can rely on UL beam sweeping to
meet min peak EIRP and spherical requirements.*

#### 6.6.6.3 Side Conditions

##### 6.6.6.3.1 Side Condition for beam correspondence based on SSB and CSI-RS

The beam correspondence requirements are only applied under the
following side conditions:

\- The downlink reference signals including both SSB and CSI-RS are
provided and Type D QCL shall be maintained between SSB and CSI-RS.

\- The reference measurement channel for beam correspondence is
fulfilled according to the CSI-RS configuration in Annex A.3.

\- For beam correspondence, conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are
fulfilled according to Table 6.6.6.3.1-1 and Table 6.6.6.3.1-2.

##### 6.6.6.3.4 Side Condition for Beam Correspondence requirements in initial access and RRC\_INACTIVE

The beam correspondence requirements for beam correspondence in initial
access and RRC\_INACTIVE are only applied under side conditions in
Clause 6.6.6.3.2.

#### 6.6.6.4 Applicability

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the
following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements either based
on SSB or based on CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the beam
correspondence requirements based on SSB and CSI-RS.

\- For a UE supporting either SSB based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet the supported enhanced beam
correspondence requirements.

\- For a UE supporting both SSB based and CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet both SSB based and CSI-RS based
enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the following
applicability rules for verifying the requirements apply:

\- The enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be verified with
the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions in clause
6.6.6.3.2. If UE meets the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements using the side conditions in clause 6.6.6.3.2 and meets the
minimum peak EIRP requirement as defined in clause 6.2.1.5 using the
CSI-RS based side conditions in clause 6.6.6.3.3, where the link
direction is determined in the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
test, the UE is considered to have met both the SSB based and CSI-RS
based enhanced beam correspondence requirements.

\- Otherwise, if UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement as
defined in clasue 6.2.1.3 using the CSI-RS based side conditions in
clause 6.6.6.3.3, the enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be
further verified for the UE with the CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence side conditions in clause 6.6.6.3.3.

For the beam correspondence requirement for power class 5 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE, the following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets beam correspondence requirements in initial access, it
is considered to have met the beam correspondence requirements in
RRC\_INACTIVE.

### 6.6.7 Beam correspondence for power class 6

#### 6.6.7.1 General

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 6 UEs in
RRC\_CONNECTED consists of two components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as
defined in Clause 6.2.1.6), and UE spherical coverage (as defined in
Clause 6.2.1.6).

Power class 6 UE shall mandatorily support
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* and
*beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16.* The UE shall meet the minimum peak
EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.6-1 and spherical coverage
requirement according to Table 6.2.1.6-3 using the side conditions for
SSB based enhanced beam correspondence requirements as defined in Clause
6.6.7.3.2.

If the UE also support *beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16,* the UE
shall also meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table
6.2.1.6-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.6-3 using the side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.7.3.3.

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 6 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE consists of UE spherical coverage only:

\- UE shall meet the spherical coverage requirement for initial access
and RRC\_INACTIVE according to Table 6.2.1.6-3, with its autonomously
chosen UL beams and without uplink beam sweeping, using the side
conditions for initial access and in RRC\_INACTIVE as defined in Clause
6.6.7.3.4.

#### 6.6.7.2 (Void)

*Editor's note: Not need to define beam correspondence tolerance
requirement because power class 6 UE shall mandatorily support
beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping.*

#### 6.6.7.3 Side Conditions

##### 6.6.7.3.1 (Void)

*Editor's note: Not need to define the side condition for beam
correspondence based on SSB and CSI-RS, because power class 6 UE shall
mandatorily support SSB based enhanced beam correspondence.*

##### 6.6.7.3.2 Side Condition for SSB based enhanced Beam Correspondence requirements

The beam correspondence requirements for beam correspondence based on
SSB are only applied under the following side conditions:

\- The downlink reference signal SSB is provided, and CSI-RS is not
provided.

\- For beam correspondence, conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are
fulfilled according to Table 6.6.7.3.2-1.

##### 6.6.7.3.4 Side Condition for Beam Correspondence requirements in initial access and RRC\_INACTIVE

The beam correspondence requirements for beam correspondence in initial
access and RRC\_INACTIVE are only applied under side conditions in
Clause 6.6.7.3.2.

#### 6.6.7.4 Applicability

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the
following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements either based
on SSB or based on CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the beam
correspondence requirements based on SSB and CSI-RS.

\- For a UE supporting either SSB based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet the supported enhanced beam
correspondence requirements.

\- For a UE supporting both SSB based and CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence UE shall meet the both SSB based and CSI-RS based
enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the following
applicability rules for verifying the requirements apply:

\- The enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be verified with
the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions in clause
6.6.7.3.2. If the UE meets the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements using the side conditions in clause 6.6.7.3.2 and meets the
minimum peak EIRP requirement as defined in clause 6.2.1.6 using the
CSI-RS based side conditions in clause 6.6.7.3.3, where the link
direction is determined in the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
test, the UE is considered to have met both the SSB based and CSI-RS
based enhanced beam correspondence requirements.

\- Otherwise, if UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement as
defined in clause 6.2.1.6 using the CSI-RS based side conditions in
clause 6.6.7.3.3, the enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be
further verified for the UE with the CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence side conditions in clause 6.6.7.3.3.

For the beam correspondence requirement for power class 6 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE, the following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets beam correspondence requirements in initial access, it
is considered to have met the beam correspondence requirements in
RRC\_INACTIVE.

### 6.6.8 Beam correspondence for power class 7

#### 6.6.8.1 General

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 7 UEs consists of
two components: UE minimum peak EIRP (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.7), and
UE spherical coverage (as defined in Clause 6.2.1.7).

Power class 7 UE shall mandatorily support IE
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*, as defined in TS 38.306
\[14\]. The UE shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to
Table 6.2.1.7-1 and spherical coverage requirement according to Table
6.2.1.7-3.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceSSB-based-r16* is supported, the UE shall meet
the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.7-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.7-3 using the
side conditions for SSB based enhanced beam correspondence requirements
as defined in Clause 6.6.8.3.2.

\- If *beamCorrespondenceCSI-RS-based-r16* is supported, the UE shall
meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement according to Table 6.2.1.7-1 and
spherical coverage requirement according to Table 6.2.1.7-3 using the
side conditions for CSI-RS based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements as defined in Clause 6.6.8.3.3.

The beam correspondence requirement for power class 7 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE consists of UE spherical coverage only:

\- UE shall meet the spherical coverage requirement for initial access
and RRC\_INACTIVE according to Table 6.2.1.7-3, with its autonomously
chosen UL beams and without uplink beam sweeping, using the side
conditions for initial access and in RRC\_INACTIVE as defined in Clause
6.6.8.3.4.

#### 6.6.8.2 Void 

#### 6.6.8.3 Side Conditions

##### 6.6.8.3.1 Side Condition for beam correspondence based on SSB and CSI-RS

The beam correspondence requirements are only applied under the
following side conditions:

\- The downlink reference signals including both SSB and CSI-RS are
provided and Type D QCL shall be maintained between SSB and CSI-RS.

\- The reference measurement channel for beam correspondence is
fulfilled according to the CSI-RS configuration in Annex A.3.

##### 6.6.8.3.4 Side Condition for Beam Correspondence requirements in initial access and RRC\_INACTIVE

The beam correspondence requirements for beam correspondence in initial
access and RRC\_INACTIVE are only applied under side conditions in
Clause 6.6.8.3.2.

#### 6.6.8.4 Applicability

For UEs supporting more than one type of beam correspondence, the
following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets enhanced beam correspondence requirements either based
on SSB or based on CSI-RS, it is considered to have met the beam
correspondence requirements based on SSB and CSI-RS.

\- For a UE supporting either SSB based or CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet the supported enhanced beam
correspondence requirements.

\- For a UE supporting both SSB based and CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence, the UE shall meet both SSB based and CSI-RS based
enhanced beam correspondence requirements and the following
applicability rules for verifying the requirements apply:

\- The enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be verified with
the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence side conditions in clause
6.6.8.3.2. If UE meets the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
requirements using the side conditions in clause 6.6.8.3.2 and meets the
minimum peak EIRP requirement as defined in clause 6.2.1.7 using the
CSI-RS based side conditions in clause 6.6.8.3.3, where the link
direction is determined in the SSB based enhanced beam correspondence
test, the UE is considered to have met both the SSB based and CSI-RS
based enhanced beam correspondence requirements.

\- Otherwise, if UE does not meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement as
defined in clasue 6.2.1.7 using the CSI-RS based side conditions in
clause 6.6.8.3.3, the enhanced beam correspondence requirements shall be
further verified for the UE with the CSI-RS based enhanced beam
correspondence side conditions in clause 6.6.8.3.3.

For the beam correspondence requirement for power class 7 UEs in initial
access and in RRC\_INACTIVE, the following applicability rules apply:

\- If a UE meets beam correspondence requirements in initial access, it
is considered to have met the beam correspondence requirements in
RRC\_INACTIVE.

6.6A Beam correspondence for CA
-------------------------------

For intra-band CA in FR2, the same beam correspondence relationship for
beam management is supported across CCs in this release of the
specification and no requirement is specified. Beam correspondence
performance for intra-band CA is fulfilled if the beam correspondence
requirements defined in clause 6.6 is met for non-CA case.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
and each UL band is configured with a single CC, with all CCs active
with non-zero UL RB allocation, the following beam correspondence
requirements apply for each CC:

1 The minimum peak EIRP requirement specified for UL inter-band CA in
6.2A, based on test conditions in clause 6.6. Reference signal power
adjustments by ∆MB~S,n~ are replaced by ΔR~IB,S,n~, where referenced.

2 The common spherical coverage requirement specified for UL inter-band
CA in 6.2A, based on test conditions in clause 6.6. Reference signal
power adjustments by ∆MB~S,n~ are replaced by ΔR~IB,S,n~, where
referenced.

7 Receiver characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified over
the air (OTA). The power levels for all DL signals and interferers are
defined assuming a 0 dBi reference antenna located at the center of the
quiet zone.

7.2 Diversity characteristics
-----------------------------

The minimum requirements on effective isotropic sensitivity (EIS) apply
to two measurements, corresponding to DL signals in orthogonal
polarizations.

7.3 Reference sensitivity
-------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is defined as the EIS
level at the centre of the quiet zone in the RX beam peak direction, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.3.2 Reference sensitivity power level

#### 7.3.2.1 Reference sensitivity power level for power class 1

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and
A.3.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal
as described in Annex A.5.2.1) with peak reference sensitivity specified
in Table 7.3.2.1-1. The requirement is verified with the test metric of
EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link Angle).

The requirement shall be met for an uplink transmission using QPSK
DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink transmission bandwidth less than or
equal to that specified in Table 7.3.2.1-2.

Unless given by Table 7.3.2.1-3, the minimum requirements for reference
sensitivity shall be verified with the network signalling value NS\_200
(Table 6.2.3-1) configured.

#### 7.3.4.3 EIS spherical coverage for power class 3

The reference measurement channels and throughput criterion shall be as
specified in clause 7.3.2.3

The maximum EIS at the 50^th^ percentile of the CCDF of EIS measured
over the full sphere around the UE is defined as the spherical coverage
requirement and is found in Table 7.3.4.3-1 below. The requirement is
verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=Spherical coverage grid,
Meas=Link angle).

For the UEs that support multiple FR2 bands, the minimum requirement for
EIS spherical coverage in Table 7.3.4.3-1 shall be increased per band,
respectively, by the EIS spherical coveragerelaxation parameter ∆MB~S,n~
as specified in clause 6.2.1.3. The requirement for the UE which
supports a single FR2 band is specified in Table 7.3.4.3-1. The
requirement for the UE which supports multiple FR2 bands is specified in
both Table 7.3.4.3-1 and Table 6.2.1.3-4.

#### 7.3A.2.3 Inter-band CA

The inter-band requirement applies for all active component carriers.
The throughput for each component carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1) with peak reference
sensitivity for each carrier specified in section 7.3.2, and relaxation
**ΔR~IB,P,n~** applied to peak reference sensitivity requirement.
**ΔR~IB,P,n~** is specified in Table 7.3A.2.3-1. The requirement on each
component carrier shall be met when the power in the component carrier
in the other band is set to its EIS spherical coverage requirement for
inter-band CA specified in sub-clause 7.3A.3.3.

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation,
the intra-band CA relaxation, ΔRIBC and ΔRIBNC, are also applied
according to the clause 7.3A.2.1 and 7.3A.2.2.

#### 7.3A.3.1 Void

#### 7.3A.3.2 Void

#### 7.3A.3.3 EIS spherical coverage for inter-band CA

The inter-band CA requirement applies per operating band, for all active
component carriers with UL assigned to one band and one DL component
carrier per band. The requirement on each component carrier shall be met
when the power in the component carrier in the other band is set to its
EIS spherical coverage requirement for inter-band CA specified in this
sub-clause.

The inter-band CA spherical coverage requirement for each power class
will be satisfied if the intersection set of spherical coverage areas
exceeds the common coverage requirement. Intersection set of spherical
coverage areas is defined as a fraction of area of full sphere measured
around the UE where both bands meet their defined individual EIS
spherical coverage requirements for inter-band CA operation. The common
coverage requirement is determined as \<100-percentile rank\> %, where
'percentile rank' is the percentile value in the specification of
spherical coverage for that power class from clause 7.3.4. The
requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=Beam peak
search grids, Meas=Link angle).

The reference measurement channels and throughput criterion shall be as
specified in clause 7.3A.2.3. The requirement shall be met for an uplink
transmission using QPSK DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in clause 7.3.2.

Unless otherwise specified, the minimum requirements for reference
sensitivity shall be verified with the network signalling value NS\_200
(Table 6.2.3.1-1) configured.

The required spherical coverage EIS for each band in inter-band CA
operation is given in clause 7.3.4 and modified by ΔR~IB,S,n~. The value
of ∆R~IB,S,n~ is defined in Table 7.3A.3.3-1.

7.3K Spherical coverage requirement for simultaneous reception from multiple directions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.3K.0 General

For this release, the requirement applies only to FR2-1 UEs that support
the following set of capabilities:

1\. simultaneousReceptionDiffTypeD-r16

2\. At least one of:

a\. singleDCI-SDM-scheme-r16 or

b\. multiDCI-MultiTRP-r16 and either of:

i\. overlapPDSCHsFullyFreqTime-r16.

ii\. overlapPDSCHsInTimePartiallyFreq-r16

The requirement applies for simultaneous reception of rank 2 PDSCH,
where each layer uses overlapping RBs in both time and frequency and is
associated with a unique TCI state and AoA. The scheduled TCI states for
the rank 2 PDSCH shall be configured with different QCL type-D reference
signals respectively. The DL power at the center of quiet zone from each
AoA equals the EIS spherical coverage requirement from sub-clause 7.3.4.

For UEs supporting *singleDCI-SDM-scheme-r16,* the cumulative throughput
in the DL associated with both TCI-states shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified A.3.3.2-5
and A.3.3.2-6 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1).

For UEs supporting *multiDCI-MultiTRP-r16*, the throughput in the DL
associated with each TCI-state shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified A.3.3.2-1 and
A.3.3.2-2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1).

The requirement shall be met for an uplink transmission using QPSK
DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink transmission bandwidth less than or
equal to the downlink transmission bandwidth. The UL is assigned to any
one of the two TCI-states scheduled for simultaneous DL, with reference
measurement channel as specified in Annex A.2.3.2. The transmitter shall
be set to PUMAX as defined in clause 6.2.4.

Unless otherwise specified, the minimum requirements shall be verified
with the network signalling value NS\_200 (Table 6.2.3.1-1) configured.

### 7.3K.1 (Reserved)

### 7.3K.2 (Reserved)

### 7.3K.3 2AoA spherical coverage of power class 3

The requirements apply to the UE when tested in a test system as
described in Annex L. The requirement is verified with the test metric
of throughput (Link= 2AoA spherical coverage grid, Meas=Link Angle).

The spherical coverage requirement for simultaneous reception from
multiple directions is defined in terms of the probability to support
simultaneous reception of rank 2 PDSCH defined in sub-clause 7.3K.0. The
probability (see Annex L) is defined as the spatial average over the
full sphere around the UE of the probability of any one direction to
support 2 AoA reception. In the applicable test system (see Annex L),
the probability of any one direction of the UE to support 2 AoA
reception for any specific AoA separation is the ratio of the number of
unique AoA pairs that include that direction and can support 2 AoA
reception to the total number of verified unique AoA pairs that include
that direction.

The requirement applies only for the UE's declared orientation in the
positioner of the test system. The requirement for each AoA separation
condition applies only for the UE's declared orientation in the
positioner of the test system for that AoA separation. The minimum
required overall probability to support 2 AoA reception for power class
3 UEs for any channel bandwidth is specified by AoA separation in table
7.3K.3-1. The UE is only required to fulfil the requirement at any one
of AoA separations declared from Table 7.3K.3-1.

### 7.3K.6 2AoA spherical coverage for power class 6

The requirements for a power class 6 UE are applicable with network
signalling *highSpeedDeploymentTypeFR2-r17* configured as
*bidirectional*. UE spherical coverage evaluation areas are found in
Table 6.2.1.6-3a in clause 6.2.1.6, by consisting of Area-1 and Area-2,
in the reference coordinate system in Annex L.1. If one AoA is within
Area-1 and another AoA is within Area-2, the 2AoA spherical coverage
requirements apply with DL power specified in Table 7.3K.6-1 for the
PDSCH of each AoA. For any AoA pair selected from Area-1 and Area-2,
respectively, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels. The requirement is verified with
a 150° angular separation between 2AoAs. The requirement is verified
with the test metric of Throughput (Link=2AoA Spherical coverage grid,
Meas=Link angle).

The requirement shall be met for an uplink transmission using QPSK
DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink transmission bandwidth less than or
equal to that specified in Table 7.3.2.1-2.

Unless given by Table 7.3.2.1-3, the minimum requirements for 2AoA
spherical coverage shall be verified with the network signalling value
NS\_200 (Table 6.2.3.1-1) configured.

7.4 Maximum input level
-----------------------

The maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power, for which
the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

The maximum input level is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode in the direction where peak
gain is achieved.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.4.-1. The requirement is
verified with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction,
Meas=Link angle).

### 7.4A.1 Maximum input level for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the input level is defined
as the cumulative received power, summed over the transmission bandwidth
configurations of each active DL CC. All DL CCs shall be active
throughout the test. The input power shall be distributed among the
active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with each other. At the maximum
input level, the specified relative throughput shall meet or exceed the
minimum requirements for the specified reference measurement channel
over each component carrier. The minimum requirement is specified in
Table 7.4A-1.

The maximum input level is defined as a directional requirement. The
requirement is verified in beam locked mode in the direction where peak
gain is achieved. The requirement is verified with the test metric of
EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

### 7.4A.2 Maximum input level for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation the requirement of
section 7.4A.1 applies

### 7.4A.3 Maximum input level for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the maximum input
level is defined with the uplink active on the band other than the band
whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements
specified in clause 7.4 for each component carrier while all downlink
carriers are active.

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation and
uplink carrier(s) assigned to one NR band, the requirement is defined
with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is
being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in clause
7.4A.1 and 7.4A.2 for each band while all downlink carriers are active.

7.5 Adjacent channel selectivity
--------------------------------

Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive a NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence
of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the
centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
the wanted signal and the interfering signal are both from the direction
where peak gain is achieved.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations,
under the assumption of polarization match.

The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5-1 for
all values of an adjacent channel interferer up to --25 dBm. However, it
is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper
range of test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5-2 and Table 7.5-3 where
the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and
A.3.3.2, with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal
as described in Annex A.5.2.1. The requirement is verified with the test
metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

**Table 7.5A-3: Void**

### 7.5A.1 Adjacent channel selectivity for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the SCC(s) shall be
configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The input power shall
be distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with
each other. The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in
Table 7.5A.1-1 for an adjacent channel interferer on either side of the
aggregated downlink signal at a specified frequency offset and for an
interferer power up to -25 dBm.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2
and A.3.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1). The requirement is verified
with the test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link
angle).

### 7.5A.2 Adjacent channel selectivity for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two component
carriers, two different requirements apply for out-of-gap and in-gap.
For out-of-gap, the UE shall meet the requirements for each component
carrier as specified in clauses 7.5. For in-gap, the requirement applies
if the following minimum gap condition is met:

∆*f~ACS~* ≥ BW~1~/2 + BW~2~/2 + max(BW~1~, BW~2~),

where ∆*f~ACS~* *is the f*requency separation between the center
frequencies of the component carriers and BW*~k~* are the channel
bandwidths of carrier *k*, *k* = 1,2.

If the minimum gap condition is met, the UE shall meet the requirements
specified in clauses 7.5 for each component carrier considered. The
respective channel bandwidth of the component carrier under test will be
used in the parameter calculations of the requirement. In case of more
than two component carriers, the minimum gap condition is computed for
any pair of adjacent component carriers following the same approach as
the two component carriers. The in-gap requirement for the corresponding
pairs shall apply if the minimum gap condition is met.

For every component carrier to which the requirements apply, the UE
shall meet the requirement with one active interferer signal (in-gap or
out-of-gap) while all downlink carriers are active and the input power
shall be distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned
with each other.

### 7.5A.3 Adjacent channel selectivity for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the adjacent
channel requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.5 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active. **The requirement does not apply
if the interferer of the band being tested overlaps any part of the
component carrier on the other band.**

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation and
uplink carrier(s) assigned to one NR band, the requirement is defined
with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is
being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in clauses
7.5A.1 and 7.5A.2 for each band while all downlink carriers are active.

7.6 Blocking characteristics
----------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the spurious response or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted
input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver
beyond a specified limit. The blocking performance shall apply at all
frequencies except those at which a spurious response occurs.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
the wanted signal and the interfering signal are both from the direction
where peak gain is achieved.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations,
under the assumption of polarization match.

### 7.6.2 In-band blocking

In-band blocking is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive a NR
signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
interferer at a given frequency offset from the centre frequency of the
assigned channel.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and
A.3.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal
as described in Annex A.5.2.1). The requirement is verified with the
test metric of EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

#### 7.6A.2.1 In-band blocking for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the SCC(s) shall be
configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The input power shall
be distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with
each other. The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in
Table 7.6A.2-1 for in the presence of an interferer at a given frequency
offset from the centre frequency of the assigned channel and an
interferer power shall not exceed -25 dBm. The throughput of each
carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.3.2 and A.3.3.2 (with
one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described
in Annex A.5.2.1). The requirement is verified with the test metric of
EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle).

#### 7.6A.2.2 In-band blocking for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with two component
carriers, the requirement applies to out-of-gap and in-gap. For
out-of-gap, the UE shall meet the requirements for each component
carrier with parameters as specified in 7.6.2-1. The requirement
associated to the maximum channel between across the component carriers
is selected. For in-gap, the requirement shall apply if the following
minimum gap condition is met:

∆*f~IBB~* ≥ 0.5(BW~1~ + BW~2~) + 2 max(BW~1~, BW~2~),

where ∆*f~IBB~ is the f*requency separation between the center
frequencies of the component carriers and BW*~k~* are the channel
bandwidths of carrier *k*, *k* = 1,2.

If the minimum gap condition is met, the UE shall meet the requirement
specified in Table 7.6.2-1 for each component carrier. The respective
channel bandwidth of the component carrier under test will be used in
the parameter calculations of the requirement. In case of more than two
component carriers, the minimum gap condition is computed for any pair
of adjacent component carriers following the same approach as the two
component carriers. The in-gap requirement for the corresponding pairs
shall apply if the minimum gap condition is met. For every component
carrier to which the requirements apply, the UE shall meet the
requirement with one active interferer signal (in-gap or out-of-gap)
while all downlink carriers are active and the input power shall be
distributed among the active DL CCs so their PSDs are aligned with each
other.

#### 7.6A.2.3 In-band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the in-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.2 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active. **The requirement does not apply
if the interferer of the band being tested overlaps any part of the
component carrier on the other band.**

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation and
uplink carrier(s) assigned to one NR band, the requirement is defined
with the uplink active on the band other than the band whose downlink is
being tested. The UE shall meet the requirements specified in clauses
7.6A.2.1 and 7.6A.2.2 for each band while all downlink carriers are
active.

7.9 Spurious emissions
----------------------

The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver. The spurious emissions power level is measured
as TRP.

The power of any narrow band CW spurious emission shall not exceed the
maximum level specified in Table 7.9-1. The requirement is verified in
beam locked mode with the test metric of TRP (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=TRP grid).

A.2.3 Reference measurement channels for TDD
--------------------------------------------

For UL RMCs defined below, TDD slot pattern defined in Table A.2.3-1
will be used for the requirements requiring at least one sub frame (1ms)
for the measurement period. For other requirements, TDD slot patterns
defined for reference sensitivity tests in Table A.3.3.1-1 will be used.

A.3 DL reference measurement channels
=====================================

A.3.1 General
-------------

Unless otherwise stated, Tables A.3.3.2-1 and A.3.3.2-2 are applicable
for measurements of the Receiver Characteristics (clause 7).

Unless otherwise stated, Tables A.3.3.2-1 and A.3.3.2-2 also apply for
the modulated interferer used in Clauses 7.5 and 7.6 with test specific
bandwidths.

CSI-RS configuration parameter defined in Table A.3.1-2 and Table
A.3.1-3 are used for verifying the beam correspondence requirement, 2
slots of CSI-RS shall be provided at each test grid point. The DL
channel shall be configured for zero power on all tones except those
used by CSI-RS in slots containing CSI-RS for beam refinement, and the
DL and UL channel sizes shall be the same during verification.

these limits the requirements of the present documents shall be
fulfilled.

E.2 Environmental
=================

The requirements in this clause apply to all types of UE(s).

E.2.1 Temperature
-----------------

All RF requirements for UEs operating in FR2 are defined over the air
and can only be tested in an OTA chamber.

The UE shall fulfil all the requirements in the temperature range for
extreme conditions, as defined in Table E.2.1-1, unless explicitly
stated otherwise in any requirement.

Table E.2.1-1: Temperature conditions

Outside this temperature range the UE, if powered on, shall not make
ineffective use of the radio frequency spectrum. In no case shall the UE
exceed the transmitted levels as defined in clause 6.2 for extreme
operation.

E.2.2 Voltage
-------------

Editor\'s note: This requirement is incomplete. The following aspects
are either missing or not yet determined:

Methodology to control the voltage in a case which a power cable is not
connected to DUT is FFS since it is not agreed whether we can connect
the power cable to DUT at the OTA measurement situation yet.

The UE shall fulfil all the requirements in the full voltage range, i.e.
the voltage range between the extreme voltages.

The manufacturer shall declare the lower and higher extreme voltages and
the approximate shutdown voltage. For the equipment that can be operated
from one or more of the power sources listed below, the lower extreme
voltage shall not be higher, and the higher extreme voltage shall not be
lower than that specified below.

Outside this voltage range the UE if powered on, shall not make
ineffective use of the radio frequency spectrum. In no case shall the UE
exceed the transmitted levels as defined in clause 6.2 for extreme

######## Annex F (normative): Transmit modulation

F.1 Measurement Point
=====================

Figure F.1-1 shows the measurement point for the unwanted emission
falling into non-allocated RB(s) and the EVM for the allocated RB(s).

![](./media/image22.emf){width="6.695138888888889in" height="1.8875in"}

Figure F.1-1: EVM measurement points

F.2 Basic Error Vector Magnitude measurement
--------------------------------------------

The EVM is the difference between the ideal waveform and the measured
waveform for the allocated RB(s)

,

where

is a set of modulation symbols with the considered modulation scheme
being active within the measurement period,

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM,

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

The basic EVM measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time
domain for PUCCH and PUSCH and over one preamble sequence for the PRACH.

F.3 Basic in-band emissions measurement
=======================================

The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the
non-allocated resources blocks. The in-band emission requirement is
evaluated for PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions. The in-band emission
requirement is not evaluated for PRACH transmissions.

The in-band emissions are measured as follows

,

where

is a set of OFDM symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the measurement period,

is the starting frequency offset between the allocated RB and the
measured non-allocated RB (e.g. or for the first adjacent RB),

(resp. ) is the lower (resp. upper) edge of the UL system BW,

and are the lower and upper edge of the allocated BW, and

is the frequency domain signal evaluated for in-band emissions as
defined in the clause (ii)

The relative in-band emissions are, given by

where

is the number of allocated RBs

The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one
slot in the time domain. When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is
shortened due to multiplexing with SRS, the in-band emissions
measurement interval is reduced by one OFDM symbol, accordingly.

In the evaluation of in-band emissions, the timing is set according to ,
where sample time offsets and are defined in clause F.4.

F.4 Modified signal under test
==============================

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments.

The DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals or PRACH signal under test is modified
and, in the case of DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals, decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

The CP-OFDM modulated signals or PUSCH demodulation reference signal or
CP-OFDM modulated signalsunder test is equalised and, in the case of
PUCCH data signal decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

To minimize the error, the signal under test should be modified with
respect to a set of parameters following the procedure explained below.

Notation:

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length (defined in the next clauses) or the last sample of the first
window half if is even.

The EVM analyser shall

\- detect the start of each slot and estimate and ,

\- determine so that the EVM window of length is centred

\- on the time interval determined by the measured cyclic prefix minus
16κ samples of the considered OFDM symbol for symbol l for subcarrier
spacing configuration µ in a subframe, with l = 0 or l = 7\*2\^µ for
normal CP, i.e. the first 16κ samples of the CP should not be taken into
account for this step. In the determination of the number of excluded
samples, a sampling rate of 1/T~c~ is assumed. If a different sampling
rate is used, the number of excluded samples is scaled linearly.

\- on the measured cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol symbol
for all other symbols for normal CP and for symbol 0 to 11 for extended
CP.

\- on the measured preamble cyclic prefix for the PRACH

To determine the other parameters a sample timing offset equal to is
corrected from the signal under test. The EVM analyser shall then

\- correct the RF frequency offset for each time slot, and

\- apply an FFT of appropriate size. The chosen FFT size shall ensure
that in the case of an ideal signal under test, there is no measured
inter-subcarrier interference.

The carrier leakage shall be removed from the evaluated signal before
calculating the EVM and the in-band emissions; however, the removed
relative carrier leakage power also has to satisfy the applicable
requirement.

At this stage the allocated RBs shall be separated from the
non-allocated RBs. In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH EVM, the signal on the
non-allocated RB(s), , is used to evaluate the in-band emissions.

Moreover, the following procedure applies only to the signal on the
allocated RB(s).

\- In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate
the TX chain equalizer coefficients and used by the ZF equalizer for all
subcarriers by time averaging at each signal subcarrier of the amplitude
and phase of the reference and data symbols. The time-averaging length
is 1 slot. This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
signal subcarrier used by the ZF equalizer. The knowledge of data
modulation symbols may be required in this step because the
determination of symbols by demodulation is not reliable before signal
equalization.

\- In the case of PRACH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate the TX chain
coefficients and used for phase and amplitude correction and are seleted
so as to minimize the resulting EVM. The TX chain coefficients are not
dependent on frequency, i.e. and . The TX chain coefficient are chosen
independently for each preamble transmission and for each .

At this stage estimates of , , and are available. is one of the
extremities of the window , i.e. can be or , where if is odd and if is
even. The EVM analyser shall then

\- calculate EVM~l~ with set to ,

\- calculate EVM~h~ with set to .

F.5 Window length
=================

F.5.1 Timing offset
-------------------

As a result of using a cyclic prefix, there is a range of, which, at
least in the case of perfect Tx signal quality, would give close to
minimum error vector magnitude. As a first order approximation, that
range should be equal to the length of the cyclic prefix. Any time
domain windowing or FIR pulse shaping applied by the transmitter reduces
the range within which the error vector is close to its minimum.

F.5.2 Window length
-------------------

The window length *W* affects the measured EVM and is expressed as a
function of the configured cyclic prefix length. In the case where
equalization is present, as with frequency domain EVM computation, the
effect of FIR is reduced. This is because the equalization can correct
most of the linear distortion introduced by the FIR. However, the time
domain windowing effect can\'t be removed.

F.5.3 Window length for normal CP
---------------------------------

Table F.5.3-1 and Table F.5.3-2 below specify the EVM window length

F.6 Averaged EVM
================

The general EVM is averaged over basic EVM measurements for n slots in
the time domain.

,

where n is

$$n = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
40,\ for\ 60\ kHz\ SCS \\
80,\ for\ 120\ kHz\ SCS \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $$

for PUCCH, PUSCH.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus, is calculated using in the expressions above and is calculated
using .

Thus, we get:

*The calculation of the EVM for the demodulation reference signal,* ,
follows the same procedure as calculating the general EVM, with the
exception that the modulation symbol set defined in clause F.2 is
restricted to symbols containing uplink demodulation reference signals.

The basic measurements are first averaged over n slots in the time
domain to obtain an intermediate average .

$${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{DMRS}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\text{EVM}_{\text{DMRS},i}^{2}}$$

In the determination of each ![](./media/image78.wmf){width="0.75625in"
height="0.26805555555555555in"}, the timing is set to if , and it is set
to otherwise, where and are the general average EVM values calculated in
the same n slots over which the intermediate average is calculated. Note
that in some cases, the general average EVM may be calculated only for
the purpose of timing selection for the *demodulation reference signal
EVM*.

Then the results are further averaged to get the *EVM for the
demodulation reference signal,* ,

The PRACH EVM, , is averaged over 2 preamble sequence measurements for
long preamble formats as defined in table 6.3.3.1-1 in \[9\] and
averaged over 10 preamble sequence measurements for short preamble
formats as defined in table 6.3.3.1-2 in \[9\]..

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus, is calculated using and is calculated using .

Thus, we get:

F.7 Spectrum Flatness
=====================

The data shall be taken from FFT coded data symbols and the demodulation
reference symbols of the allocated resource block.

F.8 Phase offset measurement for DMRS bundling
==============================================

F.8.1 Measurement point
-----------------------

The measurement point for phase offset measurement is defined in Figure
F.8.1-1.

Figure F.8.1-1: Measurement point for phase offset for DMRS bundling

F.8.2 Symbols used
------------------

Phase offset is determined based on DMRS REs (3 DMRS symbols per slot)
with the option to use data symbols.

F.8.3 Modified test signal
--------------------------

Same as described in Annex F.4.

F.8.4 Phase offset measurement
------------------------------

The phase offset measurement is based on the phase response of the Tx
chain as derived based on Annex F.4.

The subcarrier at the carrier leakage frequency of the transmitted
signal shall be excluded from the measured subcarriers.

The phase difference
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)\ $for each measured
subcarrier between a reference timeslot t~ref~ and the measurement
timeslot t~m~ is then calculated as defined below:

$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \ \widetilde{\varphi}\left( t_{m},f \right) - \widetilde{\varphi}(t_{\text{ref}},f)$

The phase offset between the reference and measurement timeslots are
then calculated as the maximum over the results for all measured
subcarriers as shown below:

$PhaseOffset = \max_{f}{(\left| \mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) \right|)}$

F.9 Reserved
============

F.10 EVM for dual transmit polarizations
========================================

F.10.1 General
--------------

A zero-forcing (ZF) MIMO receiver architecture is used so that
transmissions by the UE, which are received by the test equipment on two
polarizations, can be demodulated by the test equipment receiver.

![X:\\PROJECT\\CMW\\DEVELOP\\USER\\1CM5\\KRAKOWSK\\NR\\NR\_EVM\_2L\_UL\_MIMO.png](./media/image90.png){width="6.5375in"
height="3.248611111111111in"}

Figure F.10.1-1: EVM calculation block diagram for 2-Layer UL MIMO

The TE receives signals from 2 different ports on two antenna
polarizations in the test system.

For UL MIMO measurements a MIMO equalization step as described in
section F.10.2 is performed to separate the layers.

For single layer transmissions received on two polarizations the MIMO
equalization step as described in section F.10.2 is replaced by a
maximum ratio combining step as described in section F.10.3.

Each layer is then processed as described in section F.10.4 to receive
the measurement results for each individual layer.

F.10.2 MIMO Equalization (UL MIMO transmission)
-----------------------------------------------

The MIMO equalization is based only on reference signals (DMRS) without
using any data symbols. For the equalization process all available DMRS
symbols shall be used.

The effective 2x2 channel matrix is estimated using reference signals of
different subcarriers, e.g. in case of DMRS antenna ports 0 and 2. In
case that same subcarriers are used, e.g. DMRS antenna ports 0 and 1, a
channel decomposition is necessary taking advantage of the orthogonal
codes *w~f~* and *w~t~* and assuming identical channel coefficients for
adjacent subcarriers of same CDM group.

Effective channel including the precoding matrix *P* is:

$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix}
{\widetilde{h}}_{0,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{0,1} \\
{\widetilde{h}}_{1,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{1,1} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

with

$${\widetilde{h}}_{n,\nu} = \frac{y_{n}r_{\nu}^{*}}{{|r_{\nu}|}^{2}}$$

where *y* denotes the received symbol on port index *n* and *r* the
reference signal for layer index *ν*.

Since reference signals of a specific layer are transmitted only on
subcarriers of one CDM group channel, interpolation is needed in order
to obtain channel coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel
interpolation is done using the channel coefficients of active CDM group
in all other CDM groups.

The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients
are obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing
the moving average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving
average window size is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of
allocation the window size is reduced accordingly.

The ZF equalizer coefficients are calculated as the inverse of the
effective channel matrix, in general:

$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{- 1}$

F.10.3 Maximum Ratio combining (Tx diversity transmission)
----------------------------------------------------------

The maximum ratio combining is based only on reference signals (DMRS)
without using any data symbols. For the equalization process all
available DMRS symbols shall be used.

The effective 2x1 channel matrix is estimated using reference signals of
different subcarriers. In case of transmit diversity, the effective
channel includes the precoding matrix *P*:

$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix}
{\widetilde{h}}_{0} \\
{\widetilde{h}}_{1} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

with

$${\widetilde{h}}_{n} = \frac{y_{n}r^{*}}{{|r|}^{2}}$$

where *y* denotes the received symbol on port index *n* and *r* the
reference signal.

Since reference signals are transmitted only on subcarriers of one CDM
group, channel interpolation is needed in order to obtain channel
coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done using
the channel coefficients of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.

The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients
are obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing
the moving average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving
average window size is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of
allocation the window size is reduced accordingly.

The ZF equalizer coefficients for maximum ratio combining are calculated
as pseudo inverse of effective channel, in general:

$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{+} = {({\widetilde{H}}^{H}\widetilde{H})}^{- 1}{\widetilde{H}}^{H}$

F.10.4 Layer processing
-----------------------

After performing either the MIMO equalization or maximum ratio combining
as described in section F.10.2 or F.10.3 respectively, each layer is
processed using the existing procedure as defined in Annex E of TS
38.521-2 \[5\].

Since the channel estimation is calculated only on the DMRS symbols, an
averaging including all 14 symbols of one slot, i.e. data and reference
signals, is needed in order to minimize EVM. The averaging is achieved
by the least square (LS) equalization method described for single layer
in Annex E.3. of TS 38.521-2 \[5\].

*MS(f,t)* and *NS(f,t)* are processed with a LS estimator, to derive one
equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated subcarrier.
*EC(f)* is defined for each layer as:

$\text{EC}_{\nu}(f) = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{13}{\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)^{*}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{13}{MS_{\nu}(f,t)^{*}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}$

With \* denoting complex conjugation. *EC(f)* are used to equalize layer
data symbols.

EVM equalizer spectral flatness is derived from equalizer coefficients
for each layer as follows:

$c_{\nu} = \left| \text{EC}_{\nu}(f) \right|\ \sqrt{\left| g_{\nu,0} \right|^{2} + \left| g_{\nu,1} \right|^{2}}$

This annex gives further information needed for understanding and
implementing 6.4D.4. The following terms should be understood as
follows:

\- Relative phase error: refers to the phase difference between signals
at different antenna ports, which should be ideally 0. It should be
understood as for a slot i.e. (slot) relative phase. It is calculated
based on DMRS symbols of that slot or on SRS symbols.

\- Difference of relative phase error: refers to the difference between
the relative phase error determined per slot and the relative phase
error determined based on the SRS transmitted.

G.1 Measurement Point
=====================

Figure G.1-1 shows the measurement point for the difference of relative
phase and power errors. To separate signals from the two transmitters,
it is necessary for the test equipment to perform joint demodulation by
inverting the 2x2 composite channel ('HGW') resulting from DUT precoding
'W' and antenna virtualization 'G' and OTA channel between DUT and test
equipment 'H'. Post processing refers to the calculation of the
phase/power errors, the averaging of phase and power errors per RB per
slot per channel port and the calculation of difference between relative
phases.

error for UL coherent MIMO

G.2 Relative Phase Error Measurement
====================================

Here are listed the different aspects that may lead to different
interpretations.

G.2.1 Symbols and subcarriers used
----------------------------------

Phase error is determined based on DMRS REs (DMRS mapping type A with 3
DMRS symbols per slot, the REs corresponding to the odd subcarriers and
DMRS symbols are non-allocated for data or DMRS) and SRS REs (with 4 SRS
symbols in the SRS slot, same SRS resource mapping is used for
non-codebook-based and codebook-based precoding).

For the DMRS and SRS to occupy identical SCs and maximimize their
frequency density, DMRS configuration type 1 and SRS comb2 configuration
are used.

UL RMC described in Annex A.2 is used.

G.2.2 CFO (carrier frequency offset) correction
-----------------------------------------------

The TE performs a CFO correction on a slot-by-slot basis using a common
frequency correction at the two uplink layers.

G.2.3 Steps of the measurement method
-------------------------------------

Below are detailed the steps necessary to obtain the maximum difference
of relative phase error during the 20ms time window.

1 Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna port, the SRS
relative phase error based on the last SRS transmitted on Ant1 and Ant2,
that relative phase error serves as a reference for the calculation of
the difference of relative phase error for each slot inside the 20 ms
time window.

The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.

2 Calculation for the last SRS transmitted, for each RB of the SRS
relative phase errors based on the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier SRS
relative phase errors determined in previous step.

The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted: $\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

3 CFO correction on slot-by-slot basis using a common frequency
correction for both antenna ports.

4 Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna, the phase over
the slot being analyzed. The phase is extracted from the channel
estimate derived from the 3 DMRS symbols of the slot using the LSE
technique.

The output is one vector of dimension
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$ for each
antenna port.

5 Calculation for a slot for each subcarrier of the relative phase error
(difference between the vectors determined in the previous step).

The output is subcarrier relative phase errors of a slot:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.

6 Calculation for a slot, for each RB of the relative phase errors based
on the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier relative phase errors
determined in previous step.

The output is a "slot relative phase error" vector for a
slot:$\ \left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

7 Calculation for a slot of the difference of relative phase errors
based on the "SRS relative phase error" (reference) determined in step 2
and the "slot relative phase error" determined in previous step.

The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector for a
slot:$\ \left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

8 Calculation for a slot of the arithmetic mean value of the "difference
of relative phase error" vector determined in previous step, this value
corresponds to an RB.

The output is a "difference of relative phase error" value for a slot:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack.$

9 Perform for each slot of the 20ms time window, steps 3 to 8.

The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ slots \right\rbrack$.

10 Calculation of the maximum value of the "difference of relative phase
error".

The output is the "difference of relative phase error" that should be
verified as complying with the 40° maximum allowable difference of
relative phase error requirement:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack$.

######## Annex H (Normative): Modified MPR behavior

H.1 Indication of modified MPR behavior
=======================================

This annex contains the definitions of the bits in the field
*modifiedMPR-Behaviour* indicated per supported NR band in the IE
*RF-Parameters* \[13\] by a UE supporting an MPR or A-MPR modified in a
given version of this specification. A modified MPR or A-MPR behaviour
can apply to a supported NR band in stand-alone operation (including CA
and NN-DC operation) or in non-standalone operation with the said NR
band as part of an EN-DC or NE-DC band combination. Moreover, the bits
in the field can explicitly indicate NS value(s) supported by a UE.

NOTE 1: In the present release, the *modifiedMPR-Behaviour* is indicated
\[13\] by an 8-bit bitmap per supported NR band.

######## Annex I (informative): Void

######## Annex J (normative): UE coordinate system

J.1 Reference coordinate system
===============================

This annex defines the measurement coordinate system for the NR UE. The
reference coordinate system as defined in IEEE Std 149 \[15\] is
provided in Figure J.1-1 below while Figure J.1.-2 shows the DUT in the
default alignment, i.e., the DUT and the reference coordinate systems
are aligned with α = 0^o^ and β = 0^o^ and γ = 0^o^ where α, β, and γ
describe the relative angles between the two coordinate systems.

**Figure J.1-2: DUT default alignment to coordinate system**

The following aspects are necessary:

\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed
in order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the
test, e.g., in the drawings used in this annex, the three buttons are on
the bottom of the device (front) and the camera is on the top of the
device (back).

\- An understanding of the origin and alignment the coordinate system
inside the test system i.e. the directions in which the x, y, z -axes
points inside the test chamber is needed in order to define unambiguous
DUT orientation, DUT beam, signal, interference, and measurement angles

J.2 Test conditions and angle definitions
=========================================

Tables J.2-1 through J.2-3 below provides the test conditions and angle
definitions for three permitted device alignment for the default test
condition, DUT orientation 1, and two different options for each
permitted device alignment to re-position the device for DUT Orientation
2 as outlined by figures in Tables J.2-1 through J.2-3.

For each UE requirement and test case, each of the parameters in Table
J.2-1 through J.2-6 need to be recorded, such that DUT positioning, DUT
beam direction, and angles of the signal, link/interferer, and
measurement are specified in terms of the fixed coordinate system.

Due to the non-commutative nature of rotations, the order of rotations
is important and needs to be defined when multiple DUT orientations are
tested.

The rotations around the x, y, and z axes can be defined with the
following rotation matrices

![](./media/image107.wmf){width="2.196527777777778in" height="1.0in"}

![](./media/image108.wmf){width="2.236111111111111in" height="1.0in"}

and

![](./media/image109.wmf){width="2.1256944444444446in" height="1.0in"}.

with the respective angles of rotation, *α*, *β*, *γ,* and

![](./media/image110.wmf){width="0.8895833333333333in" height="1.0in"}

Additionally, any translation of the DUT can be defined with the
translation matrix

![](./media/image111.wmf){width="1.8743055555555554in" height="1.0in"}

with offsets t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively and with

![](./media/image112.wmf){width="0.8743055555555556in" height="1.0in"}

The combination of rotations and translation is captured by the
multiplication of rotation and translation matrices.

For instance, the matrix M

$$\ M = T\left( t_{x},t_{y},t_{z} \right) \cdot R_{z}\left( \gamma \right) \cdot R_{y}\left( \beta \right) \cdot R_{x}\left( \alpha \right)$$

describes an initial rotation of the DUT around the x axis with angle
* α*, a subsequent rotation around the y axis with angle *β*, and a
final rotation around the z axis with angle *γ*. After those rotations,
the DUT is translated by t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively.

J.3 DUT positioning guidelines
==============================

The centre of the reference coordinate system shall be aligned with the
geometric centre of the DUT in order to minimize the offset between
antenna arrays integrated at any position of the UE and the centre of
the quiet zone.

Near-field coupling effects between the antenna and the
pedestals/positioners/fixtures generally cause increased signal ripples.
Re-positioning the DUT by directing the beam peak away from those areas
can reduce the effect of signal ripple on EIRP/EIS measurements. Figure
J.3-1 and J.3-2 illustrate how to reposition the DUT in distributed axes
and combined axes system, when the beam peak is directed to the DUTs
upper hemisphere (DUT orientation 1) or the DUTs lower hemisphere (DUT
orientation 2). While these figures are examples of different
positioning systems and other implementations are not precluded, the
relative orientation of the coordinate system with respect to the
antennas/reflectors and the axes of rotation shall apply to any
measurement setup.

height="2.582638888888889in"}

Figure J.3-2: DUT re-positioning for an example of combined-axes system

For EIRP/EIS measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure the
pedestal is not obstructing the beam path and that the pedestal is not
in closer proximity to the measurement antenna/reflector than the DUT.
For TRP measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure that the beam
peak direction is not obstructed by the pedestal and the pedestal is in
the measurement path only when measuring the back-hemisphere. No
re-positioning during the TRP measurement is required.

L.1 Spherical coverage grid for simultaneous reception or transmission in multiple directions
=============================================================================================

The reference coordinate system grid is defined as follows: The grid is
the set of locations described by a source/probe from the UE's
perspective when the TE completes a 3D spherical scan with a constant
step size for each rotational axis of its positioner. The grid comprises
intersection points of circles of fixed polar angle (geographic analog:
'latitude') and meridians of fixed azimuthal angle (geographic analog:
'longitude') and completely covers the sphere around the UE. A valid set
of locations for the source/probes are those that describes the same
constant step size grid from the UE's perspective over a complete
spherical scan. This condition is satisfied when the active
probes/sources are always contained in a plane of constant azimuthal
angle 'φ' in this reference system. The reference coordinate system with
example UE orientations is shown in figures in tables J.2-x.

L.2 Probability to support 2AoA reception
=========================================

For UEs required to fulfil a requirement on the probability for 2AoA
reception, the metric for a given AoA separation is the spatial average:

$$P_{spatial\_ av} = \ \sum_{\theta_{1}}^{}{\sum_{\varphi_{1}}^{}\left\{ P_{\text{directional\ \ }}(\theta_{1},\varphi_{1}).AW(\theta_{1}) \right\}}$$

Where:

> (θ~1~,φ~1~) are coordinates of any grid point in the UE-centered
> reference system described above.
>
> AW(θ~1~) is the area weight associated with each grid point with polar
> angle 'θ~1~', and:

$$\sum_{\theta_{1}}^{}{\sum_{\varphi_{1}}^{}\left\{ AW(\theta_{1}) \right\}} = 1$$

> *P~directional~(θ~1~,φ~1~)* is the probability that the direction
> given by coordinates (θ~1~,φ~1~) can support 2 AoA reception under the
> agreed UERF test conditions. *P~directional~(θ~1~,φ~1~)* is given by:

$$P_{\text{directional}}(\theta_{1},\varphi_{1}) = \ \{\frac{\text{PF}\left( AoApair\# 1 \right) + PF\left( AoApair\# 2 \right) + \ldots PF\left( AoApair\# n \right)}{n}\}$$

Where:

> AoApair\#x represents an AoApair with the chosen AoA separation of
> test that has one source at coordinates (θ~1~,φ~1~).
>
> 'n' is the maximum number of unique AoApairs that the TE can generate
> with one source at coordinates (θ~1~,φ~1~)
>
> *PF(AoApair\#x)* is the pass/fail outcome (1/0 respectively) of the
> throughput verification test
