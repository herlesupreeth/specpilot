For SBFD Deployment Case 4, consider 0% and 100% grid shift between two
networks for Urban Macro and Dense Urban Macro layer scenarios as shown
in Figure A.1.1-5.

Figure A.1.1-5: 0% and 100% grid shifts between two networks

For SLS in RAN1, use the following BS antenna layout (**see Figure
A.1.1-6**) for indoor office scenario (referring to Table 1 in
RP-180524), wherein,

\- X-axis is pointing down to the floor

\- The antenna array is mounted in the Y-Z plane with boresight along
the X-axis (ceiling mounted with boresight towards the floor)

\- The X-axis/Y-axis/Z-axis refer to LCS

A.2.1 gNB self-interference modelling
-------------------------------------

For gNB self-interference modelling in SLS of SBFD in RAN1, consider
introducing ratio of self-interference (RSI) to represent the overall
self-interference suppression capability of gNB by means of spatial
isolation, subband frequency isolation, digital interference
cancellation and beamform nulling/isolation, etc. RSI also takes into
account the impact of Tx/Rx antenna element gain on self-interference.

For SLS of SBFD in RAN1, the RSI is modelled as frequency flat within
the UL subband. The residual self-interference *power* on the UL subband
when all the DL RBs in the DL subbands are allocated with maximum gNB DL
Tx Power *is computed by*

$$\begin{matrix}
I_{\text{SI}}^{\max} = \frac{P_{\text{tx}}^{\max}}{\alpha_{\text{SI}}}*\frac{N_{\text{ULRB}}}{N_{\text{DLRB}}}\#\left( A - 1 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

\- $I_{\text{SI}}^{\max}$ is the residual self-interference *power* on
the UL subband when all the DL RBs in the DL subbands are allocated with

linear scale.* RAN1 assumes frequency isolation value in the overall RSI
value ranges provided by RAN4 is based on the assumption of SBFD subband
configuration with {DUD=40MHz:20MHz:40MHz} at least for FR1 and all the
DL RBs in the DL subbands are allocated with maximum gNB DL Tx Power.
Candidate values for $\alpha_{\text{SI}}$ at least can be determined
based on the assumption that UL receiver sensitivity degradation due to
self-interference is 1dB. *Companies shall report what values of the
individual components are assumed in order to achieve the*
$\alpha_{\text{SI}}$ *value corresponding to 1 dB desense. Other
approaches of determining values for* $\alpha_{\text{SI}}$ *are not
precluded and can be used and reported by companies.*

Assuming $\alpha_{\text{SI}}$ doesn't change when DL RBs are not fully
allocated for DL transmission, the residual self-interference power on
one UL RB when DL RBs are not fully allocated for DL transmission is
computed by

$$\begin{matrix}
I_{\text{SI}}^{per - RB} = \frac{P_{\text{tx}}^{per - RB}}{\alpha_{\text{SI}}}*\frac{N_{used - DL - RB}}{N_{\text{DLRB}}}\#\left( A - 2 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

\- $I_{\text{SI}}^{per - RB}$ is the residual self-interference *power*
on one UL PRB when all the DL RBs in the DL subbands are not fully
allocated for DL transmission (in linear scale).

\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}

\end{matrix}$$

where

\- $P_{\text{tx}}^{sector - x,\ per - RB}$ is DL Tx power of sector *x*
per RB (in linear scale),

\- Note: $\text{ACLR}_{\text{BS}}$ and $\text{ACS}_{\text{BS}}$ are in
linear scale. gNB ACLR (i.e.,$\text{ACLR}_{\text{BS}}$) is provided as
the candidate for Tx leakage, and gNB ACS

$10*\log_{10}\left( \alpha_{adj,co - site - x} \right) = \text{spatial\ isolation}_{\text{dB}} + 10*\log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\text{ACLR}_{\text{BS}}} + \frac{1}{\text{ACS}_{\text{BS}}}} \right) + \ldots\ $

\- FFS the concrete value of $\alpha_{adj,co - site - x}$

\- $\text{ACLR}_{\text{BS}}$ and $\text{ACS}_{\text{BS}}$ are in linear

A.2.6 Inter-site gNB-gNB adjacent-channel CLI
---------------------------------------------

Regarding gNB-gNB adjacent-channel CLI modelling for system level
simulation, RAN1 understands at least the following aspects need to be
considered:

\- **Aspect 1:** The unwanted emissions **due** to Tx non-linearity at
the transmitter of the aggressor from the allocated RBs in one carrier
to the non-allocated RBs in the adjacent carrier.

\- **Aspect 2:** The receiver selectivity at the victim to receive the
desired signal in the allocated RBs in one carrier in the presence of
the unwanted signals at the non-allocated RBs in the adjacent carrier.
(e.g., receiver blocking at the victim, overload of the receiver dynamic
range, etc).

**For inter-site gNB-gNB adjacent-channel CLI modelling, reuse similar
method as inter-site gNB-gNB co-channel inter-subband CLI modelling with
gNB ACLR for TX leakage and gNB ACS for Receiver impairment.**

**For SLS in RAN1, if only large scale fading is modelled and small
scale fading is not modelled for inter-site gNB-gNB adjacent-channel
channel model, the power of inter-site gNB-gNB adjacent-channel CLI
experienced by the victim gNB on each receiver chain at one UL RB can be
modelled as**

$\begin{matrix}
I_{gNB - gNB - adjacent - channel - CLI}^{A^{'} \rightarrow A,per - RB} = P_{\text{tx}}^{\text{BS\ }A^{'}}*\text{CL}^{\text{BS\ }A^{'} \rightarrow \text{BS\ }A}*\left( \frac{1}{\text{ACLR}_{\text{BS}}} + \frac{1}{\text{ACS}_{\text{BS}}} \right)*\frac{1}{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{total}}}\#\left( A - 12 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$

***where***

\-
$I_{gNB - gNB - adjacent - channel - CLI}^{A^{'} \rightarrow A,per - RB}$
is the power of inter-site gNB-gNB adjacent-channel CLI from gNB $A^{'}$
to gNB $A$ on each receiver chain at one UL RB (linear value).

\- $P_{\text{tx}}^{\text{BS\ }A^{'}}$ is DL transmission power of gNB
$A^{'}$ across all transmit chains over the scheduled DL RBs (linear
value).

\- $\text{CL}^{\text{BS\ }A^{'} \rightarrow \text{BS\ }A}\ $is the
coupling loss between gNB $A^{'}$ and gNB $A$ (linear value), accounting
for beamforming at the aggressor gNB and victim gNB.

\- $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{total}}$ is the total number of RBs of the
channel bandwidth (e.g., 100MHz for FR1) of the aggressor gNB.

\- Note: $\text{ACLR}_{\text{BS}}$ *(i.e.,* gNB ACLR*) and*
$\text{ACS}_{\text{BS}}$ *(i.e.,* gNB ACS*) are in linear scale.* With
this assumption, in absence of further RAN4 inputs, gNB ACLR and gNB ACS
in current specification are used for both inter-site gNB-gNB co-channel
inter-subband CLI modelling and inter-site gNB-gNB adjacent-channel CLI
modelling. The values of $\text{ACLR}_{\text{BS}}$ *and*
$\text{ACS}_{\text{BS}}$ *used in* inter-site gNB-gNB co-channel and
adjacent-channel CLI modelling can be revisited based on further RAN4
inputs.

\- Note: This model is not applicable to the RBs in the guard band
between the two adjacent channels.

A.2.7 UE-UE adjacent-channel CLI
--------------------------------

Regarding UE-UE adjacent-channel CLI modelling for system level
simulation, RAN1 understands at least the following aspects need to be
considered:

**- Aspect 1**: The unwanted emissions **due** to Tx non-linearity at
the transmitter of the aggressor from the allocated RBs in one carrier
to the non-allocated RBs in the adjacent carrier.

**-** **Aspect 2**: The receiver selectivity at the victim to receive
the desired signal in the allocated RBs in one carrier in the presence
of the unwanted signals at the non-allocated RBs in the adjacent
carrier. (e.g. receiver blocking at the victim, overload of the receiver
dynamic range, etc)

**For UE-UE** adjacent**-channel CLI modelling,** reuse similar method
as inter-site gNB-gNB co-channel inter-subband CLI modelling with UE
**ACIR used in Rel-16 CLI study.**

For SLS in RAN1, if only large scale fading is modelled and small scale
fading is not modelled for UE-UE adjacent-channel channel model, the
power of UE-UE adjacent-channel CLI experienced by the victim UE on each
receiver chain at one DL RB can be modelled as

$\begin{matrix}
I_{UE - UE - adjacent - channel - CLI}^{B^{'} \rightarrow B,per - RB} = P_{\text{tx}}^{\text{UE\ }B^{'}}*\text{CL}^{\text{UE\ }B^{'} \rightarrow UE\ B}*\frac{1}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UE}}}*\frac{1}{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{total}}}\#\left( A - 13 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$

***where***

\-
$I_{UE - UE - adjacent - channel - CLI}^{B^{'} \rightarrow B,per - RB}$
is the power of UE-UE adjacent-channel CLI from UE $B^{'}$ to UE $B$ on
each receiver chain at one DL RB (linear value).

\- $P_{\text{tx}}^{\text{UE\ }B^{'}}$ is UL transmission power of UE
$B^{'}$ across all transmit chains over all UL RBs (linear value).

\- $\text{CL}^{\text{UE\ }B^{'} \rightarrow UE\ B}\ $is the coupling
loss between UE $B^{'}$ and UE $B$ (linear value), accounting for analog
beamforming at the aggressor UE and victim UE.

\- $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{total}}$ is the total number of RBs of the
channel bandwidth (e.g., 100MHz for FR1) of the aggressor UE.

\- Note: $\text{ACIR}_{\text{UE}}$ *are in linear scale.* In RAN4 reply
LS, RAN4 agree on UE ACLR based model on Tx and UE ACS based model on Rx
which is the same ACIR model as Rel-16 CLI study as starting point.

\- Note: This ACIR-based model is not applicable to the guard band
between the two adjacent channels.

A.2.8 BS noise figure model
---------------------------

For SLS of duplex evaluation in RAN1, the BS noise figure can be
modelled **as piece wise linear based on the total received power (P)
as**

$$\begin{matrix}
\text{NF\ }\left( \text{dB} \right) = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
C\ ,\ \ P < A \\
\frac{\ (D - \ C)}{(B - A)}\left( P - A \right) + C,\ \ A \leq P < B \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \#\left( A - 14 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

\- ***P* is in dB scale. The linear value of total received power is the
linear sum of all received power, including** wanted signal, co-channel
and adjacent-channel UE-gNB interference, self-interference, co-channel
and adjacent-channel *co-site* inter-sector interference *and*
co-channel and adjacent-channel *inter-site gNB-gNB* interference.

\- adjacent-channel interference is only used for SBFD deployment case 4

\- If *P* is larger than *B*, the receiver will be blocked.

\- If the piece wise BS NF model is used, the following can be used
regarding the values of A/B/C/D,

> \- FR1 WA BS (i.e., Urban Macro, Dense Urban Macro Layer) without
> sub-band filter: A = -43dBm, B = -25dBm, C = 5dB, D = 14dB
>
> \- (Low priority) FR1 WA BS (i.e., Urban Macro, Dense Urban Macro
> Layer) with sub-band filter: A = -35dBm, B = -17dBm, C = 5dB, D = 14dB
>
> \- FR1 MR BS (i.e., Dense Urban Micro Layer): A = -38dBm, B = -20dBm,
> C = 10dB, D = 19dB
>
> \- FR1 LA BS (i.e., Indoor): A = -35dBm, B = -17dBm, C = 13dB, D =
> 22dB
>
> \- FR2-1 BS: A = -58dBm, B = -40dBm, C = 10dB, D = 19dB

\- If fixed BS NF values are used, the following values are recommended,

> \- Urban Macro, Dense Urban Macro layer: 5dB for FR1, 10dB for FR2-1
>
> \- Dense Urban Micro layer: 5dB for FR1, 10dB for FR2-1
>
> \- Indoor: 5dB for FR1, 10dB for FR2-1

A.4 Performance metrics
=======================

A.4.1 UPT related performance metrics
-------------------------------------

UPT is defined as the size of an FTP packet divided by the time which
starts when the packet is received in the transmit buffer and ends when
the last bit of the packet is correctly delivered to the receiver
\[Refer to TR36.814\]. Unfinished FTP packets should be incorporated in
the UPT calculation. The number of served bits (possibly zero) of an
unfinished FTP packet by the end of the simulation is divided by the
served time (simulation end time -- file arrival time) \[Refer to
TR36.889\]. Consider zero bit for dropped FTP packets.

***[Mean/5%/50%/95% Average-UPT, Average-UPT CDF]{.underline}:***

\- Average-UPT of a user: defined as the average from all UPTs for all
FTP packets intended for this user \[Refer to TR36.814\].

\- Average-UPT CDF: the CDF of the Average-UPTs for all users.

\- Mean/5%/50%/95% Average-UPT: the mean/5%/50%/95% value of
Average-UPTs for all users.

***[Mean/5%/50%/95% Tail-UPT, Tail-UPT CDF]{.underline}:***

\- ***Tail-UPT of a user: defined as the worst 5% UPT among all FTP
packets intended for this user \[Refer to TR36.814\].***

\- ***Tail-UPT CDF: the CDF of the Tail-UPTs for all users.***

\- ***Mean/5%/50%/95% Tail-UPT: the mean/5%/50%/95% value of Tail-UPTs
for all users.***

***[Mean/5%/50%/95% Median-UPT, Median-UPT CDF]{.underline}:***

\- ***Median-UPT of a user: defined as the 50% UPT among all FTP packets
intended for this user.***

\- ***Median-UPT CDF: the CDF of the Median-UPTs for all users.***

\- ***Mean/5%/50%/95% Median-UPT: the mean/5%/50%/95% value of
Median-UPTs for all users.***

A.4.2 Latency related performance metrics
-----------------------------------------

***Packet latency is defined as the time which starts when the packet is
received in the transmit buffer and ends when the last bit of the packet
is correctly delivered to the receiver. HARQ re-transmission should be
considered for latency evaluation. Unfinished/dropped FTP packets are
not incorporated in the packet latency calculation.***

***[Mean/5%/50%/95% Packet-Latency, Packet-Latency CDF:]{.underline}***

\- Calculate the latency for each packet for each UE, and then generate
CDF of latency for all these packets from all the UEs.

\- Packet-Latency CDF is the CDF of the packet latencies of all the
packets from all the UEs.

\- Mean/5%/50%/95% Packet-Latency is the mean/5%/50%/95% value of
Packet-Latency of all the packets from all the UEs.

***[Mean/5%/50%/95% UE-Average-Latency, UE-Average-Latency
CDF:]{.underline}***

\- Calculate the latency for each packet for each UE, and then calculate
the average latency for each UE, then generate the CDF for these average
latency for each UE

users.

\- Mean/5%/50%/95% UE-Average-Latency is the mean/5%/50%/95% value of
UE-Average-Latency for all users.

A.4.3 RU and Unfinished/dropped FTP packets rate
------------------------------------------------

***[Type-1 RU:]{.underline}***

\- ***DL/UL Type-1 RU = Number of RBs per cell used by traffic for the
given link direction during observation time / Total number of all the
RBs per cell including DL, UL and guard bands over observation time.***

***[Type-2 RU:]{.underline}***

\- ***DL/UL Type-2 RU = Number of RBs per cell used by traffic for the
given link direction during observation time / Total number of RBs per
cell available for traffic for the given link direction over observation
time.***

***For both type-1 RU and type-2 RU, in case of MU-MIMO, one RB
allocated to N users within a cell is only counted as used once.***

***[Unfinished/dropped Packet Rate:]{.underline}***

\- *Unfinished/dropped Packet Rate is defined as the number of the
unfinished packets for all users divided by the total number of
generated packets for all users*

A.5 gNB antenna configuration and transmit power for SBFD
=========================================================

For evaluation of legacy TDD operation, BS uses the same antenna array
for downlink transmission and uplink reception, we can call it
shared-Tx/Rx antenna array for description of evaluation assumption. For
evaluation of SBFD operation, BS uses separate panels for simultaneous
downlink transmission and uplink reception, we can call it
separate-Tx/Rx antenna array for description of evaluation assumption.

The separate-Tx/Rx antenna array for description of evaluation
assumption ***can be modelled by two panel groups as in Figure A.5-1.***

\- Legacy parameters $\left( M,N,P,M_{g},N_{g} \right)$,
$\left( d_{H},d_{V} \right)$ and $\left( d_{g,H},d_{g,V} \right)$ are
used for description of each panel group:

\- ***M: Number of vertical antenna elements within a panel, on one
polarization***

\- ***N: Number of horizontal antenna elements within a panel, on one
polarization***

\- ***P: Number of polarizations***

\- $M_{g}$***: Number of panels in a column within a panel group.***

\- $N_{g}$***: Number of panels in a row within a panel group.***

\- $d_{g,H}$***: Antenna panel spacing in horizontal direction within a
panel group.***

\- $d_{g,V}$***: Antenna panel spacing in vertical direction within a
panel group.***

\- Companies are to report the separation of the two panel groups.
Introduce new parameters $\left( d_{a,H},d_{a,V} \right)$ ***as
illustrated in the following Figure A.5-1.***

\- $d_{a,H}$: Panel group spacing in the horizontal direction.
Typically, $d_{a,H}$ = 0.

\- $d_{a,V}$: Panel group spacing in the vertical direction.

Figure A.5-1: Separate-Tx/Rx antenna array model

For evaluation and comparison between SBFD and legacy TDD, three options
can be used.

\- **SBFD antenna configuration option-1**: The total number of antenna
elements of the antenna array for SBFD is the same as the total number
of antenna elements of the antenna array for legacy TDD. The total
number of TxRUs of the antenna array for SBFD is the same as the total
number of TxRUs of the antenna array for legacy TDD.

\- **SBFD antenna configuration option-2**: The total number of antenna
elements of the antenna array for SBFD is two times of the total number
of antenna elements of the antenna array for legacy TDD. The total
number of TxRUs of the antenna array for SBFD is the same as the total
number of TxRUs of the antenna array for legacy TDD.

\- **SBFD antenna configuration option-3**: The total number of antenna
elements of the antenna array for SBFD is the same as the total number
of antenna elements of the antenna array for legacy TDD. The total
number of TxRUs of the antenna array for SBFD is half of the total
number of TxRUs of the antenna array for legacy TDD.

These options are further clarified with examples in the following:

As shown in Figure A.5-2 (a), for legacy TDD with shared-Tx/Rx antenna
array, assume the antenna configuration is
$\left( M,N,P,M_{g},N_{g};M_{p},N_{p} \right)$. The total number of
TxRUs is $K = \text{PM}_{p}N_{p}M_{g}N_{g}$, and the total number of
antenna elements is $L = PMNM_{g}N_{g}$.

For SBFD antenna configuration option-1, the separate-Tx/Rx antenna
array has two panel groups, and the antenna configuration for each panel
group is $\left( M,N,P,M_{g}/2,N_{g} \right)$. The total number of TXRUs
is $K = \text{PM}_{p}N_{p}M_{g}N_{g}$ (same as legacy TDD), and the
total number of antenna elements is $L = PMNM_{g}N_{g}$(same as legacy
TDD). One method on the usage of TXRUs and antenna elements in
DL/UL/SBFD slots/symbols is illustrated as below. Other methods are not
precluded and can be reported by companies.

\- Method 1 (see Figure A.5-2 (b)):

\- In DL slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to
K⁄2 Tx chains in TxRU group\#1, and L⁄2 antenna elements on panel
group\#2 are connected to K⁄2 Tx chains in TxRU group\#2.

\- In UL slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to
K⁄2 Rx chains in TxRU group\#1, and L⁄2 antenna elements on panel
group\#2 are connected to K⁄2 Rx chains in TxRU group\#2.

\- In SBFD slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected
to K⁄2 Tx chains in TxRU group\#1, and L⁄2 antenna elements on panel
group\#2 are connected to K⁄2 Rx chains in TxRU group\#2.

**For SBFD antenna configuration option-2, the separate-Tx/Rx antenna
array has two panel groups, and the antenna configuration for each panel
group is** $\left( M,N,P,M_{g},N_{g} \right)$**. T**he total number of
TXRUs is $K = \text{PM}_{p}N_{p}M_{g}N_{g}$ (same as legacy TDD), and
the total number of antenna elements is $2L = 2PMNM_{g}N_{g}$(two times
of that for legacy TDD). Two methods on the usage of TXRUs and antenna
elements in DL/UL/SBFD slots/symbols are illustrated as below. Other
methods are not precluded and can be reported by companies.

\- Method 2-1 (see Figure A.5-2 (c)):

\- In DL slots, L antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to K
Tx chains.

\- In UL slots, L antenna elements on panel group\#2 are connected to K
Rx chains.

\- In SBFD slots, L antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to
K Tx chains, and L antenna elements on panel group\#2 are connected to K
Rx chains.

\- Method 2-2 (see Figure A.5-2 (d)):

\- In DL slots, L antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to K
Tx chains.

\- In UL slots, L antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to K
Rx chains.

\- In SBFD slots, L antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to
K Tx chains, and L antenna elements on panel group\#2 are connected to K
Rx chains.

**For SBFD antenna configuration option-3**, the separate-Tx/Rx antenna
array has two panel groups, and the antenna configuration for each panel
group is $\left( M,N,P,M_{g}/2,N_{g} \right)$. The total number of TXRUs
is $K/2 = \text{PM}_{p}N_{p}M_{g}N_{g}/2$ (half of that for legacy TDD),
and the total number of antenna elements is $L = PMNM_{g}N_{g}$(same as
legacy TDD). The method on the usage of TXRUs and antenna elements in
DL/UL/SBFD slots/symbols are illustrated as below. Other methods are not
precluded and can be reported by companies.

\- Method 3-1 (see Figure A.5-2 (e)):

\- In DL slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to
K⁄2 Tx chains.

\- In UL slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#2 are connected to
K⁄2 Rx chains.

\- In SBFD slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected
to K⁄2 Tx chains, and L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#2 are
connected to K⁄2 Rx chains.

\- Method 3-2 (see Figure A.5-2 (f)):

\- In DL slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to
K⁄2 Tx chains in TxRU group\#1.

\- In UL slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected to
K⁄2 Rx chains in TxRU group\#1.

\- In SBFD slots, L⁄2 antenna elements on panel group\#1 are connected
to K⁄2 Tx chains in TxRU group\#1, and L⁄2 antenna elements on panel
group\#2 are connected to K⁄2 Rx chains in TxRU group\#1.

Figure A.5-2: Illustration of antenna configuration of legacy TDD and
SBFD

For SBFD evaluation, assume the maximum BS transmit power is
proportional to the number of Tx chains used for transmission

\- For SBFD antenna configuration Option-1,

\- in DL-only symbols, the maximum BS transmit power for SBFD is the
same as that for legacy TDD

\- in SBFD symbols, the maximum BS transmit power for SBFD is half of
that for legacy TDD

\- For SBFD antenna configuration Option-2, in both DL-only symbols and
SBFD symbols, the maximum BS transmit power for SBFD is always the same
as that for legacy TDD

\- For SBFD antenna configuration Option-3, in both DL-only symbols and
SBFD symbols, the maximum BS transmit power for SBFD is always half of
that for legacy TDD

For BS transmit power for SBFD, take Option-1 as baseline. Option-2 can
also be evaluated.

\- Option-1: Power boosting is not assumed for SBFD symbols compared to
DL-only symbols (as in legacy systems), i.e., BS transmit power spectrum
density per Tx chain is kept the same for SBFD symbols and DL-only
symbols

\- Option-2: Power boosting is assumed for SBFD symbols compared to
DL-only symbols, i.e.,

\- DL symbols in SBFD operation have the same PSD as used in TDD DL
symbols

\- For SBFD symbols, its PSD is scaled according to the number of RBs in
DL subband(s), e.g.,

$$\text{PSD}_{\text{SBFD}}^{Per\ Tx - chain} = \text{PSD}_{DL - only}^{Per\ Tx - chain} \bullet \frac{\text{BW}_{\text{carrier}}}{\text{BW}_{\text{DL\ subbands}}}$$

\- $\text{PSD}_{\text{SBFD}}^{Per\ Tx - chain}$ is the BS transmit power
spectrum density per Tx chain in SBFD symbols

\- $\text{PSD}_{DL - only}^{Per\ Tx - chain}$ is the BS transmit power
spectrum density per Tx chain in DL-only symbols

\- $\text{BW}_{\text{carrier}}$ is the system bandwidth and
$\text{BW}_{\text{DL\ subbands}}$ is the total bandwidth of DL subbands

A.7 SBFD subband and slot configurations
========================================

For performance evaluation and comparison between baseline legacy TDD
operation and SBFD operation, one or more of the following alternatives
can be considered:

\- Alt 1 (No SBFD DL subband in the slots/symbols that correspond to UL
slots/symbols in legacy TDD):

\- Legacy TDD: Static TDD UL/DL configuration with {DDDSU}, where
S=\[12D:2G:0U\]

\- SBFD: Frame structure\#1 (DXXXU), where X denotes a SBFD slot. In
time domain, SBFD UL subband spans all the symbols in a SBFD slot. In
frequency domain, SBFD UL subband is about 20% of the channel bandwidth.

\- Alt 2 (No SBFD DL subband in the slots/symbols that correspond to UL
slots/symbols in legacy TDD):

\- Legacy TDD: Static TDD UL/DL configuration with {DDDSU}, where
S=\[12D:2G:0U\]

\- SBFD: Frame structure\#2 (XXXXU), where X denotes a SBFD slot. In
time domain, SBFD UL subband spans all the symbols in a SBFD slot. In
frequency domain, SBFD UL subband is about 20% of the channel bandwidth.

\- Alt 3 (strive for the same UL/DL resource ratio between Legacy TDD
and SBFD):

\- Legacy TDD: Static TDD UL/DL configuration with {DDSUU}, where
S=\[12D:2G:0U\]

\- SBFD: Frame structure\#2 (XXXXU), where X denotes a SBFD slot. In
time domain, SBFD UL subband spans all the symbols in a SBFD slot. In
frequency domain, SBFD UL subband is about 25% of the channel bandwidth.

\- Note: Alt 3 is deprioritized.

\- Alt 4 (strive for the same UL/DL resource ratio between Legacy TDD
and SBFD):

\- Legacy TDD: Static TDD UL/DL configuration with {DDDSU}, where
S=\[12D:2G:0U\]

\- SBFD: Frame structure\#3 (XXXXX), where X denotes a SBFD slot. In
time domain, SBFD UL subband spans all the symbols in a SBFD slot. In
frequency domain, SBFD UL subband is about 20% of the channel bandwidth.

Regarding the SBFD subband configuration for Alt 1/2/4, SBFD Subband
configuration\#1 with {DUD} pattern as following is assumed.

\- For FR1

\- Baseline: 100MHz channel bandwidth and 30kHz SCS (273 PRB): \< N~D~,
N~U~, N~G~ \> = \<104, 55, 5\>

\- Optional: 100MHz channel bandwidth and 30kHz SCS (273 PRB): \< N~D~,
N~U~, N~G~ \> = \<106, 51, 5\>

\- For FR2-1

\- Optional: 100MHz channel bandwidth and 120kHz SCS (66 PRB) \< N~D~,
N~U~, N~G~ \> = \<25, 14, 1\>

\- Baseline: 200MHz channel bandwidth and 120kHz SCS (132 PRB): \< N~D~,
N~U~, N~G~ \> = \<52, 26, 1\>

wherein,

\- N~D~ is the number of RBs in one DL subband.

\- N~U~ is the number of RBs in one UL subband.

\- N~G~ is the number of RBs in one guard band between one UL subband
and one DL subband.

\- Other values of \< N~D~, N~U~, N~G~ \> are not precluded and can be
reported by companies.

Regarding the SBFD slot configurations, companies should report the
guard symbols assumed in the SBFD operation.

The UL/DL resource ratio difference between legacy TDD and semi-static
SBFD is summarized as the following:

semi-static SBFD

  **Alt-3 (XXXXU vs. DDSUU)**                  FR1                                    38.93% -- 39.63%                       40%                    55.38% -- 57.44%   57.14%
                                               FR2-1                                  38.70% -- 39.39%                                              57.27% -- 59.39%   
  **Alt-4 (XXXXX vs. DDDSU)**                  FR1                                    20.15%                                 20%                    76.19%             77.14%
                                               FR2-1                                  19.70%                                                        78.79%             

Note1: For Alt1/2/4, baseline configuration of \< N~D~, N~U~, N~G~ \> is
used for evaluation purpose

Note2: For Alt-3, \< N~D~, N~U~, N~G~ \> = \<98, 67, 5\> is assumed for
FR1 and \< N~D~, N~U~, N~G~ \> = \<49, 32, 1\> for FR2-1 as an example
for evaluation purpose.

Note3: This table does not apply for evaluations of dynamic SBFD and
dynamic TDD

Note4: The range for the resource ratio per TDD period for SBFD, from
lower to upper, assumes the use of 2 and 0 guard symbols, respectively
for the transition between X and U slot (within last X slot with TDD
period).

A.8 Coupling loss definition
============================

Consider following for the definition of coupling loss
$\text{CL}_{p,u}^{A,B}\left( \mathbf{w}_{A},\mathbf{g}_{B} \right)$ from
Tx antenna port *p* of transmitter *A* to Rx antenna port *u* of
receiver *B:*

If both large scale fading and small scale fading are modelled, the
coupling loss from Tx antenna port p of transmitter *A* to Rx antenna
port u of receiver *B* is defined in formula (1) which is based on
formula (B.1-2) in TR 37.910*.*

$$\begin{matrix}
\text{CL}_{p,u}^{A,B}\left( \mathbf{w}_{A},\mathbf{g}_{B} \right) = PL \bullet \text{SF} \bullet \left( \left| \alpha_{0,u,p} \right|^{2} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\sum_{m = 1}^{M}\left| \alpha_{n,m,u,p} \right|^{2}} \right)\#\left( A - 15 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

If only large scale fading is modelled, the coupling loss from Tx
antenna port *p* of transmitter *A* to Rx antenna port *u* of receiver
*B* is defined in formula (2).

$$\begin{matrix}
\text{CL}_{p,u}^{A,B}\left( \mathbf{w}_{A},\mathbf{g}_{B} \right) = PL \bullet \text{SF} \bullet \left( \left| {\alpha'}_{0,u,p} \right|^{2} \right)\#\left( A - 16 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{\alpha^{'}}_{0,u,p} = \begin{bmatrix}
{\overline{F}}_{\text{rx},u,\theta}\left( \theta_{\text{LOS},\text{ZOA}},\phi_{\text{LOS},\text{AOA}} \right) \\
{\overline{F}}_{\text{rx},u,\phi}\left( \theta_{\text{LOS},\text{ZOA}},\phi_{\text{LOS},\text{AOA}} \right) \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\text{T}} \bullet \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & - 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \bullet \begin{bmatrix}
{\overline{F}}_{\text{tx},p,\theta}\left( \theta_{\text{LOS},\text{ZOD}},\phi_{\text{LOS},\text{AOD}} \right) \\
{\overline{F}}_{\text{tx},p,\phi}\left( \theta_{\text{LOS},\text{ZOD}},\phi_{\text{LOS},\text{AOD}} \right) \\
\end{bmatrix}\#\left( A - 17 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

\- $\mathbf{w}_{A}$
($\mathbf{w}_{A} = \left\lbrack w_{1}^{A},w_{2}^{A},\cdots,w_{N_{T}}^{A} \right\rbrack$)
represents a complex weight vector used for virtualization of Tx antenna
port *p* of transmitter $A$, and $\mathbf{g}_{B}$
($\mathbf{g}_{B} = \left\lbrack g_{1}^{B},g_{2}^{B},\cdots,g_{N_{R}}^{B} \right\rbrack$)
represents a complex weight vector used for virtualization of Rx antenna
port *u* of receiver $B$.

\- Formula (A-17) can be understood according to equation (7.5-29) in
TR38.901.
