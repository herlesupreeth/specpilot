 Foreword
========

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations
=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in 3GPP
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any,
in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**array element:** subdivision of a passive *antenna array*, consisting
of a single radiating element or a group of radiating elements, with a
fixed radiation pattern

**beamwidth:** beam which has a half-power contour that is essentially
elliptical, the half-power beamwidths in the two pattern cuts that
respectively contain the major and minor axis of the ellipse

**front-to-back ratio: ratio of maximum directivity of an antenna to its
directivity in a specified rearward direction**

**gain: ratio of the radiation intensity, in a given direction, to the
radiation intensity that would be obtained if the power accepted by the
antenna were radiated isotropically**

NOTE: If the direction is not specified, the direction of maximum
radiation intensity is implied.

3.2 Symbols
-----------

For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:

*A* Peak normalized array element pattern in dB

*A~A~* Composite *antenna array* pattern in dBi

*A~E~* *Array element* pattern in dBi

### 4.2.2 Propagation model

#### 4.2.2.1 Path loss

The pathloss models are summarized in Table 4.2.2.1-1 and the distance
definitions are indicated in Figures 4.2.2.1-1 and 4.2.2.1-2. Note that
the distribution of the shadow fading is log-normal, and its standard
deviation for each scenario is given in Table 4.2.2.1-1.

#### 4.2.2.3 O-to-I penetration loss

##### 4.2.2.3.1 O-to-I building penetration loss

The pathloss incorporating O2I building penetration loss is modelled as
in the following:

$\text{PL} = \text{P}\text{L}_{b} + \text{P}\text{L}_{\text{tw}} + \text{P}\text{L}_{\text{in}} + N\left( 0,\sigma_{P}^{2} \right)$
(4.2.2-2)

where $\text{P}\text{L}_{b}$ is the basic outdoor path loss given in
clause 4.2.2.1, where $d_{\text{3D}}$ is replaced by
$d_{\text{3D} - \text{out}} + d_{\text{3D} - \text{in}}$ .
$\text{P}\text{L}_{\text{tw}}$ is the building penetration loss through
the external wall, $\text{P}\text{L}_{\text{in}}$ is the inside loss
dependent on the depth into the building, and σ*~P~* is the standard
deviation for the penetration loss.

$\text{P}\text{L}_{\text{tw}}$ is characterized as:

![](./media/image12.png)$\text{\ P}L_{\text{tw}} = PL_{\text{npi}} - 10\log_{10}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\left( p_{i} \times 10^{\frac{L_{material\_ i}}{- 10}} \right)}$
(4.2.2-3)

$\text{P}\text{L}_{\text{npi}}$ is an additional loss is added to the
external wall loss to account for non-perpendicular incidence;
![](./media/image13.png)$\ L_{material\_ i} = a_{material\_ i} + b_{material\_ i} \cdot f$,
is the penetration loss of material *i*, example values of which can be
found in Table 4.2.2.3-1; $p_{i}$ is proportion of *i*-th materials,
where ![](./media/image14.png)$\ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}p_{i} = 1$; and *N* is
the number of materials.

Table 4.2.2.3-1: Material penetration losses

  Material                    Penetration loss \[dB\]
  --------------------------- -------------------------------------
  Standard multi-pane glass   $$L_{\text{glass}} = 2 + 0.2f$$
  IRR glass                   $$L_{\text{IIRglass}} = 23 + 0.3f$$
  Concrete                    $$L_{\text{concrete}} = 5 + 4f$$
  Wood                        $$L_{\text{wood}} = 4.85 + 0.12f$$
  Note: f is in GHz.          

Table 4.2.2.3-2 gives $\text{P}\text{L}_{\text{tw}}$,
$\text{P}\text{L}_{\text{in}}$ and σ*~P~* for two O2I penetration loss
models. The O2I penetration is UT-specifically generated and is added to
the SF realization in the log domain.

$d_{\text{2D} - \text{in}}$ is minimum of two independently generated
uniformly distributed variables between 0 and 25 m for UMa and
UMi-Street Canyon, and between 0 and 10 m for RMa.
$d_{\text{2D} - \text{in}}$ should be UT-specifically generated.

Both low-loss and high-loss models are applicable to UMa and UMi-Street
Canyon.

Only the low-loss model is applicable to RMa.

Only the high-loss model is applicable to InF.

##### 4.2.2.3.2 O-to-I car penetration loss

The pathloss incorporating O2I car penetration loss is modelled as in
the following:

![](./media/image15.png)$\ PL = PL_{b} + Ν\left( \mu,\sigma_{P}^{2} \right)$
(4.2.2-4)

where $\text{P}\text{L}_{b}$ is the basic outdoor path loss given in
clause 4.2.2.1. *μ* = 9, and σ*~P~* = 5. The car penetration loss should
be UT-specifically generated. Optionally, for metallized car windows,
*μ* = 20 can be used. The O2I car penetration loss models are applicable
for at least 0.6 - 60 GHz.

### 4.2.3 Antenna and beam forming pattern modelling

The BS antenna is modelled as described in clause 8.1.1 using parameters
for different BS deployments listed in clause 8.1.2.

The UE antenna is modelled as described in clause 8.2 using isotropic
antenna pattern.

### 4.2.4 Transmission power control model

For downlink scenario, no power control scheme is applied.

For uplink scenario, TPC model specified in clause 9.1 TR 36.942 is
applied with following parameters.

\- CL~x-ile~ = 88 + 10\*log10(200/X) + 11 -- Y, where X is UL
transmission BW (MHz) and Y is the BS noise figure

\- γ = 1

### 4.2.5 Received power model

The received power in downlink and uplink scenarios is defined as below:

RX\_PWR = TX\_PWR -- Path loss + G\_TX + G\_RX

where:

\- RX\_PWR is the received power

\- TX\_PWR is the transmitted power

\- G\_TX is the transmitter antenna gain (directional array gain)

\- G\_RX is the receiver antenna gain (directional array gain).

### 4.2.6 ACLR and ACS modelling

For DL it seems reasonable from the perspective of simulating worst case
scenarios that we assume BS ACLR is modelled as flat in space, and the
UE ACS can be modelled flat in space.

If this assumption is for DL, then the similar assumption could be made
for the UL because:

\- UE has a much small number of antennas, thus the effect of
directivity should be smaller for ACLR (or the adjacent channel
interference). It can also be reasonably assumed that the UE ACLR will
play a dominant role than the BS ACS in the adjacent channel
interference.

> \- Again, BS ACS flat in space might mean worse coexistence
> performance than actual performance because BS has better capability
> of steering its receive antennas to suppress interference.

1 user scheduling is baseline assumption for coexistence evaluation and
the two step ACLR model shown in Table 4.2.6-1 could be used for 3
uplink user scheduling simulation, where a UE occupies a smaller
bandwidth than the channel bandwidth for transmission, to avoid overly
estimating interference, similar as done in E-UTRA coexistence study (as
recorded in TR 36.942).

Table 4.2.6-1: Uplink ACIR value

  Frequency offset between aggressor (91RBs) and victim (91RBs)   ACIR value
  --------------------------------------------------------------- ------------
  0 - 90 RBs                                                      30 + X
  91 - 181RBs                                                     43 + X
  \> 181RBs                                                       43+ X

Therefore, it is assumed that both ACLR (or the adjacent channel
interference) and ACS are flat in both space and frequency. The ACIR
model can be express as:

(assuming ACLR, ACS and ACIR to be linear).

### 4.2.7 Link level performance for 5G NR coexistence

The throughput of a modem with link adaptation can be approximated by an
attenuated and truncated form of the Shannon bound. (The Shannon bound
represents the maximum theoretical throughput than can be achieved over
an AWGN channel for a given SNIR). The following equations approximate
the throughput over a channel with a given SNIR, when using link
adaptation:

![](./media/image17.png)$\text{\ Throughput\ }\left( \text{SNIR} \right),\ bps/Hz\  = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNIR < \ SNIR_{\text{MIN}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \\
 \propto \bullet S\left( \text{SNIR} \right)\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNI}R_{\text{MIN}} \leq SNIR < SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\  \\
 \propto \bullet S\left( \text{SNI}R_{\text{MAX}} \right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNIR\  \geq \ SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

Where:

\- S(SNIR) Shannon bound, S(SNIR) =log~2~(1+SNIR) bps/Hz

\- α Attenuation factor, representing implementation losses

### 4.2.9 Co-existence simulation methodology

Adopt following simulation steps.

1\. Aggressor and victim network are generated.

\- UEs are distributed randomly across the network.

2\. UE associations: UEs are associated to base station based on
coupling loss.

\- Associations are made assuming a single element at BS and UE with
isotropic antenna.

3\. Once association is done, round robin scheduling is used. BF weights
are adjusted to point to the LOS direction between BS-UE. This is done
for both victim and aggressor networks.

4\. Throughput is computed in the victim systems without considering ACI
as below:

\-
$\text{Thput}_{\text{NO~ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack = f\left( \text{SINR}_{\text{ICI}} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N + I_{\text{ICI}}} \right)$,
where $I_{\text{ICI}}$ is the inter-cell interference.

5\. Throughput is computed considering ACI as below:

\-
$\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack = f\left( \text{SINR}_{ICI + ACI} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N + I_{\text{ICI}} + I_{\text{ACI}}} \right)$,
where $I_{\text{ACI}}$ is the adjacent channel interference.

6\. RF parameters are determined based on the degradation cause by ACI
as below:

\-
$\text{Los}s_{\text{ACI}} = 1 - \frac{\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}}{\text{Thput}_{\text{SINGLE}}}$.

5 General parameters
====================

5.1 Duplex mode
---------------

For both frequency ranges, even if FDD is not precluded, it's most
likely that TDD should be used in these frequency ranges.

5.2 Channel Bandwidth
---------------------

A pragmatic, simple and non-ambiguous answers should be provided to
ITU-R. While a number of channel bandwidth would be specified for these
frequency ranges, 100 MHz has been considered as a representative
channel bandwidth that will be used.

5.3 Signal Bandwidth
--------------------

The signal bandwidth for a 100 MHz channel bandwidth signal is
calculated based on the NR spectrum utilization for 30 kHz SCS:

Signal bandwidth = NRB x SCS x 12

with N~RB~: Number of Resource block for 100 MHz channel bandwidth and
30kHz SCS, as specified in TS 38.104 \[3\].

6 BS parameters
===============

6.1 Transmitter characteristics
-------------------------------

### 6.1.1 Power dynamic range

There is no power control in downlink and fixed power per resource block
is assumed in the co-existence simulation. Hence 0 dB power dynamic
range was agreed for the LS reply.

### 6.1.2 Spectral mask

Existing FR1 operating band unwanted emission mask is the same as for
LTE (5 MHz \~ 20 MHz CBW). For both 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5
GHz band, it is foreseen the smaller channel bandwidth such as less than
50 MHz CBW is less attractive. Hence the basic limits for OOB emission
mask should be updated as below. It is agreed that it does not mean that
50 MHz will be the minimum channel bandwidth when RAN4 specified the
channel bandwidth and emission requirements.

6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz for Category A

### 6.1.3 ACLR

According to the simulation results in clause 4.3, it is agreed to
specify 38 dB ACLR for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 37 dB ACLR for 10.0 - 10.5
GHz.

For 6425 -- 7125 MHz and 10 - 10.5 GHz, the ACLR should be higher than
the value specified in table 6.1.3‑1.

### 6.1.4 Spurious emissions

From the Rel-15 discussion, the offset Δf~OBUE~ for the boundary between
OBUE and spurious emissions is the most demanding parameters for OTA or
Hybrid limits AAS BS. Based on the implementation evaluation and
regulatory consideration, it is agreed to adopt **Δf**~OBUE~ = 100 MHz
for both 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz.

Regarding spurious emission requirements for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz, as this
frequency range is still within FR1 band definition, it is agreed to
reuse the existing spurious emission requirements defined in TS 38.104
\[3\] and further update needed are to define upper frequency of Tx
spurious emission to be 26 GHz instead of 5^th^ harmonic of DL frequency
according to ITU-R SM 329-10 \[5\] recommendation. The general spurious
emissions for 6.425-7.125 GHz is defined in Table 6.1.4-1 and Table
6.1.4-3.

Regarding spurious emission requirements for 10-10.5 GHz, according to
ERC 74-01 report \[6\], the lower frequency limit could be defined as 30
MHz. Without any specified spurious limit for AAS BS in between 6 and 24
GHz in ERC 74-01 \[6\], in relation to the existing frequency ranges
specified, with observations of the foreseen implementation of AAS BS
and how they are to be deployed and used, the spurious limits specified
for above 24 GHz with upper frequency limited to 26 GHz will be used for
10.0-10.5 GHz as defined in Table 6.1.4-2 and Table 6.1.4-4.

### 6.1.5 Maximum output power

The maximum output power will be provided in the antenna parameter
table. It was agreed to be aligned with antenna characteristics.

The Total Radiated Power for two polarizations was agreed as shown in
table 6.1.5-1 below.

Table 6.1.5-1: The Total Radiated Power

  Total Radiated Power for two polarizations (dBm)   46                46            37

### 6.1.6 Average output power

It was agreed the average output power won't be mentioned in the reply
LS.

6.2 Receiver characteristics
----------------------------

### 6.2.1 Noise figure

From the TR 38.820 for 7 - 24 GHz, the typical Noise Figure for a Wide
Area BS operating at 10 GHz is 7 dB (12 dB for Medium Range BS and 15 dB
for Local Area BS).

Table 6.2.1-1: Typical noise figure for 7 -- 24 GHz example frequencies

  Example frequency (GHz)   Typical NF values for NR BS (dB)   Typical NF values for NR UE (dB)
  ------------------------- ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  10                        7                                  9
  15                        8                                  10

For 6.425 - 7.125 GHz, the typical Noise Figure for a Wide Area BS
operating at 7 GHz was agreed to be 6 dB (11 dB for Medium Range BS and
14 dB for Local Area BS).

### 6.2.2 Sensitivity

As it is not clear if it will have a conducted sensitivity requirement
for both frequency ranges, however the OTA sensitivity requirement will
be needed either way and will be based on the NF and the antenna gain:

$\ \text{EIS}_{\text{REFSENS}} = P_{\text{kT}} + 10*\log_{10}\left( \text{BW} \right) + NF + IM + SNR - G\ \ \ \ (dBm)$

Where:

\- BW is the configured bandwidth of the FRC,

\- NF is the noise figure,

\- IM is implementation margin not related to antenna array,

\- SNR is the required SNR to reach 95% throughput, and

\- G is the antenna gain including RF losses and 3dB off peak margin.

However, the sensitivity is not a critical parameter for sharing and
compatibility studies. It was agreed to not mention any value for this
parameter.

### 6.2.3 Blocking response

The in-band blocking requirement should apply from F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~
to F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the
FDD *operating band*. It is agreed to adopt Δf~OOB~ = 100 MHz for both
6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz. The in-band blocking levels are
reused from existing FR1 requirements.

The out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to F~UL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz for FR1 bands. -15
dBm CW interfering signal is reused for out-of-band blocking for both
6.425-7.125GHz and 10.0-10.5GHz.

### 6.2.4 ACS

According to the simulation results in clause 4.3, it is agreed to
specify 42 dB ACS for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 40 dB ACLR for 10.0 - 10.5
GHz.

7 UE parameters
===============

7.1 Transmitter characteristics
-------------------------------

### 7.1.1 Power dynamic range

The minimum controlled output power of the UE is defined as the power in
the channel bandwidth for all transmit bandwidth configurations
(resource blocks), when the power is set to a minimum value. For
existing FR1 bands, the minimum output power is -33 dBm for 100 MHz
channel bandwidth. The minimum output power can be reused for both
frequency ranges, 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz, i.e. power
dynamic range is 56 dB for 100 MHz channel bandwidth.

### 7.1.2 Spectral mask

The spectral mask for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz is defined
in below table which is relaxed general NR FR1 spectrum at the F~OOB~
edge ± 0 -- 5 MHz by 3 dB.

For the last 5 MHz of UE SEM, it is agreed that we might revisit the
value pending MRP definition in WI phase.

### 7.1.3 ACLR

According to the simulation results in clause 4.3, it is agreed to
specify 26 dB ACLR for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 24 dB ACLR for 10.0 - 10.5
GHz.

### 7.1.4 Spurious emissions

The general spurious emissions defined in TS 38.101-1 \[4\] clause
6.5.3.1 can apply to both frequency ranges, 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 -
10.5 GHz.

\- 30 MHz ≤ f ≤ 1 GHz: - 36 dBm / 100 kHz

\- 1 GHz ≤ f ≤ 26 GHz: - 30 dBm / 1 MHz

### 7.1.5 Maximum output power

TR 38.820 indicates that 23 dBm is feasible at 10 - 10.5 GHz and this is
an assumption for co-existence analysis. Hence the UE maximum output
power for the considered frequency ranges could be 23 dBm. Other UE
power classes are not precluded for both frequency ranges, 6.425 - 7.125
GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz.

### 7.1.6 Average output power

It was agreed the average output power won't be mentioned in the reply
LS to WP5D.

7.2 Receiver characteristics
----------------------------

### 7.2.1 Noise figure

The noise figure of 9 dB is the baseline assumption and 13 dB is the
optional assumption for co-existence study for 6425 -- 7125 MHz and 10 -
10.5 GHz.

A noise figure in the \[9, 13\] dB interval was finally agreed for
reporting to ITU WP5D sharing studies. Note that the noise figure value
in \[9, 13\] dB interval should be used only for WP5D response. The
actual noise figure to be used to define RF requirements should be
further studied in the WI phase.

### 7.2.2. Sensitivity

The sensitivity is not a critical parameter for sharing and
compatibility studies. It was agreed to not mention any value for this
parameter.

### 7.2.3 Blocking response

The blocking characteristic specified in clause 7.6 of TS 38.101-1 \[4\]
for frequency larger than 3300 MHz could be applied for 6425 -- 7125 MHz
and 10 - 10.5 GHz.

### 7.2.4 ACS

According to the simulation results in clause 4.3, adjacent channel
selectivity (ACS) is agreed as 32 dBc for 6425 -- 7125 MHz and 31 dBc
for 10 - 10.5 GHz.

### 8.1.2 Array antenna parameters

In Table 8.1.2-1, base station array antenna parameters for different
deployment scenarios is listed. Element parameters have been selected to
produce correct element peak gain *determined by calculating the
directivity from a given geometry including beam widths.* The element
directivity can be calculated based on the pattern described by Table
8.1.2-1 in dBi as:

$G_{E,\max} = D_{E,\max} - L_{E}$ (8.1.2-1)

, where the peak directivity *D~E,max~* is calculated from given values
on *ϕ~3dB,~ θ~3dB,~ d~h~ and d~v~* as:

$D_{E,\max} = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi\left\lbrack A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) \right\rbrack_{\max}}{\int_{- \pi}^{\pi}{\int_{0}^{\pi}{A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right)\sin\left( \theta \right)d\theta d\varphi}}} \right)$
(8.1.2-2)

, where *A~lin~(θ,ϕ)* is defined in linear scale as:

$A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = 10^{\frac{A\left( \theta,\varphi \right)}{10}}$
(8.1.2-3)

+----------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------------+

Based on the array parameters sets fundamental characteristics such as
peak EIRP can be derived. For radiated power considerations peak
Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) is calculated in
logarithmical scale calculated as:

$EIRP = P_{\text{tx}} + G_{E,max} + 20\log_{10}\left( \text{MN} \right) + 10\log_{10}\left( P \right)$
(Eq. 8.1.2-4)

, where *P*, *M*, *N*, *P~tx~*, *G~E,max~* is given by Table 8.1.2-1.

8.2 UE antenna characteristics
------------------------------

The outcome of the RAN4 study for collecting technical background
information relevant for the frequency range 7 to 24 GHz indicated that
the frequency range 7.25-\[10-13\] GHz would have "FR1 like"
requirements, and as such we can assume that in the 10 - 10.5 GHz range
this applies. The UE will most likely therefore have a conducted
interface with an assumed isotropic radiation pattern antenna and no
beamforming.

9 Other information relevant for the sharing and compatibility studies
======================================================================

9.1 Spatial emission
--------------------

Traditionally, antenna data sheets provide information on not only the
antenna peak gain in the intended direction but also the gain in
unwanted directions. To describe characteristics in unintended
directions the following metrics are used:

1\. The antenna front-to-back ratio, which is the power ratio of
radiative power in the main beam directions to the power radiated in the
backward direction.

2\. The antenna side lobe ratio, which is the power ratio between the
main beam direction and the power of the strongest side lobe.

However, for an AAS base station it is clear that these traditional
metrics of antenna characteristics are not directly relevant, since an
AAS base station has the ability to adaptively shape the spatial
characteristics to maintain optimum network throughput. Therefore,
additional declarations were defined in TS 38.141-2 \[x\], Annex G. The
additional declarations include information on how much power is
radiated outside the intended coverage region in relation to the power
radiated with in the intended coverage region.

9.2 Interference management
---------------------------

### 9.2.0 General

Given an antenna array with *M* multiplied by *N* identical elements,
the radiation pattern of the array antenna can be described according to
the pattern multiplication theorem as:

$R\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = R_{E}\left( \theta,\varphi \right)R_{A}\left( \theta,\varphi \right)$
(Eq. 9.2.0-1)

, where *R~E~* is the radiation pattern for the array elements and
*R~A~* is the radiation pattern associated to the array factor. The
element patten, *R~E~(θ,ϕ)* is based on a parameterized Gaussian shaped
element, with floors to model for side-lobe levels and front-to-back
ratio. The element peak gain is directivity normalized, hence the peak
element gain *G~E,max~*, element loss *L~E~* and half power beam widths
*θ~3dB~ and ϕ~3dB\ ~*should be selected carefully to maintain correct
antenna gain, as described in subclause 8.1.2.

It can be noticed that both the element factor and the array factor can
be used to shape the composite radiation pattern. The element pattern
can be used to suppress side-lobe characteristics. For a limited
steering range, a sub-array element can be used to suppress side-lobes
better than a single element configuration. Typically for an AAS base
station implementation the element radiation pattern and the array
factor are customized to optimize the coverage within a specific
coverage range for a given deployment scenario.

For a general array antenna, the array factor radiation pattern for
transmitting array antenna with *MN* element per polarization can be
expressed as:

$R_{A}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = \left| \sum_{n = 1}^{\text{MN}}{w_{n}e^{j\mathbf{\text{kr}}}} \right|^{2}$
(Eq. 9.2.0-2)

, where

*-* *w~n~* is the complex array excitation,

**- k** is the wave vector of the transmitted wave, and

**- r** is the element location matrix.

From Eq. 9.2.0-1 it can be noticed that both the element factor and the
array factor can be used to shape the composite radiation pattern, which
will be further described later. The element pattern can be used to
suppress side-lobe characteristics. Typically for an AAS base station
implementation the element radiation pattern and the array factor are
customized to optimize the coverage within a specific coverage range and
coexistence with other services for a given deployment scenario.

For an array antenna with element separation 0.5λ or less the first
side-lobe is the strongest. For uniform amplitude excitation the first
side lobe power level is approximately 13 dB below the main beam power
level. For array antenna with element separation larger than 0.5λ
folding effects will create grating lobes in the side lobe region. The
angular location of the grating lobe is determined by the element
separation and steering angle and the power level of the grating lobes
is determined by the element factor. As an example, in Figure 9.2.0-1,
the impact of element separation is visualised for an 8x8 element
Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) where the vertical beam steering
directions is set to 130 degrees.

pattern

The array factor described by Eq. 9.2.0-2 will produce maximum
directivity for the wanted carrier for which the system is calibrated
minimizing the excitation error. For unwanted emission outside the
carrier the directivity will roll-off gradually to a point where the
array factor directivity is lost.

The relation between array excitation correlation and directivity can be
modelled as described in TR 37.840, subclause 5.4.4.1.4. The average
radiation pattern for different correlation values is plotted in Figure
9.2.0-2. The maximum directivity is achieved for correlation equal to 1
and the minimum directivity equal to the element directivity is achieved
for correlation equal to 0.

**Figure 9.2.0-2:** Relation between excitation correlation and
directivity

To be able to conduct accurate coexistence analysis the unwanted
emission directivity roll-off characteristics is required. The
decorrelation effect in an array antenna will together with traditional
filters provide suppression of unwanted emission EIRP levels required to
guarantee coexistence with other adjacent services.

There is no single general solution available to mitigate all possible
interference situations. Depending on situation one or more mitigation
techniques described in following section can be used to guarantee
coexistence between AAS base stations and other services operating in
adjacent spectrum.

### 9.2.1 Beam nulling

Beam nulling technology is used to suppress the unwanted spatial
emission by inserting nulls in the radiation pattern for the direction
of the interference. One typical applicable scenario is multiple beams
transmission. As shown in Figure 2 as one example, Beam 1 is the serving
beam of UE 1 but the side lobe of beam 1 would interfere the UE2. The
SINR for UE2 will be affected. In order to support high order modulation
scheme such as DL 256 QAM, using beam nulling technology, a null can be
placed at the direction to UE2 for beam 1. The weight of each antenna
array of beam 1 can be obtained by specific algorithms so that SINR of
beam1 is maximized in the direction to UE1 and the transmission power in
the main lobe is maintained, and the side lobe are suppressed in the
direction to UE2. Beam nulling can also be used in the inter-cell or
inter system scenarios as long as the location or direction of the
protected station is known.

### 9.2.2 Amplitude weighting/tapering

AAS offer a wide range of opportunities on optimizing the directivity
patterns through amplitude and phase control. High directivity antenna
array also has side lobes which are often undesirable since they may
cause intra-cell or inter-cell interference. Side lobe levels can be
reduced via tailoring the amplitude across the antenna array which is
often referred as amplitude weighting technology. Whilst amplitude
weighting/tapering reduces the side lobes it also makes the main lobe
wider and hence reduces gain. It needs tradeoff between antenna gain and
side lobe suppression. For example:

![](./media/image21.emf){width="3.029861111111111in"
height="2.26875in"}![](./media/image22.emf){width="2.9923611111111112in"
height="2.238888888888889in"}

Figure 9.2.2-1: Examples for amplitude weighting/tapering: left: Kaiser
(a=3), right: Chebwin (R=35dB)

Applying tapering electrically for the complete array will results in a
main beam peak EIRP drop due to the amplitude window itself. In
addition, the directivity will also reduce as an effect of a wider beam,
as seen in Figure 9.2.2-1.

If tapering is applied at sub-array level the power can be redistributed
between elements in the sub-array, hence no power loss due to tapering
will be introduced.

### 9.2.3 Asymmetric side lobe shaping

In addition to beam tapering, it is possible to manipulate the amplitude
and the phase of the window (for example using modified Taylor series)
to modify the side lobe levels asymmetrically. This technique is widely
used with passive BS arrays to make the ground side lobes larger to fill
in the angles between the main beam and the antenna. The same technique
can be used to minimise radiation in specified unwanted directions. For
example:

![](./media/image23.emf){width="3.029861111111111in" height="2.26875in"}

Figure 9.2.3-1: Example for modified Taylor window

### 9.2.4 Beam restrictions

Depending on base station implementation and intended deployment
scenario different types of beamforming schemes can be considered. For
AAS base stations operating within FR1 (410 to 7125 MHz) typically
codebook or reciprocity-based beamforming will be used for transmitted
down link beams, while for AAS base stations operating within FR2 (24250
to 52600 MHz) typically grid of beams beamforming concepts will be used
for transmitted downlink beams. By restricting the angular range for
which the beams can be transmitted, interference power in unintended
directions can be limited. For codebook-based beamforming codes in the
codebook associated to large beam steering angles can be disabled and
prohibited from being used for transmission. The same principle can be
adopted for grid of beams systems. For reciprocity-based beam forming,
modification to the applied excitations needs to be carried out to avoid
steering directions associated to generation of unintended interference
in the side lobe region.

By limiting the vertical beam steering range within a certain interval,
it is possible to control the level of the grating lobe to a level
similar to other sidelobes. Not using specific beams with large down
tilts angles does not affect the network performance since, other beams
can be used by proving sufficient power using sidelobes close to the
base station. The vertical range in which the side lobe level is
guaranteed will depend on the array antenna geometry used by a specific
base station. As an example (4x8 array, with 3x1 sub-array), in Figure
9.2.4-1 the results of beam restrictions are visualised. In the left
figure all beams are plotted, while in the right figure beams causing
interference towards the sky have been disabled.

### 9.2.5 Irregular array geometries

Instead of using uniform array geometries where all the elements are
assumed to be equal and the elements are located in a rectangular
lattice with given vertical and horizontal element spacing, irregular
array geometries can be used to suppress unintended radiation in the
side lobe region. One example is when the grating lobe response is
suppressed by shifting the columns with a vertical column offset. The
offset can be selected in a way so that the grating lobe reduces.
Instead of concentrating the power in one specific direction the grating
lobe power is spread out in the sidelobe region. The penalty is that the
array antenna aperture size slightly growth compared to the non-shifted
case, as showed in Figure 9.2.5-1. Other examples on irregular array
structures are where different element factor is used for different
locations in the array.

**Figure 9.2.5-1:** Offset applied to columns

As an example (4x8 array, 3x1 sub-array), in Figure 9.2.5-2 the vertical
radiation pattern for 0 degrees down tilt (reference direction) and 12
degrees down tilt (maximum down-tilt direction) is visualized for
uniform structure and irregular structure. For the irregular structure
elements columns have been shifted up and down by an offset vector equal
to \[0, -0.5, 0, -1, 0, 0.5, 0, 1\] wavelengths.

**Figure 9.2.5-2:** Irregular array geometries

It can be noticed that by applying the offset vector the grating lobe is
spread out spatially suppressing the interference in a specific
direction.
