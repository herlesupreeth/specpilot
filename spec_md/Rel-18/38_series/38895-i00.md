 Foreword
========

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document is a technical report for release 18 basket WI High
power UE (power class 1.5) for NR FR1 TDD single band. The purpose is to
gather the relevant background information and studies in order to
complete the band specific requirements for the newly requested bands
for power class 1.5 UE under TDD mode.

4 Background
============

At 3GPP RAN\#97 meeting, a basket Work Item on "High power for FR1 TDD
single bands with power class 1.5 UE" \[2\] was approved for Rel-18. At
3GPP RAN\#98 meeting, the WID is revised \[3\]. The objectives of the
core part are as follows:

Develop RF requirements that are applicable to PC1.5 UE mobile device
and FWA for NR TDD bands.

\- Introduction of high power UE (power class 1.5) operation for NR TDD
bands.

\- Including bands n34, n39, n40 as in table 1. Other bands based on
operators request.

\- Specify RF characteristics with dual-PA assumption, including
following requirements if needed.

\- UE maximum output power

\- Tx power tolerance

\- A-MPR, if needed

\- Reuse existing SAR mechanism.

### 5.3.2 UE additional maximum output power reduction

In 3GPP RAN4 \#104bis meeting, following agreements is approved to
evaluate A-MPR for NS\_50.

\- A-MPR including 5MHz and region need to be re-evaluated.

\- Evaluate the PC1.5 A-MPR requirements for NS\_50 for band n39, using
the Rel-17 RF assumptions for mobile devices.

\- The new PC1.5 A-MPR requirements to be defined for NS\_50 are also
applicable for FWA devices.
