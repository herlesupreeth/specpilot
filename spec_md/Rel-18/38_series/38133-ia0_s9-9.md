9 Measurement Procedure
=======================

9.1 General measurement requirement
-----------------------------------

### 9.1.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements are
split in intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD,
inter-RAT E-UTRAN TDD, and L1-RSRP measurements requirements. These
measurements may be used by the NG-RAN. The measurement quantities are
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], the measurement model is defined in TS
38.300 \[10\], TS 37.340 \[17\] and measurement accuracies are specified
in clause 10. Control of measurement reporting is specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the UE shall perform RRM
measurements and meet the corresponding requirements in clause 9 when
the UE is provided with IDC solution.

In the requirements of clause 9, the exceptions for side conditions
apply as follows:

\- for the UE capable of CA but not configured with any SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.2.1 for UE supporting CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.3 for UE
supporting CA in FR2, respectively;

\- for the UE capable of CA and configured with at least one SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.2.2 for UE configured with CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.4 for
UE supporting CA in FR2, respectively;

\- for the UE capable of SUL but not configured with SUL, the applicable
exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B, clause B.3.4.1
for UE supporting SUL in FR1;

\- for the UE capable of SUL and configured with at least one SUL, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.4.2 for UE configured with SUL in FR1.

The SSB and SMTC in this clause apply for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if the
UE supports *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*.

### 9.1.2 Measurement gap

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE does not support independent measurement gap
patterns for different frequency ranges as specified in table 5.1-1 in
\[18, 19, 20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses
to apply the network must provide a single per-UE measurement gap
pattern for concurrent monitoring of all frequency layers.

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports independent measurement gap patterns
for different frequency ranges as specified in table 5.1-1 in \[18, 19,
20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses to apply
the network must provide either per-FR measurement gap patterns for
frequency range where UE requires per-FR measurement gap for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of each frequency range
independently, or a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of all frequency ranges.

If the UE is configured via LPP \[34\] to measure PRS for any RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement, PRS-RSRPP measurement,
RSCP and RSCPD measurement defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], in order for the
requirements in clauses 9.9.2, 9.9.3, 9.9.4, 9.9.6, 9.9.7 and 9.9.8 to
apply, the network must provide

\- a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent monitoring of
all positioning frequency layers and intra-frequency, inter-frequency
and/or inter-RAT frequency layers of all frequency ranges, or

\- if UE supports independent measurement gap patterns for different
frequency ranges for PRS measurement, i.e. supporting
*independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, per-FR measurement gap pattern for the
frequency range for concurrent monitoring of all positioning frequency
layers and intra-frequency, inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
frequency layers in the corresponding frequency range.

During the per-UE measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding E-UTRAN PCell, E-UTRAN SCell(s) and NR serving cells for
E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity except the reception of signals used for RRM
measurement(s) and the signals used for random access procedure
according to TS 38.321 \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells for SA (with single carrier or CA
configured) except the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s),
PRS measurement(s) and the signals used for random access procedure
according to \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding PCell, SCell(s) and E-UTRAN serving cells for NR-E-UTRA
dual connectivity except the reception of signals used for RRM
measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and the signals used for random
access procedure according to \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells for NR-DC except the reception of signals
used for RRM measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and the signals used for
random access procedure according to \[7\].

During the per-FR measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding E-UTRAN PCell, E-UTRAN SCell(s) and NR serving cells in
the corresponding frequency range for E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity except
the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s) and the signals
used for random access procedure according to TS 38.321 \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells in the corresponding frequency range for
SA (with single carrier or CA configured) except the reception of
signals used for RRM measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and the signals
used for random access procedure according to TS 38.321 \[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding PCell, SCell(s) and E-UTRAN serving cells in the
corresponding frequency range for NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity except the
reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s), PRS measurement(s) and
the signals used for random access procedure according to TS 38.321
\[7\].

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cells in the corresponding frequency range for
NR-DC except the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s), PRS
measurement(s) and the signals used for random access procedure
according to TS 38.321 \[7\].

UEs shall support the measurement gap patterns listed in table 9.1.2-1
based on the applicability specified in tables 9.1.2-2 and 9.1.2-3. UE
determines measurement gap timing based on gap offset configuration and
measurement gap timing advance configuration provided by higher layer
signalling as specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] and TS 36.331 \[16\].

In E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity mode,

\- if per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

In NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity mode,

\- if per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms and UE has NR serving cell in FR1, the measurement
gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the end of the latest NR
subframe occurring immediately before the configured measurement gap
among MCG serving cells subframes in FR1.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms and UE does not have NR serving cell in FR1, the
measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the end of
the latest E-UTRA subframe occurring immediately before the configured
measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes.

\- if per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

In NR-NR dual connectivity mode,

\- If per-UE measurement gap is configured with MG timing advance of
T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~ ms advanced to the
end of the latest MCG subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- If per-FR measurement gap for FR1 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR1 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest MCG subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among MCG serving cells subframes.

\- If per-FR measurement gap for FR2 is configured with MG timing
advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap for FR2 starts at time T~MG~ ms
advanced to the end of the latest SCG subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap among SCG serving cells subframes
in FR2.

T~MG~ is the MG timing advance value provided in *mgta* according to TS
38.331 \[2\].

In determining the measurement gap starting point, UE shall use the DL
timing of the latest E-UTRA or NR subframe occurring immediately before
the configured measurement gap among E-UTRA or NR serving cells.

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE configured with E-UTRA-NR dual
connectivity or NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity, when serving cells are in
E-UTRA and FR1, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2,

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
the measurement gap pattern configured by MN;

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to only
LTE/FR1 serving cell(s),

> \- UE fulfils the measurement requirements for FR1/LTE measurement
> objects based on the configured measurement gap pattern;
>
> \- UE fulfils the requirements for FR2 measurement objects based on
> effective MGRP=20 ms;

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE configured with E-UTRA-NR dual
connectivity, NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity or NR-NR dual connectivity,
when serving cells are in E-UTRA, FR1 and FR2, or in E-UTRA and FR2, or
in FR1 and FR2, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA /FR1 and FR2,

> \- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
> E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
> requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
> the measurement gap pattern configured by MN.

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE in NR standalone operation (with
single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC configuration), for per-FR gap based
measurement, when there is no serving cell in a particular FR, where
measurement objects are configured, regardless if explicit per-FR
measurement gap is configured in this FR, the effective MGRP in this FR
is used to determine requirements;

\- 20 ms for FR2 NR measurements

\- 40 ms for FR1 NR measurements

\- 40 ms for LTE measurements

\- 40 ms for FR1+LTE measurements

For per-FR measurement gap capable UE in NR standalone operation (with
single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC configuration), when serving cells are
in FR1 or FR2, measurement objects are in both E-UTRA /FR1 and FR2,

\- If MN indicates UE that the measurement gap from MN applies to
E-UTRA/FR1/FR2 serving cells, UE fulfils the per-UE measurement
requirements for both E-UTRA/FR1 and FR2 measurement objects based on
the measurement gap pattern configured by MN;

If measurement gap is configured in one FR but measurement object is not
configured in the FR, the scheduling opportunity in the FR depends on
the configured measurement gap pattern.

For single carrier or CA with aligned frame boundaries,

For E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity (with NR single carrier, NR CA
configuration), if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20 ms, 10 ms, 6 ms,
4 ms and 3 ms. And if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on FR1 serving cells in SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N)
= 20 ms, 10 ms, 6 ms, 4 ms and 3 ms, and total interruption time on FR2
serving cells in SCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20 ms, 10
ms, 5.5 ms, 3.5 ms and 1.5 ms.

For NR standalone operation (with single carrier, NR CA and NR-DC
configuration), if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on a serving cell during MGL is defined when MGL(N) = 20 ms, 10 ms,
6 ms, 5.5 ms, 4 ms, 3.5 ms, 3 ms, and 1.5 ms. And if UE is capable of
per-FR-gap, total interruption time on FR1 serving cells during MGL is
defined only when MGL(N) = 20 ms, 10 ms, 6 ms, 4 ms, and 3 ms, and total
interruption time on FR2 serving cells during MGL is defined only when
MGL(N) = 20 ms, 10 ms, 5.5 ms, 3.5 ms, and 1.5 ms.

For NR-E-UTRA dual connectivity (with NR single carrier, NR CA
configuration), if UE is not capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20 ms, 10 ms, 6 ms,
4 ms, and 3 ms. And if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption
time on FR1 serving cells in MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N)
= 20 ms, 10 ms, 6 ms, 4 ms, and 3 ms, and total interruption time on FR2
serving cells in MCG during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 20 ms, 10
ms, 5.5 ms, 3.5 ms, and 1.5 ms.

For CA with non-aligned frame boundaries,

\- The total interruption time on an SCC is the same as the case CA with
aligned frame boundaries, if no SCC slots are partially overlapped with
the measurement gap.

\- The total interruption time on an SCC will be additionally extended
by one SCC slot, if there exist SCC slots partially overlapped with the
measurement gap.

\(a\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0 ms
for all serving cells in synchronous EN-DC, NR standalone operation
(with single carrier, NR CA and synchronous NR-DC configuration) and
synchronous NE-DC, and for serving cells in MCG in NR standalone
operation (with asynchronous NR-DC configuration)

\(b\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0.5 ms
for all serving cells in synchronous EN-DC, NR standalone operation
(with single carrier, NR CA and synchronous NR-DC configuration) and
synchronous NE-DC, and for serving cells in MCG in NR standalone
operation (with asynchronous NR-DC configuration)

\(c\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0 ms
for all serving cells in asynchronous EN-DC and asynchronous NE-DC, and
for serving cells in SCG in NR standalone operation (with asynchronous
NR-DC configuration)

\(d\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0.5 ms
for all serving cells in asynchronous EN-DC and asynchronous NE-DC, and
for serving cells in SCG in NR standalone operation (with asynchronous
NR-DC configuration)

cells for EN-DC, NR standalone operation (with single carrier, NR CA and
NR-DC configuration) and NE-DC

The corresponding total number of interrupted slots on serving cells is
listed in table 9.1.2-4 for all serving cells in synchronous EN-DC, NR
standalone (with single carrier, NR CA and synchronous NR-DC
configuration) and NE-DC, and for serving cells in MCG in NR standalone
operation (with asynchronous NR-DC configuration). The corresponding

It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to conduct
transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when MGTA is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect
to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots
occurring immediately after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than 15
kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15 kHz, in the
L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with
the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after the
slot partially overlapped with measurement gap

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

Note: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

### 9.1.4 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria

#### 9.1.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in clause 9.1.4.2,
the UE shall meet all other performance requirements defined in clause 9
and clause 10. The requirements in this clause also apply for a UE in
EN-DC with PSCell on a carrier frequency with CCA or SA NR with PCell on
a carrier frequency with CCA.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Each measurement identity
corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic reporting, or no
reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each measurement identity
is associated with an event triggering criterion. In case of periodic
reporting, a measurement identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.

#### 9.1.4.2 Requirements

In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in
the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion
(in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case
of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of event,
with the same or different event identities, is counted as separate
reporting criterion in table 9.1.4.2-1.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to table 9.1.4.2-1. For the measurement
categories belonging to intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and inter-RAT
measurements (i.e. without counting other categories that the UE shall
always support in parallel), the UE need not support more than the total
number of reporting criteria as follows:

\- For UE configured with EN-DC:
$E_{\text{cat},\text{EN} - \text{DC},\text{NR}} + E_{\text{cat},\text{EN} - \text{DC},E - \text{UTRA}}$,
where

$E_{cat,EN - DC,NR} = 10 + 9 \times n$ is the total number of NR
reporting criteria configured by PSCell (NR intra- and inter-frequency

### 9.1.5 Carrier-specific scaling factor

This clause specifies the derivation of carrier-specific scaling factor
(CSSF) values, which scales the measurement delay requirements given in
clauses 9.2, 9.2A, 9.3, 9.3A, 9.4, and NR PRS-based positioning
measurements in clause 9.9 and CSI-RS based L3 measurement in clause
9.10 when UE is configured to monitor multiple measurement objects. The
CSSF values are categorized into CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ and
CSSF~within\_gap,i~, for the measurements conducted outside measurement
gaps and within measurement gaps, respectively.

If concurrent measurement gaps are configured by the network, subject to
UE capability, the term of the union of concurrent measurement gaps in
the following clauses refer to non-dropped measurement gap occasions
**after accounting for measurement gap collisions as specified in
clause** 9.1.8.3 from all the configured measurement gap patterns. The
term of the associated measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps in
the following clauses refer to non-dropped measurement gap occasions
**associated by measurement object** *i* **after accounting for
measurement gap collisions as specified in clause** 9.1.8.3.

\- measurement gap is configured by the NW and none of the SMTC
occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by
the measurement gap

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.2.5 for UE
supporting *nr-NeedForInterruptionReport-r18* and reporting
*no-gap-with-interruption* for this intra-frequency layer via
*NeedForInterruptionNR-r18*, when

\- no measuremeng gap is configured by NW, or

are overlapped by the measurement gap, or

> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.3.9 for UE
supporting *nr-NeedForInterruptionReport-r18* and within the band
reporting *no-gap-with-interruption* via *NeedForInterruptionNR-r18*,
when

\- no GAP is configured by NW, or

\- measurement gap is configured by the NW and none of the SMTC
occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object are overlapped by
the measurement gap

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.3.9 for UE
supporting *nr-NeedForInterruptionReport-r18* reporting
*no-gap-with-interruption* for this inter-frequency layer via

\- none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap, or

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap

\- For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, NR SSB-based
inter-RAT measurement object configured by the E-UTRAN PCell on an NR
serving carrier

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- none or part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-RAT measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap;

\- Intra-frequency RSSI and channel occupancy measurement with no
measurement gap on a carrier subject to CCA when SMTC and RMTC are
overlapping and RMTCs are not fully overlapped with measurement gap(s).

\- E-UTRA inter-RAT measurement object without measurement gap as
defined in clause 9.4.8, when

\- no measuremeng gap is configured by NW, or

\- none of the EMW occasions of this inter-RAT measurement object are
overlapped by the measurement gap, or

\- part of the EMW occasions of this inter-RAT measurement object are
overlapped by the measurement gap

The UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object
*i* only outside the measurement gaps.

For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, if a measurement
object configured by PSCell and an NR inter-RAT measurement object
configured by E-UTRAN PCell are on the same serving carrier, they shall
be counted as one intra-frequency measurement object, provided that they
meet the measurement object merging conditions in clause 9.1.3.2.

The number of frequency layers for SSB measurements shall include the
total number of MOs with

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* configured, or

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* not configured *but csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility
configured with associatedSSB*.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

The UE cell identification and measurement periods derived based on
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clauses 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2 and 9.10.2 may be
extended for measurement objects of which the cell identification and
measurement periods are overlapped with T~measure\_SFTD1~ specified in
clause 9.3.8 when no measurement gaps are provided.

The requirements in this clause apply provided that

\- The SMTC on all CCs and inter-frequency layers without measurement
gap in FR2 have the same offset, and one of following conditions is met

\- If *smtc2* is configured on any FR2 CC,

\- All CCs have the same configuration for *smtc1*, and

\- All CCs configured with *smtc2* have the same configuration for
*smtc2*

\- If *smtc2* is not configured on any FR2 CC,

\- The total number of different SMTC periodicities on all serving CCs
and inter-frequency layers without measurement gap does not exceed 4

\- The starting point of the first 5 ms window for CSI-RS measurement as
defined in clause 9.10.1 on all CCs in FR2 is same and one of following
conditions is met

\- If any CSI-RS resource is configured in the second 5 ms window for
CSI-RS measurement as defined in clause 9.10.1 on any FR2 CC,

\- All CCs with CSI-RS resources only in the first 5 ms window have the
same CSI-RS resource periodcity, and

\- All CCs with CSI-RS resources both in the first and the second 5 ms
window have the same CSI-RS resource periodcity

\- If no CSI-RS resource is configured in the second 5 ms window for
CSI-RS measurement as defined in clause 9.10.1 on any FR2 CC,

\- The total number of different CSI-RS resources periodicities on all
serving CCs does not exceed 3.

Note: Longer delays for cell identification and measurement periods
derived based on CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clauses 9.2.5.1, 9.2.5.2, can
be expected, if the UE is configured with more than 4 different SMTC
periodicities on FR2 serving carriers. The longer delay applies for the
FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects with the longest SMTC
periodicity/periodicities.

##### 9.1.5.1.1 EN-DC mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based, CSI-RS based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed outside gaps

For UE configured with the E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, the
carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for intra-frequency
SSB-based measurements, inter-frequency SSB-based measurements performed
outside measurements gaps, intra-frequency CSI-RS L3 measurement and
RSSI/channel occupancy measurement with no measurement gap on a carrier
subject to CCA when SMTC and RMTC are overlapping will be as specified
in table 9.1.5.1.1-1.

##### 9.1.5.1.2 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based, CSI-RS based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed outside gaps

For UE in SA operation mode, the carrier-specific scaling factor
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for intra-frequency SSB-based measurements,
inter-frequency SSB-based measurements performed outside measurements
gaps, E-UTRA inter-RAT measurement object without measurement gap,
intra-frequency CSI-RS L3 measurement and RSSI/channel occupancy
measurement with no measurement gap on a carrier subject to CCA when
SMTC and RMTC are overlapping will be as specified in table 9.1.5.1.2-1,
which shall also be applied for a UE configured with NE-DC operation.

The UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object
*i* only within the measurement gap or the associated measurement gap if
concurrent measurement gaps are configured. If UE is configured with
concurrent measurement gaps and an association between measurement
object *i* and certain measurement gap is provided, the requirements are
defined assuming the UE shall conduct the measurement of this
measurement object *i* within the associated measurement gap.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

Number of SSB layers shall include SSB for mobility and associated SSB
for CSI-RS mobility. The ssbfrequency is counted only once if the
ssbfrequency for mobility and associated SSB are the same, or
ssbfrequency and smtc in multiple MOs are the same.

SSB-based measurement and CSI-RS based measurement for mobility
configured in the same measurement object are considered as different
layers.

##### 9.1.5.2.1 EN-DC mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB, CSI-RS-based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed within gaps

The scaling value CSSF~within\_gap,i~ below has been derived without
considering GSM inter-RAT carriers.

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*.

For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, if a SSB-based
measurement object configured by PSCell and an NR SSB-based inter-RAT
measurement object configured by E-UTRAN PCell are on the same carrier,
they shall be counted as one measurement object in M~tot,i,j~, provided
that they meet the measurement object merging conditions in clause
9.1.3.2.

If measurement object *i* refers to an RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs\>160 ms or with periodicity Tprs=160 ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is
configured, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~
for other measurement objects (including RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs=160 ms) participate in the gap competition are derived
as below.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with periodicity Tprs=160 ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160 ms period,
count the total number of intra-frequency measurement objects and
inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects which are candidates to be
measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR carriers,
if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is
configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the
value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise the assumed
periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc1*.

\- An NR measurement object with CSI-RS measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- An NR measurement object with RSSI and channel occupancy measurement
is a candidate to be measured in a gap if the RMTC duration is fully
covered by MGL excluding RF switching time

\- An inter-RAT UTRA measurement object configured by E-UTRA PCell
\[15\] is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- An inter-frequency E-UTRA measurement object configured by E-UTRA
PCell \[15\] is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects,
including both SSB, CSI-RS based and RSSI/CO measurement, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB
and CSI-RS based NR inter-RAT frequency layer and RSSI/CO measurement,
configured by E-UTRA PCell, EUTRA inter-frequency measurement objects
configured by E-UTRA PCell, or UTRA inter-RAT measurement objects
configured by E-UTRA PCell which are candidates to be measured in gap
*j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise
M~inter,i,j~ equals 0.

\- A measurement object *i* in M~intra,i,j~ and in M~inter,i,j~ is
counted twice if the measurement object is configured with both RMTC and
SMTC which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT frequency layers which
are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object
*i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with periodicity Tprs=160 ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160 ms period,
M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurement
object, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~ ≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

Where R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the number of
measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate and not used
for RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with periodicity
Tprs=160 ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary
1280 ms period.

##### 9.1.5.2.2 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB, CSI-RS-based L3 measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~+ N~L1\_SSB~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~L1\_SSB~ is the number of FR2 SSB based inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurements configured in the same FR as FR2 measurement object *i.*

If a UE capable of concurrent gaps is configured with concurrent gaps,
the carrier specific scaling factor is calculated separately for each
gap pattern, provided that the association between measurement objects
and gap pattern is configured by network. Only the measurement objects
associated to the same measurement gap pattern are counted when deriving
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for a target measurement object with index *i.. In
case of collision between concurrent measurement gaps, some measurement
gap occasions may be dropped according to clause 9.1.8.3. The dropped
gap occasions will not be used in deriving CSSF~within\_gap,i.~*

If measurement object *i* refers to a long-periodicity measurement which
is any of:

\- an E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with
periodicity Tprs=160 ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured, or

\- an NR measurement for positioning frequency layer *i* with
T~available\_PRS,i~ \>160ms, where T~available\_PRS,i~ is defined in
clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP ,UE
Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements, respectively.

then CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for other
measurement objects (including E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs=160 ms) participate in the gap competition and the
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ are derived as below.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier

clause 9.4.4.1.2.2 and T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ specified in clause
9.4.4.2.2.2, where k is the carrier frequency where the UE is performing
cell detection of the inter-RAT E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference
cell when acquiring the subframe and slot timing of the cell according
to clause 9.4.4. In this case, the UE cell identification and

##### 9.1.5.2.3 NE-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based and CSI-RS based L3 measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*.

If measurement object *i* refers to a long-periodicty measurement which
is any of:

\- an E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with
periodicity Tprs=160 ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured, or

\- an NR measurement for positioning frequency layer *i* with
T~available\_PRS,i~ \>160 ms, where T~available\_PRS,i~ is defined in
clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5 ,9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP ,UE
Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements, respectively.

then CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for other
measurement objects (including E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs=160 ms) participate in the gap competition are derived as below.

When multiple positioning frequency layers are configured,

\- for each positioning frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is
derived with the following steps assuming no other positioning frequency
layer is configured.

\- for each RRM frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is derived as
follows:

\- an intermediate CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~ is derived with the following
steps assuming only positioning frequency layer *k* is configured, and

\- CSSF~within\_gap,i~= max(CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~), where *k*=0...K-1,
and K is the number of configured positioning frequency layers.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, count the total number of intra-frequency measurement
objects and inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR PRS
measurements on all positioning frequency layers which are candidates to
be measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- An NR measurement object with CSI-RS measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- An inter-RAT measurement object is a candidate to be measured in all
measurement gaps.

\- An inter-frequency E-UTRA measurement object is a candidate to be
measured in all measurement gaps.

\- A positioning frequency layer is counted as candidate for a MG
occasion if at least one PRS resource on that positioning frequency
layer is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the counting
is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured with per UE
gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis. For UEs which support and
are configured with per FR gaps, the CSSF requirements do not apply when
NR PRS measurement in one FR gap collides with SSB/CSI-RS/PRS
measurements in the other FR gap in time domain.

If the number of configured inter-frequency and interRAT measuerement
objects and NR PRS measurements on all positioning frequency layers is
non-zero and the UE is configured with per UE gaps, or if the UE is
configured with per FR gaps:

FR1 and FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects belong to group A

Inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects belong to group B

M~groupA,i,j~: Sum of the number of FR1 intra-frequency measurement
objects M~intra-FR1,i,j~ and the number of FR2 intra-frequency
measurement objects M~intra-FR2,i,j~ , including both SSB and CSI-RS
based, which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupA,i,j~
equals 0.

M~groupBi,j~: Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB and
CSI-RS based, E-UTRA inter-RAT and UTRA inter-RAT measurement objects,
up to one positioning frequency layer, which are candidates to be
measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is also a
candidate. Otherwise M~groupB,i,j~ equals 0.

If the number of configured inter-frequency and inter-RAT measuerement
objects and NR PRS measurements on all positioning frequency layers is

M~intra-FR1,i,j~ , including both SSB and CSI-RS based, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupA,i,j~ equals 0.

M~groupBi,j~ : The number of FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects
M~intra-FR2,i,j~ , including both SSB and CSI-RS based, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is
also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupB,i,j~ equals 0.

M~tot,i,j~ = M~groupA,i,j~ + M~groupB,i,j~ : Total number of group A and
group B measurement objects which are candidates to be measured in gap
*j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise
M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier
specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is a group A measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~groupA,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupB,i,j~≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~groupA,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupB,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an group B measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~groupBi,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~ ≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~groupB,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

Where R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the number of
measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate and not used
for a long-periodicity measurement defined above.

##### 9.1.5.2.4 NR-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based and CSI-RS-based L3 measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object *i* that are
measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the measurement requirements is
defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~+ N~L1\_SSB~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object *i*.

\- N~L1\_SSB~ is the number of FR2 SSB based inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurements configured in the same FR as FR2 measurement object *i.*

If measurement object *i* refers to a long-periodicity measurement which
is any of:

\- an E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with
periodicity Tprs=160 ms but *prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured, or

\- an NR measurement for positioning frequency layer *i* with
T~available\_PRS,i~ \>160 ms, where T~available\_PRS,i~ is defined in
clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.3.5 ,9.9.4.5 and 9.9.6.5 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP , UE
Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements, respectively.

then CSSF~within\_gap,i~=1. Otherwise, the CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for other
measurement objects (including E-UTRA RSTD measurement with periodicity
Tprs=160 ms) participate in the gap competition and the
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ are derived as below.

When multiple positioning frequency layers are configured,

\- for each positioning frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is
derived with the following steps assuming no other positioning frequency
layer is configured.

\- for each RRM frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is derived as
follows:

\- an intermediate CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~ is derived with the following
steps assuming only positioning frequency layer *k* is configured, and

\- CSSF~within\_gap,i~= max(CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~), where *k*=0...K-1,
and K is the number of configured positioning frequency layers.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with periodicity Tprs=160 ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160 ms period,
count the total number of intra-frequency measurement objects and
inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR PRS measurements on
all positioning frequency layers and inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement
layers which are candidates to be measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- An NR measurement object with CSI-RS measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- A positioning frequency layer is counted as candidate for a MG
occasion if at least one PRS resource on that positioning frequency
layer is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- An inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer is a candidate to be
measured in a gap if the window confining SSB resource is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the counting
is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured with per UE
gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis. For UEs which support and
are configured with per FR gaps, the CSSF requirements do not apply when
NR PRS measurement in one FR gap collides with SSB/CSI-RS/PRS
measurements in the other FR gap in time domain.

If the number of configured inter-frequency and interRAT measuerement
objects and NR PRS measurements on all positioning frequency layers is
non-zero and the UE is configured with per UE gaps, or if the UE is
configured with per FR gaps:

FR1 and FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects belong to group A

Inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects and up to one NR PRS
measurement on any one positioning frequency layer belong to group B

M~groupA,i,j~: Sum of the number of FR1 intra-frequency measurement

equals 0.

and CSI-RS based, E-UTRA inter-RAT and UTRA inter-RAT measurement
objects and up to one positioning frequency layer, inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement layers, which are candidates to be measured in gap
*j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise
M~groupB,i,j~ equals 0.

Editor Note: The current M~inter,i,j~ assumes all cells in the same
frequency layer have the same SSB periodicity. FFS whether and how to
address the case of different periodicities. If the number of configured
inter-frequency and interRAT measuerement objects and NR PRS
measurements on all positioning frequency layers is zero and the UE is
configured with per UE gaps:

0.For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier
specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

#### 9.1.5.3 Monitoring of multiple layers within NCSG

The measurement requirements derived from CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ defined
in this clause are applicable provided that network provides NCSG
pattern for measurement.

For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and when a gap

as defined in clause 9.2.1 corresponding to an activated serving cell,
when

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
for an intra-frequency measurement object, and *smtc1* is fully
overlapping with NCSG and *smtc2* is partially overlapping with NCSG,
requirements derived from CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ and CSSF~outside\_gap,i~

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within NCSG, the

described in this clause.

If a UE capable of *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* is configured with a gap
combination including one or more NCSGs, the carrier specific scaling
factor is calculated separately for each gap pattern, provided that the
association between measurement objects and gap pattern is configured by
network. Only the measurement objects associated to the same NCSG
pattern are counted when deriving CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ for a target
measurement object with index *i. In case of collision between
concurrent GAPs, some GAP occasions may be dropped according to clause
9.1.13.3. The dropped NCSG occasions will not be used in deriving*
CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~.

For each NCSG occasion *j*, count the total number of intra-frequency
measurement objects and inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects
which are candidates to be measured within the occaison *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in an NCSG occasion if its SMTC duration is

the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise the assumed periodicity of
SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc1*.

\- An inter-RAT E-UTRA measurement object configured is a candidate to
be measured in all NCSG occasions.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects which are
candidates to be measured in NCSG occasion *j* where the measurement
object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter,i,j~: Number of NR inter-frequency measurement objects and
E-UTRA inter-RAT measurement objects which are candidates to be measured
in NCSG occasion *j* where the measurement object *i* is also a
candidate. Otherwise M~inter,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~: Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects which
are candidates to be measured in NCSG occasion *j* where the measurement
object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR NCSG, the above
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE NCSG the counting is done on a per UE basis.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~=
max(M~tot,i,j~), where *j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in NCSG occasions where M~inter,i,j~≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- M~intra,i,j~ in NCSG occasions where M~inter,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurement
object, CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ is the maximum among

where *j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- M~inter,i,j~ in NCSG occasions where M~intra,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/VIRP)-1

\- K~intra~ and K~inter~ are defined in clause 9.1.2.1a.

#### 9.1.5.4 L1-RSRP measurements within measurement gap

The requirements in this clause apply for SSB-based L1-RSRP measurements
within measurement gap for LTM in clause 9.15.5.

When SSB-based L1-RSRP measurements are configured on one or more
frequecny layers within measurement gap, the carrier sepcific scaling
factor for a target L1-RSRP measurement on a inter-frequency layer with
index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is derived in this
chapter, with the consideration of the impact from the following
measurement types:

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with no measurement gap

requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

In derivation of CSSF~within\_gap,i~ , number of SSB layers shall
include SSB for mobility and that as associated SSB for CSI-RS mobility.
The *ssbfrequency* is counted only once if the ssbfrequency for mobility
and associated SSB are the same, or *ssbfrequency* and *smtc* in
multiple MOs are the same.

##### 9.1.5.4.1 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for L1-RSRP measurements performed within measurement gap

When one or more inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layers are
monitored within measurement gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor
for a target inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer with index *i* is
designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is derived as described in this
clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement layer *i* that are measured based on effective MGRP as
defined in clause 9.1.2, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for deriving the
measurement requirements is defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~
+ N~L1\_SSB~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement, and

\- N~L1\_SSB~ is the number of SSB based inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurements configured in the same FR as measurement object *i.*

When multiple positioning frequency layers are configured,

\- for each SSB based inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement i,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is derived as follows:

\- an intermediate CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~ is derived with the following
steps assuming only positioning frequency layer *k* is configured, and

> \- CSSF~within\_gap,i~= max(CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~), where *k*=0...K-1,
> and K is the number of configured positioning frequency layers.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, count the total number of intra-frequency measurement
objects and inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR PRS
measurements on all positioning frequency layers and inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement layers which are candidates to be measured within
the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- An NR measurement object with CSI-RS measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- An NR measurement object with RSSI and channel occupancy measurement
is a candidate to be measurement in a gap if the RMTC duration is fully
covered by MGL excluding RF switching time

\- An inter-frequency SFTD measurement object, if to be measured with
measurement gaps, is a candidate to be measured in all measurement gaps.

\- A positioning frequency layer is counted as candidate for a MG
occasion if at least one PRS resource on that positioning frequency
layer is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- An inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer is a candidate to be
measured in a gap if all configured SSB resources on that frequency
layer to be measured are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching
time.

\- For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the
counting is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured
with per UE gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects,
including both SSB, CSI-RS based and RSSI/CO measurements, which are
candidates to be measured in gap *j* where inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement layer *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals
0.

\- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB
and CSI-RS based, EUTRA inter-RAT and UTRA inter-RAT frequency layers,
up to one positioning frequency layer, RSSI/CO measurements,
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layers, which are candidates to be
measured in gap *j* where the inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer
*i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~inter,i,j~ equals 0.

> \- In FR1, an inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer is not counted
> in M~inter,i,j~ if the SSB resource instance configured for L1-RSRP
> measurement of an inter-frequency layer is overlapped with the

> to be measured in gap *j*.

Editor Note: The current M~inter,i,j~ assumes all cells in the same
frequency layer have the same SSB periodicity. FFS whether and how to
address the case of different periodicities.

\- A measurement object *i* in M~intra,i,j~ and in M~inter,i,j~ is
counted twice if the measurement object is configured with both RMTC and
SMTC which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer *i* is also a candidate

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT frequency layers and up
to one NR PRS measurement on any one positioning frequency layer,
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layers, which are candidates to be
measured in gap *j* where the inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer
*i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier
specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\[If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- L1-RSRP measurement layer *i* is an SSB based inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement layer, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~ ≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1 \]

Where R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer *i* is a candidate to be
measured over the number of measurement gap where inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement layer *i* is a candidate and not used for a
long-periodicity measurement defined above.

##### 9.1.5.4.2 NR-DC: carrier-specific scaling factor for L1-RSRP measurements performed within measurement gap

When one or more inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layers are
monitored within measurement gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor
for a target measurement object or a target inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement layer with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~
and is derived as described in this clause.

For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement layer *i* that are measured based on effective MGRP as
defined in clause 9.1.2, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ used for derving the
measurement requirements is defined as 2\*N~with\_CSI-RS~ + N~SSB\_only~
+ N~L1\_SSB~, where

\- N~with\_CSI-RS~ is the number of measurement objects with either both
SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3 measurement
configured in the same FR as, and

\- N~SSB\_only~ is the number of measurement objects with only SSB based
L3 measurement, and

\- N~L1\_SSB~ is the number of SSB based inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurements configured in the same FR as measurement object *i.*

When multiple positioning frequency layers are configured,

\- for each SSB based inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer *i*,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is derived as follows:

\- an intermediate CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~ is derived with the following
steps assuming only positioning frequency layer *k* is configured, and

\- CSSF~within\_gap,i~= max(CSSF~within\_gap,i,k~), where *k*=0...K-1,
and K is the number of configured positioning frequency layers.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs\>160 ms or with periodicity Tprs=160 ms but
*prs-MutingInfo-r9* is configured within an arbitrary 160 ms period,
count the total number of intra-frequency measurement objects and
inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR PRS measurements on
all positioning frequency layers and inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement
layers which are candidates to be measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- An NR measurement object with CSI-RS measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- A positioning frequency layer is counted as candidate for a MG
occasion if at least one PRS resource on that positioning frequency
layer is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- An inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer is a candidate to be
measured in a gap if all configured SSB resources on that frequency
layer to be measured are fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching
time.

For UEs which support and are configured with per FR gaps, the counting
is done on a per FR basis, and for UEs which are configured with per UE
gaps the counting is done on a per UE basis.

If the number of configured inter-frequency and interRAT measuerement
objects and NR PRS measurements on all positioning frequency layers is
non-zero and the UE is configured with per UE gaps, or if the UE is
configured with per FR gaps:

FR1 and FR2 intra-frequency measurement objects belong to group A

Inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurement objects and up to one NR PRS
measurement on any one positioning frequency layer and \[inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement layers\] belong to group B

M~groupA,i,j~: Sum of the number of FR1 intra-frequency measurement
objects M~intra-FR1,i,j~ and the number of FR2 intra-frequency
measurement objects M~intra-FR2,i,j~ , including both SSB and CSI-RS
based, which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~groupA,i,j~
equals 0.

M~groupBi,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB
and CSI-RS based, E-UTRA inter-RAT and UTRA inter-RAT measurement
objects and up to one positioning frequency layer, inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement layers, which are candidates to be measured in gap
*j* where the inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer *i* is also a
candidate. Otherwise M~groupB,i,j~ equals 0.

\- In FR1, an inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer is not counted
in M~inter,i,j~ if the SSB resource instance configured for L1-RSRP
measurement of an inter-frequency layer is overlapped with the
measurement object of this inter-frequency layer which are candidates to
be measured in gap *j*.

\- In FR2, an inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer in M~inter,i,j~
contributes the number equal to the cell number for L1-RSRP measurement
in this inter-frequency layer, which is candidate to be measured in gap
*j*.

Editor Note: The current M~inter,i,j~ assumes all cells in the same
frequency layer have the same SSB periodicity. FFS whether and how to
address the case of different periodicities.

M~tot,i,j~ = M~groupA,i,j~ + M~groupB,i,j~ : Total number of group A and
group B measurement objects and inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement
layers which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where the
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer *i* is also a candidate.
Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra,i,j~ = M~inter,i,j~ = M~tot,i,j~ =0. The carrier
specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\[If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer *i*, is an group B L1-RSRP
measurement layer, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~groupBi,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~ ≠0,
where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~groupB,i,j~) in gaps where M~groupA,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1\]

R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement layer *i*, is a candidate to be
measured over the number of measurement gap where inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement layer *i*, is a candidate and not used for a
long-periodicity measurement defined above.

### 9.1.6 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within gaps or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within NCSG or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

The carrier-specific scaling factor specified in clause 9.1.5 that
applies to the other impacted measurement objects will also apply based
on the longer measurement or cell identification delay before or after
the transition.

When the UE transitions between DRX and non-DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements apply based on the longer delay before or after the
transition.

Subsequent to this measurement period, the cell identification and
measurement period requirements on each measurement object are
corresponding to the second mode after transition.

For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, when the intra-frequency
measurement transitions from measurements performed on CD-SSB to
measurements performed on NCD-SSB or vice versa due to BWP switching or
SCG activation/deactivation during one cell identification period or
measurement period, the UE shall use a cell identification period that
is the maximum of the cell identification periods or measurement periods
corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after the
BWP switching or SCG activation/deactivation.

Subsequent to the above-mentioned measurement periods and/or cell
identification periods, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements on each measurement object are based on the SSB type after
the BWP switch or SCG activation/deactivation.

### 9.1.7 Pre-configured measurement gap

#### 9.1.7.1 Introduction

A UE capable of Pre-configured measurement gap (Pre-MG) pattern can be
configured with a Pre-MG pattern via RRC signalling \[2\].

The gap interruption requirements in clause 9.1.2 apply to Pre-MG when
Pre-MG is activated, and no gap interruption is expected when Pre-MG is
deactivated.

\- The requirements apply for NR standalone operation with single
carrier and NR CA.

#### 9.1.7.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements related to pre-configured measurement gap apply
provided:

\- UE indicates support of *preconfiguredUE-AutonomousMeasGap* \[2\]
and/or *preconfiguredNW-ControlledMeasGap* \[2\], and

\- either a single per-UE measurement gap is pre-configured by the
network, or one or two per-FR measurement gaps are pre-configured by the
network, and

\- one of measurement gap patterns among measurement gap patterns \#0 \~
\#25 is configured for pre-configured measurement gap, and

\- UE is in NR SA with single carrier or with NR CA.

A measurement gap is configured as pre-configured measurement gap if
*preConfigInd* is indicated by network in the configuration message of
the measurement gap.

If UE indicates support of only *preconfiguredNW-ControlledMeasGap*
\[2\], UE can expect the network to configure *preConfGapStatus*.

If a measurement gap is configured as pre-configured measurement gap,
the applicability of measurement gap patterns is defined in table
9.1.2-3.

When a pre-configured measurement gap is used to perform PRS
measurements, the UE will inform the network that it is going to
start/stop PRS measurements with the configured pre-configured
measurement gap by initiating the existing
*LocationMeasurementIndication* procedure.

If the Pre-MG status changes during a measurement period of a
measurement that can be performed without and within measurement gaps,
the UE is allowed to restart the measurement.

If the Pre-MG status changes from activated to deactivated during a
measurement period of a measurement that can only be performed within
measurement gaps, the measurement requirements do not apply.

#### 9.1.7.3 Requirements

Any of the measurement Gap pattern \#0 to \#25 defined in table 9.1.2-1
can be configured as Pre-MG pattern.

The UE can determine the Pre-MG status based on autonomous
activation/deactivation mechanism or based on network-controlled
activation/deactivation mechanism.

A UE capable of both autonomous and network-controlled mechanisms for
activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern will not use autonomous rules
to determine the activation/deactivation status of the pre-configured MG
if the network provides the activation/deactivation status via RRC
indication *preConfGapStatus* for all the DL BWPs of all the activated
CCs, and for all the deactivated SCCs.

##### 9.1.7.3.1 Requirements for autonomous activation/deactivation mechanism

Requirements in this clause apply when autonomous mechanism \[2\] is
used for activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern.

The UE can autonomously change the Pre-MG status from activation to
deactivation or vice versa based on any of the following triggering
conditions listed below. The UE shall also autonomously determine the
Pre-MG status based on all the concurrent triggering conditions
occurring jointly:

\- DCI, timer or RRC based active BWP switching,

\- Activation/deactivation of SCell(s),

\- Addition/removal of any measurement object(s)

\- Addition/release/change of a SCell in carrier aggregation,

The UE shall autonomously determine the status of the per-UE Pre-MG
pattern as deactivated immediately after the configuration of the per-UE
Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering conditions above is
satisfied provided that all the configured measurements can be performed
without measurement gaps. The UE shall autonomously determine the status
of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern as deactivated immediately after the
configuration of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering
conditions above is satisfied provided that all the configured
measurements in the same FR can be performed without measurement gaps.

A measurement can be performed by the UE without measurement gaps if any
of the following conditions is met:

\- The UE is configured with SSB based intra-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based intra-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.2.1 are met, or

\- The UE is configured with SSB based inter-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based inter-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.3.1 are met, or

\- The UE is configured with CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements.

The UE shall autonomously determine the status of the per-UE Pre-MG
pattern as activated immediately after the configuration of the per-UE
Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering conditions above is
satisfied provided that at least one of the configured measurements
cannot be performed without measurement gaps. The UE shall autonomously
determine the status of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern as activated
immediately after the configuration of the per-FR Pre-MG pattern or when
any of the triggering conditions above is satisfied provided that at
least one of the configured measurements in the same FR cannot be
performed without measurement gaps.

A measurement cannot be performed by the UE without measurement gaps if
any of the following conditions is met:

\- The UE is configured with SSB based intra-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based intra-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.2.1 are not met, or

\- The UE is configured with SSB based inter-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based inter-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.3.1 are not met, or

\- The UE is configured with any of the following measurements:

\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurements, or

\- E-UTRA Inter-RAT measurements, or

\- UTRA Inter-RAT measurements.

##### 9.1.7.3.2 Requirements for network-controlled activation/deactivation mechanism

The requirements in this clause apply when network-controlled mechanism
\[2\] is used for activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern.

For per-UE Pre-configured MG,

\- the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is activated if
*preConfGapStatus* is set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for the
active DL BWP of any of the activated CCs, or if *preConfGapStatus* is
set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for any of the deactivated SCCs,

\- otherwise, the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is
deactivated

For per-FR Pre-configured MG,

\- the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is activated if
*preConfGapStatus* is set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for the
active DL BWP of any of the activated CCs in the corresponding FR, or if
*preConfGapStatus* is set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for any of
the deactivated SCCs in the corresponding FR,

\- otherwise, the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is
deactivated

##### 9.1.7.3.3 Requirements for reception/transmission during activation/deactivation

The requirements in this clause apply when autonomous mechanism or
network-controlled mechanism is used for activation/deactivation \[2\]
of Pre-MG pattern.

If per-UE Pre-MG pattern is activated then the UE is not required to
conduct reception/transmission from/to the corresponding serving cells
during the gap occasion according to the same principles as described
for per-UE measurement gaps in clause 9.1.2. Otherwise, the UE can be
scheduled for reception/transmission of signals in all the serving cells
during the gap occasion.

If per-FR Pre-MG pattern is activated then the UE is not required to
conduct reception/transmission from/to the corresponding serving cells
during the gap occasion on the same FR according to the same principles
as described for per-FR measurement gaps in clause 9.1.2. Otherwise, the
UE can be scheduled for reception/transmission of signals in all the
serving cells during the gap occasion in the same FR.

### 9.1.8 Concurrent measurement gaps

#### 9.1.8.1 Introduction

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap pattern capability, network
can provide multiple measurement gaps configured by RRC message(s) as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Requirements in this clause apply when the
UE is in SA operation mode.

#### 9.1.8.2 Requirements

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports *concurrentPerUE-OnlyMeasGap-r17* as
specified in \[14\], in order for the requirements in the following
clauses to apply, the network can provide at most two per-UE measurement
gap patterns for monitoring of all frequency layers.

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports
*concurrentPerUE-PerFRCombMeasGap-r17* as specified in \[14\], in order
for the requirements defined for concurrent measurement gaps to apply,
the network can provide the measurement gap pattern combinations
specified in table 9.1.8-1 for monitoring of all frequency layers.

| provided that  |                |                |                |

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For UE configured in the SA operation mode, when monitoring of multiple
inter-RAT E-UTRAN carrier frequency layers, intra-frequency NR carrier
frequency layers and/or inter-frequency NR carrier frequency layers as
configured by PCell using gaps, each monitored carrier frequency layer,
including *following measurement types:*

\- a measurement object with SSB based measurement,

\- a measurement object with CSI-RS based measurement,

\- E-UTRA inter-RAT measurement object,

\- E-UTRAN inter-RAT RSTD measurement,

\- NR PRS-based positioning measurements,

can be only associated to one measurement gap pattern. Requirements for
concurrent measurement gaps apply provided that each frequency layer is
only associated with one concurrent measurement gap. There can be one or
more frequency layers associated with each concurrent measurement gap.
Furthermore, if the UE is not capable of concurrentMeasGapEUTRA-r17
\[2\], all E-UTRAN measurement objects shall be associated with a single
concurrent gap pattern for the requirement to apply.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns, each measurement
gap pattern supported by the UE is listed in table 9.1.2-1 based on the
applicability specified in table 9.1.2-3.

The requirements in clause 9.1.2 are also applicable for the UE capable
of and configured with multiple concurrent measurement gap patterns
within each measurement gap pattern.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns and configured with
more than 1 measurement gap pattern per FR or per-UE according to table
9.1.8-1, requirements does not apply if the UE is configured with more
than one measurement gap pattern (MGP) with measurement gap repetition
period (MGRP) of 20 ms in an FR.

#### 9.1.8.3 Collision between concurrent measurement gaps

Collisions between occasions of two concurrent measurement gaps may
occur as specified in this clause if the two measurement gaps are

\- two per-UE measurement gaps, or

\- two per-FR measurement gaps in the same FR, or

\- one per-UE measurement gap and one per-FR measurement gap.

When UE is configured with concurrent measurement gaps, two measurement
gap occasions are considered colliding if at least one of the following
conditions is met:

\- the two occasions are fully or partially overlapping in time domain,
or

\- the distance between the two occasions is equal to or smaller than 4
ms.

The distance between two measurement gap occasions is defined as the
time difference between the ending point of the first occasion and the
starting point of the second occasion, where the first measurement gap
occasion occurs earlier in time than the second measurement gap
occasion.

In case of collision between two measurement gap occasions, the UE shall
perform measurements in the occasion of the measurement gap with higher
priority, and the occasion of the measurement gap with lower priority
shall be dropped. The UE shall be able to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or
receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI in the corresponding NR serving
cells in the slots that are not interrupted according to requirements in
clause 9.1.8.4.

The requirements of concurrent measurement gaps in clause 9 shall not
apply when a gap without assigned priority is configured simultaneously
with any other gap(s) that affect serving carriers in the same FR and
the measurement gaps are colliding with each other.

The priority for a measurement gap is configured by networks via
*gapPriority* in *GapConfig*. The requirements with concurrent
measurement gaps apply provided that two measurement gaps colliding with
each other are configured with different priorities.

#### 9.1.8.4 Measurement gap related requirements of concurrent measurement gaps

A slot is considered as interrupted if it is interrupted by an occasion
of any of the configured concurrent measurement gaps following the
measurement gap interruption requirements in clause 9.1.2, except for a
dropped measurement gap occasion.

### 9.1.9 Network controlled small gap

#### 9.1.9.1 Introduction

The UE capable of network controlled small gap (NCSG) pattern can be
configured with a NCSG pattern via RRC signalling \[2\].

This clause contains the general requirements on the UE regarding to
Network Controlled Small Gap (NCSG).

The requirements in this clause are applicable for UE configured with SA
NR (with single carrier or NR CA) operation mode.

It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to conduct
transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when *mgta* is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with
respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the
DL slots occurring immediately after the last each of the interrupted
slots after VIL1 and VIL2.

\- when *mgta* is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than 15
kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after the last each of the interrupted slots after VIL1 and VIL2.

\- when *mgta* is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15 kHz, in
the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier
with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after
the slot partially overlapped with each of the interrupted slots after
VIL1 and VIL2.

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

NOTE: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

The interruptions of NCSG in number of slots are listed in table 9.1.9-1
on all serving cells when per-UE NCSG is configured with pattern \#0-11
or on FR1 serving cells when per-FR FR1 NCSG is configured to
*ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17* capable UE. The interruptions of NCSG in number
of slots are listed in table 9.1.9-2 on all serving cells when per-UE
NCSG is configured with pattern \#12-23 or on FR2 serving cells when
per-FR FR2 NCSG is configured to *ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17* capable UE.
There are two interruptions in each NCSG occasion, VIL1 before ML and
VIL2 after ML, in NR standalone (with single carrier or NR CA). Each of
them has number of interrupted slots captured in table 9.1.9-1 and table
9.1.9-2.

#### 9.1.9.2 Requirements applicability

Requirements in clause 9.1.9 apply for UE capable of NCSG in standalone
NR in both FR1 and FR2 (including FR1+FR2 CA), provided UE is configured
with only NCSG and no other measurement gap is configured, and UE is
configured with

SSB based intra-frequency measurement (including measurement on
de-activated SCC and measurement on dormant SCell), and/or

SSB based inter-frequency measurement, and/or

Inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurement.

Requirements for the following measurements do not apply if UE is
configured with NCSG.

CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement when overlapped with NCSG, or

CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement, or

Inter-RAT GSM measurement, ***or***

Inter-RAT UTRAN measurement, ***or***

***PRS measurement.***

9.1.9.3 Requirements

The UE shall support NCSG patterns defined in table 9.1.9.3-1 that are
relevant to the UE's measurement capabilities. ML is the measurement
length. During the VIL1 and VIL2, the UE is not expected to transmit and
receive any data. Where, VIL1 is the visible interruption length before
the ML and VIL2 is the visible interruption length after the ML. During
ML, whether the UE shall transmit and receive data on the corresponding
serving carrier(s) depends on the scheduling restriction requirements
specified in clauses 9.2.7.3, 9.3.10.3, 9.4.2.5 and 9.4.3.5. The NCSG
parameters VIL1, ML, VIL2 and VIRP are illustrated in figure 9.1.9.3-1.
The applicability of the NCSG patterns in table 9.1.9.3-1 is specified
in table 9.1.9.3-2.

### 9.1.10 MUSIM gaps

If the UE requires gap patterns for MUSIM purpose, such as cell
identification and measurement, paging monitoring, SIB acquisition,
and/or on-demand SI request of the target cell in the target network,
then the network may provide one or more per-UE MUSIM gap pattern(s) for
concurrent monitoring of all frequency layers for MUSIM via
*MUSIM-GapConfig* \[2\]. The UE can be configured with no more than
three periodic MUSIM gap patterns and/or one aperiodic MUSIM gap pattern
for MUSIM via *MUSIM-GapConfig* \[2\]. The MUSIM gap patterns specified
in table 9.1.10-1 are applicable only for MUSIM operation. The MUSIM
requirements apply for the configured MUSIM gap pattern(s) requested by
UE, provided UE is allocated one or more of the requested MUSIM gaps.

The UE is not required to perform cell identification and measurement,
paging monitoring, SIB acquisition, and/or on-demand SI request of the
target cell in the target network that is outside the MUSIM gaps.

The UE is not required to conduct reception or transmission from or to
the network during MUSIM gaps that are not dropped due to collisions, as
defined in clauses 9.1.10.4 and 9.1.10.5.

The UE supporting MUSIM capability shall support the MUSIM gap patterns
listed in table 9.1.10-1 based on UE's capability specified in TS
38.306\[14\] and the applicability specified in table 9.1.10-2.

The UE determines MUSIM gap timing based on MUSIM gap offset
configuration from serving cell provided by higher layer signalling as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

#### 9.1.10.1 Introduction

This clause contains the requirements on the UE supporting MUSIM
capability, requirements in this clause are applicable for UE in NR SA
(including CA) operation mode.

#### 9.1.10.2 Priorities for MUSIM gaps

Priorities are applied for each periodic MUSIM gap. A UE shall request
priorities for all requested periodic MUSIM gaps when the UE requests
MUSIM gaps \[2\]. The UE shall request different priorities for each
periodic MUSIM gap. Priorities of the configured MUSIM gaps will be
configured. Theconfigured priorities may differ from the priorities
requested by the UE. The MUSIM requirements apply if the configured
MUSIM gap priorities retain the same relative priorities among MUSIM
gaps as requested by the UE.

The requirements in clause 9.1.10 apply provided different priorities
are allocated to each periodic MUSIM gap and each measurement gap which
is configured via *GapConfig-r17* without *preConfigInd-r17* or
*ncsgInd-r17*.

An aperiodic MUSIM gap, when configured, is unconditionally kept in case
of collisions with any other gap occasions, including MUSIM gaps and
measurement gaps.

#### 9.1.10.3 Keep solution for MUSIM gaps

The UE can request to keep all ***collided gaps for requested MUSIM
gap(s)*** via *musim-GapKeepPreference* in 38.211 \[2\]. If the UE's
request is granted, the UE shall keep all collided periodic and
aperiodic MUSIM gaps irrespectively of the configured priorities of the
periodic MUSIM gaps.

#### 9.1.10.4 Collisions between different MUSIM gaps

MUSIM gap occasions are considered colliding if at least one of the
following conditions is met:

\- the MUSIM gap occasions are fully overlapping in time domain, or

\- the MUSIM gap occasions are partially overlapping in time domain, or

\- the distance between the two MUSIM gap occasions is equal to or
smaller than 4 ms.

The distance between two MUSIM gap occasions is defined as the time
difference between the ending point of the first MUSIM gap occasion and
the starting point of the second MUSIM gap occasion, where the first
MUSIM gap occasion occurs earlier in time than the second MUSIM gap
occasion.

When "keep solution" in clause 9.1.10.3 is not configured:

\- the periodic MUSIM gap occasion colliding with an aperiodic MUSIM gap
are dropped, and

\- collisions between periodic MUSIM gap occasions are resolved based on
the assigned MUSIM gap priorities. Collisions are resolved sequentially
in order of decreasing priority, starting with the gap that has the
highest priority. For each collision, the occasion of the MUSIM gap with
higher priority shall be kept and the occasion of the MUSIM gap with
lower priority shall be dropped.

#### 9.1.10.5 Collisions between MUSIM gaps and measurement gaps

MUSIM gap and measurement gap occasions are considered colliding if at
least one of the following conditions is met:

\- the MUSIM gap and measurement gap occasions are fully overlapping in
time domain, or

\- the MUSIM gap and measurement gap occasions are partially overlapping
in time domain, or

\- the distance between any of the MUSM gap and the measurement gap
occasion is equal to or smaller than 4 ms.

The distance between two gap occasions is defined as the time difference
between the ending point of the first occasion and the starting point of
the second occasion, where the first gap occasion occurs earlier in time
than the second gap occasion. The gap occasion can be either a MUSIM gap
occasion or a measurement gap occasion.

The measurement gap occasion colliding with an aperiodic MUSIM gap shall
be dropped.

Collisions between MUSIM gaps and measurement gaps configured via
*GapConfig-r17* with assigned priority but without *preConfigInd-r17* or
*ncsgInd-r17* are resolved based on their assigned priorities:

\- If 'keep solution' in clause 9.1.10.3 is not configured, collisions
are resolved sequentially in order of decreasing priority, starting with
the gap that has the highest priority. For each collision, the occasion
of the MUSIM gap or measurement gap with higher priority shall be kept
and the occasion of the MUSIM gap or measurement gap with lower priority
shall be dropped. Any collisions between MUSIM gaps shall be addressed
as specified in clauses 9.1.10.3 and 9.1.10.4.

\- Otherwise if 'keep solution' in clause 9.1.10.3 is configured, keep
solution is used for the remaining collided and non-dropped MUSIM gaps,
after resolving the collisions between measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps
based on their priorities.

Collisions between MUSIM gaps and measurement gaps configured via
*GapConfig* or configured via *GapConfig-r17* without assigned priority
are handled based on MGRP of the colliding gaps:

\- If 'keep solution' in clause 9.1.10.3 is not configured, collisions
are resolved sequentially in order of decreasing MGRP, starting with the
gap that has the longest MGRP. For each collision, the occasion of the
MUSIM gap or measurement gap with longer MGRP shall be kept and the
occasion of the MUSIM gap or measurement gap with shorter MGRP shall be
dropped. If the colliding MUSIM gap and measurement gap have the same
MGRP, the requirements in clause 9 shall not apply to these gaps. Any
collisions between MUSIM gaps shall be addressed as specified in clauses
9.1.10.3 and 9.1.10.4.

\- Otherwise if 'keep solution' in clause 9.1.10.3 is configured, keep
solution is used for the remaining collided and non-dropped MUSIM gaps,
after resolving the collisions between measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps
based on their MGRP following the above mentioned collision rule.

#### 9.1.10.6 MUSIM gap related requirements 

A slot is interrupted by a MUSIM gap if it overlaps with any occasion of
the configured MUSIM gap, except for a dropped MUSIM gap occasion.

### 9.1.11 UL gap for Tx power management

The UL gap patterns for TX power management are listed in table 9.1.11-1
if UE supports the UL gap for Tx power management, and the UE shall
support at least one of UL MGP\#1 and UL MGP\#3. All other UL MGPs are
optional.

+------------+---------------------------+---------------------------+

An uplink gap consists of consecutive static UL slot(s) in one or more
*TDD-UL-DL-Pattern* duration, starting from the first static UL slot of
an UL gap repetition period. UGL is the aggregated length of consecutive
UL slots used as the UL gap within an UL gap repetition period. That
means, there can be a DL slot and/or special slot but no static UL slot
between the two consecutive static UL slots within the UL gap length.

When an UL gap overlaps with an uplink transmission in NR serving cells
in FR2 single CC or FR2 intra-band CA or FR2 inter-band CA where UE does
not support tx-Support-UL-GapFR2-r17, then the UE is not required to
conduct any transmission during the UL gap on the NR serving cells other
than those listed in clause 5.30 in TS 38.321 \[7\].

### 9.1.12 Concurrent measurement gaps with Pre-MG

#### 9.1.12.1 Introduction

When the UE supports *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* capability, network
can provide multiple measurement gap patterns with at least one of the
measurement gaps is pre-configured measurement gap (Pre-MG) pattern
configured by RRC message(s) as specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].
Requirements in this clause apply when the UE is in SA operation mode.

#### 9.1.12.2 Requirements

If the UE requires measurement gaps and/or Pre-MGs to identify and
measure intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or
inter-RAT E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* but does not support independent
measurement gap patterns for different frequency ranges as specified in
table 5.1-1 in \[18, 19, 20\], in order for the requirements in the
following clauses to apply, the network can provide the UE with no more
than two per-UE measurement gap patterns for monitoring all the
frequency layers.

If the UE supports both *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and independent
measurement gap patterns for different frequency ranges as specified in
table 5.1-1 in \[18, 19, 20\], in order for the requirements defined for
concurrent measurement gaps with Pre-MG to apply, the network can
provide the measurement gap pattern combinations specified in table
9.1.12.1 for monitoring of all frequency layers.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

When the UE supports *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18*, the gap association
for a frequency layer is configured by the network via
*associatedMeasGapSSB-r17 or associatedMeasGapCSIRS-r17* in the
corresponding MO(s) *or via gapAssociationPRS-r17* in *GapConfig-r17*.
In this case the gap association rules in clause 9.1.8.2 shall also
apply to either measurement gap or Pre-MG.

When autonomous mechanism \[2\] is used for activation/deactivation of
Pre-MG pattern, the UE shall autonomously determine the Pre-MG status
only based on the measurement objects associated with the concerned
Pre-MG. The related Pre-MG autonomous activation/deactivation mechanism
is specified in clause 9.1.7.3.1.

When network-controlled mechanism \[2\] is used for
activation/deactivation, the requirements specified in clause 9.1.7.3.2
apply.

When UE supports *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18*, where at least one of
the concurrent gaps is Pre-MG, applicable measurement gap patterns are
listed in table 9.1.2-1, and their applicability based on measurement
and serving cell configurations is specified in table 9.1.2-3.

The requirements in clause 9.1.2 are applicable for the UE, capable of
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and configured with multiple concurrent
measurement gap patterns, within each activated Pre-MG occasion.

#### 9.1.12.3 Collisions involving Pre-MG(s)

**A collision between occasions of two measurement gaps where the higher
priority gap is a Pre-MG and the lower priority gap may or may not be a
Pre-MG is called as dynamic collision.**

For a UE that supports *dynamicCollision-r18*:

\- Collisions between a Pre-MG and a measurement gap may occur only when
the Pre-MG is activated.

\- Collisions between two Pre-MGs may occur only when both Pre-MGs are
activated.

When the collision between a Pre-MG and a measurement gap or two Pre-MGs
satisfy the collision rule defined in clause 9.1.8.3, the UE shall
perform measurements in the occasion of the non-dropped gap except the
scenario specified in clause 9.1.12.5.

For a UE that does not support *dynamicCollision-r18*:

\- Collisions between a Pre-MG and a measurement gap or two Pre-MGs may
occur when the collision rule defined in clause 9.1.8.3 is satisfied,
regardless of the Pre-MG activation status. **.**

When the collision between a Pre-MG and a measurement gap or two Pre-MGs
satisfy the collision rule defined in clause 9.1.8.3, the UE shall
perform measurements in the occasion of the non-dropped gap regardless
of whether it collides with the Pre-MG activation or deactivation
procedure.

The requirements for the UE capable of *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18*
apply provided that the two measurement gaps colliding with each other
are configured with different priorities.

No collisions can occur between a per-FR Pre-MG and a per-FR measurement
gap when they are configured in different FRs.

No collisions can occur between per-FR Pre-MGs when they are configured
in different FRs.

#### 9.1.12.4 Collision between Pre-MG activation/deactivation and measurement gap

The requirements in this clause apply for UE that supports
*dynamicCollision-r18*.

A measurement gap occasion and a Pre-MG activation/deactivation
procedure collide when the ending point of the Pre-MG
activation/deactivation procedure occurs anywhere within a time period
starting 4 ms before the starting point of the gap occasion and ending 4
ms after the ending point of the gap occasion. The ending point of the
Pre-MG activation/deactivation procedure in this collision case is
defined in clause 8.19.2, 8.19.3 and 8.19.4.

\- When a collision occurs between a measurement gap occasion and a
Pre-MG activation procedure, and the Pre-MG is configured with higher
priority, the UE shall perform measurements during the measurement gap
occasion and the activation of the Pre-MG is delayed until 5 ms after
the ending point of the measurement gap occasion.

\- When a collision occurs between a measurement gap occasion and a
Pre-MG deactivation procedure, and the Pre-MG is configured with higher
priority, the measurement gap occasion shall be dropped.

#### 9.1.12.5 Pre-MG related requirements

A slot is interrupted by a Pre-MG if it overlaps with any occasion of
the configured Pre-MG, if the Pre-MG is activated and the Pre-MG
occasion is not dropped.

### 9.1.13 Concurrent measurement gaps with NCSG

#### 9.1.13.1 Introduction

When UE supports *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* capability, network can
provide multiple measurement gaps with at least one of the measurement
gaps is NCSG configured by RRC message(s) as specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

Requirements in this clause apply when the UE is in SA operation mode.

#### 9.1.13.2 Requirements

If the UE requires concurrent measurement gaps and/or NCSG to identify
and measure intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or
inter-RAT E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* but does not support *independentGapConfig*
or *ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17* as specified in \[14\], in order for the
requirements in the following clauses to apply, the network can provide
one per-UE concurrent measurement gap and one per-UE NCSG or at most two
per-UE NCSGs for monitoring of all frequency layers.

If the UE requires concurrent measurement gaps and/or NCSG to identify
and measure intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or
inter-RAT E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18,* *independentGapConfig* and
*ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17* as specified in \[14\], in order for the
requirements defined for concurrent measurement gaps with NCSG to apply,
the network can provide the concurrent measurement gap with NCSG
combinations configurations specified in table 9.1.13-1 for monitoring
of all frequency layers.

\- E-UTRAN inter-RAT RSTD measurement,

\- NR PRS-based positioning measurement,

can be only associated to one measurement gap pattern. Requirements for
UE capable of *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* apply provided that each
frequency layer is only associated with one concurrent measurement gap
or one NCSG, and at least one of the gaps is NCSG. There can be one or
more frequency layers associated with each concurrent measurement gap or
each NCSG. Furthermore, if the UE is not capable of
*concurrentMeasGapEUTRA-r17*\[2\], all E-UTRAN measurement objects shall
be associated with a single concurrent measurement gap or NCSG for the
requirement to apply.

When UE supports *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18*, where at least one of the
concurrent gaps is NCSG, supported concurrent measurement gap patterns
are listed in table 9.1.2-1 based on the applicability specified in
table 9.1.2-3, while supported NCSG patterns are listed in table
9.1.9.3-1 based on the applicability specified in table 9.1.9.3-2.

The requirements in clause 9.1.2 are also applicable for the UE capable
of *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and configured with multiple measurement
gap or NCSG patterns within each concurrent measurement gap pattern. The
requirements in clause 9.1.9 are also applicable for the UE capable of
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and configured with multiple measurement
gap or NCSG patterns within each NCSG pattern.

When the measurement of the measurement object *is related to a
deactivated SCell, and*

\- when NW configures the concurrent measurement gap and NCSG, UE shall
perform the measurement of this measurement object within the NCSG if
the SMTC of the measurement object is partially or fully overlapped with
the NCSG regardless of the gap assoicaition.

\- when NW configures two NCSGs, UE shall perform the measurement of
this measurement object based on the configured gap association if the
SMTC of the measurement object is partially or fully overlapped with the
NCSG. If the association is not provided, UE is not expected to cause
interruption outside the VIL due to measurement on any of the
deactivated SCells, and the existing measurement delay requirement does
not apply to this case if the SMTC of the measurement object is
partially or fully overlapped with any of the NCSGs.

#### 9.1.13.3 Collision involving NCSGs

Collisions between occasions of concurrent measurement gap and NCSG or
of two NCSGs may occur as specified in this clause if the two occasions
are

\- two per-UE NCSGs, or

\- two per-FR NCSGs in the same FR, or

\- one per-UE NCSG and one per-UE measurement gap, or

\- one per-FR NCSG and one per-UE measurement gap, or

\- one per-UE NCSG and one per-FR measurement gap, or

\- one per-FR NCSG and one per-FR measurement gap in the same FR.

and if the gap collision condition specified in clause 9.1.8.3 is met
then the gap collision rule applies.

When the first occasion is NCSG, the ending point of the first occasion
is the end of VIL2 and/or when the second occasion is NCSG, the starting
point of the second occasion is the start of VIL1.The requirements with
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* apply provided that two gaps (at least one
of the gaps is NCSG) colliding with each other are configured with
different priorities.

9.1A General measurement requirement for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------

### 9.1A.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the RedCap UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements are
split in intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD,
inter-RAT E-UTRAN TDD, and L1-RSRP measurements requirements. These
measurements may be used by the NG-RAN. The measurement quantities are
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], the measurement model is defined in TS
38.300 \[10\], TS 37.340 \[17\] and measurement accuracies are specified
in clause 10. Control of measurement reporting is specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

The SSB and SMTC in this clause apply for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if it
is not additional specified.

### 9.1A.2 Measurement gap

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE does not support independent measurement gap
patterns for different frequency ranges as specified in table 5.1-1 in
\[18, 19, 20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses
to apply the network must provide a single per-UE measurement gap
pattern for concurrent monitoring of all frequency layers.

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN cells, and the UE supports independent measurement gap patterns
for different frequency ranges as specified in table 5.1-1 in \[18, 19,
20\], in order for the requirements in the following clauses to apply
the network must provide either per-FR measurement gap patterns for
frequency range where UE requires per-FR measurement gap for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of each frequency range
independently, or a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent
monitoring of all frequency layers of all frequency ranges.

If the UE is configured via LPP \[34\] to measure PRS for any RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement and PRS-RSRPP measurement
with or without FH defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], in order for the
requirements in clauses 9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4 and 9.9A.5 to apply, the
network must provide:

\- a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent monitoring of
all positioning frequency layers and intra-frequency, inter-frequency
and/or inter-RAT frequency layers of all frequency ranges, or

\- if UE supports independent measurement gap patterns for different
frequency ranges for PRS measurement, i.e. supporting
*independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, per-FR measurement gap pattern for the
frequency range for concurrent monitoring of all positioning frequency
layers and intra-frequency, inter-frequency cells and/or inter-RAT
frequency layers in the corresponding frequency range.

During the per-UE or per-FR measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the
corresponding NR serving cell for SA (with single carrier) except the
reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s), and the signals used
for random access procedure according to \[7\].

UEs shall support the measurement gap patterns listed in table 9.1A.2-1
based on the applicability specified in table 9.1A.2-2. UE determines
measurement gap timing based on gap offset configuration and measurement
gap timing advance configuration provided by higher layer signalling as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] and TS 36.331 \[16\].

If measurement gap is configured in one FR but measurement object is not
configured in the FR, the scheduling opportunity in the FR depends on
the configured measurement gap pattern.

For NR standalone operation (with single carrier), if UE is not capable
of per-FR-gap, total interruption time on a serving cell during MGL is
defined when MGL(N) = 6 ms, 5.5 ms, 4 ms, 3.5 ms, 3 ms, and 1.5 ms. And
if UE is capable of per-FR-gap, total interruption time on FR1 serving
cell during MGL is defined only when MGL(N) = 6 ms, 4 ms, and 3 ms, and
total interruption time on FR2 serving cell during MGL is defined only
when MGL(N) = 5.5 ms, 3.5 ms, and 1.5 ms.

\(a\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0 ms
for serving cell in synchronous NR standalone operation (with single
carrier)

\(b\) Measurement gap with MGL = N(ms) with MG timing advance of 0.5 ms
for serving cell in synchronous NR standalone operation (with single
carrier)

Figure 9.1A.2-1: Measurement GAP and total interruption time on serving
cell for NR standalone operation (with single carrier)

The corresponding total number of interrupted slots on serving cell is
listed in table 9.1A.2-3 for serving cell in NR standalone (with single
carrier).

It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to conduct
transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when MGTA is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect
to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots
occurring immediately after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than 15
kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15 kHz, in the
L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with
the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after the
slot partially overlapped with measurement gap

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

#### 9.1A.2.1 SA: Measurement Gap Sharing

For NR standalone UE configured with per-UE measurement gap, measurement
gap sharing shall be applies when UE requires measurement gaps to
identify and measure cells on an intra-frequency carrier or when SMTC
configured for intra-frequency measurement are fully overlapping with
per-UE measurement gaps, and when UE requires measurement gaps to
identify and measure cells on inter-frequency carriers for SSB based L3
measurement, or when all of SMTC configured for inter-frequency SSB
based measurement without measurement gaps are fully overlapping with
per-UE measurement gaps or per-FR measurement gap, and/or inter-RAT
E-UTRAN carriers.

For NR standalone UE configured with per-FR1 measurement gap,
measurement gap sharing shall be applied when UE requires measurement
gaps to identify and measure cells on FR1 intra-frequency carriers or
when SMTC configured for FR1 intra-frequency measurement are fully
overlapping with per-FR1 measurement gaps, and when UE requires
measurement gaps to identify and measure cells on FR1 inter-frequency
carriers for SSB based L3 measurement and/or inter-RAT E-UTRAN carriers,
or when all of SMTC configured for inter-frequency SSB based measurement
without measurement gaps are fully overlapping with per-FR1 measurement
gaps.

For NR standalone UE configured with per-FR2 measurement gap,
measurement gap sharing shall be applied when UE requires measurement
gaps to identify and measure cells on FR2 intra-frequency carriers or
when SMTC configured for FR2 intra-frequency measurement are fully
overlapping with per-FR2 measurement gaps, and when UE requires
measurement gaps to identify and measure cells on FR2 inter-frequency
carriers for SSB based L3 measurement, or when all of SMTC configured
for inter-frequency SSB based measurement without measurement gaps are
fully overlapping with per-UE measurement gaps.

When network signals "01", "10" or "11" with RRC parameter
*MeasGapSharingScheme* \[2\] and the value of X is defined as in table
9.1.2.1a-1, and

\- K~intra~ = 1 / X \* 100,

### 9.1A.3 UE Measurement capability

#### 9.1A.3.1 SA: Monitoring of multiple layers using gaps

The requirements in this clause are applicable for UE configured with SA
NR operation mode.

When monitoring of multiple inter-RAT E-UTRAN carriers and
inter-frequency NR carriers with gaps(or without using gaps provided the
UE supports such capability or the effective MGRP is applied for per-FR
measurement gap capable UE) is configured by PCell, the UE shall be
capable of performing one measurement of the configured measurement type
(SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, SS-SINR, E-UTRAN RSRP, E-UTRAN RSRQ, E-UTRAN RS-SINR
measurements, etc.) of detected cells on all the layers.

For UE configured with the NR SA operation, the effective total number
of frequencies, excluding the frequencies of the PCell being monitored,
is N~freq,\ SA,\ RedCap~, which is defined as:

N~freq,\ SA,\ RedCap~ = N~freq,\ SA,\ NR,\ RedCap~ +
N~freq,\ SA,\ E-UTRA,\ RedCap~ ,

where

N~freq,\ SA,\ E-UTRA,\ RedCap~ is the number of E-UTRA inter-RAT
carriers being monitored (FDD and TDD) as configured by PCell,

N~freq,\ SA,\ NR,\ RedCap~ is the number of NR inter-frequency carriers
being monitored as configured by PCell.

#### 9.1A.3.2 SA: Maximum allowed layers for multiple monitoring

If a UE is configured with SA NR operation mode, the UE shall be capable
of monitoring at least:

\- Depending on UE capability, 6 NR SSB inter-frequency carriers
configured by PCell, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 6 E-UTRA TDD inter-RAT carriers
configured by PCell, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 6 E-UTRA FDD inter-RAT carriers
configured by PCell.

*In addition to the requirements defined above,* the UE shall be capable
of monitoring a total of at least \[10\] effective carrier frequency
layers comprising of any above defined combination of NR, E-UTRA FDD,
and E-UTRA TDD layers.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

### 9.1A.4 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria

#### 9.1A.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in
clause 9.1A.4.2, the UE shall meet all other performance requirements
defined in clause 9 and clause 10.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Each measurement identity
corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic reporting, or no
reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each measurement identity
is associated with an event triggering criterion. In case of periodic
reporting, a measurement identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.

#### 9.1A.4.2 Requirements

In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in
the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion
(in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case
of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of event,
with the same or different event identities, is counted as separate
reporting criterion in table 9.1A.4.2-1.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to table \[9.1A.4.2-1\]. For the
measurement categories belonging to intra-frequency, inter-frequency,
and inter-RAT measurements (i.e. without counting other categories that
the UE shall always support in parallel), the UE need not support more
than the total number of reporting criteria as follows:

\- For UE configured with SA operation mode: , where

is the total number of NR reporting criteria according to table
9.1A.4.2-1,

is the total number of inter-RAT E-UTRA reporting criteria according to
table 9.1A.4.2-1.

Table 9.1A.4.2-1: Requirements for reporting criteria per measurement
category

  ----------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Measurement category                                              E~cat~   Note
  Intra-frequency ^Note\ 1^                                         9        Events for any one or a combination of intra-frequency SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR for NG-RAN intra-frequency cells
  Inter-frequency ^Note\ 1^                                         10       Events for any one or a combination of inter-frequency SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINRfor NG-RAN inter-frequency cells

### 9.1A.5 Carrier-specific scaling factor

This clause specifies the derivation of carrier-specific scaling factor
(CSSF) values, which scales the measurement delay requirements given in
clauses 9.2B, 9.3Band 9.4A when UE is configured to monitor multiple
measurement objects. The CSSF values are categorized into
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ and CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~, for the
measurements conducted outside measurement gaps and within measurement
gaps, respectively.

#### 9.1A.5.1 Monitoring of multiple layers outside gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ for
measurement object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types:*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2B.5, when none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2B.5, when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3B.7, when none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap, if UE supports
*interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause \[9.3B.7\], when part of the SMTC occasions of this
inter-frequency measurement object are overlapped by the measurement
gap, if UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object *i*
only outside the measurement gaps.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps,
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ and requirements derived from
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ are not specified.

##### 9.1A.5.1.1 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based measurements performed outside gaps

For UE in SA operation mode, the carrier-specific scaling factor
CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ for intra-frequency SSB-based measurements,
inter-frequency SSB-based measurements performed outside measurements
gaps, will be specified as follows:

CSSF~outside\_gap\ RedCap,i~ =1, if only one measurement object is
configured to be measured outside of MG for RedCap.

CSSF~outside\_gap\ RedCap,i~ =2 for intra-frequency measurement, and
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ = 2\*Y for inter-frequency measurement with no
measurement gap, Y is the number of configured inter-frequency MOs
without MG that are being measured outside of MG.

If intra-frequency measurement is with measurement gap,
CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ = Y for inter-frequency measurement with no
measurement gap, Y is the number of configured inter-frequency MOs
without MG that are being measured outside of MG.

#### 9.1A.5.2 Monitoring of multiple layers within gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ for a
measurement object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types:*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with no measurement gap
in clause 9.2B.5, when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.2B.6.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.3B.4.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap
for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap* in clause 9.3B.7, when

\- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap, or

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap but the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is not configured by the Network

\- E-UTRA Inter-RAT measurement object in clauses 9.4A.2 and 9.4A.3.

\- NR PRS-based measurements for positioning in clause 9.9A.

UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object *i*
only within the measurement gaps.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~
and requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ are not
specified.

##### 9.1A.5.2.1 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ and
is derived as described in this clause.

If measurement object *i* refers to a long-periodicity measurement which
is any of:

\- an NR measurement for positioning frequency layer *i* with
T~available\_PRS,i~ \>160 ms, where T~available\_PRS,i~ is defined in
clauses 9.9A.2.5.1, 9.9A.3.5.1, 9.9A.4.5 and 9.9A.5.5 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP
,UE Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements without frequency
hopping, respectively.

\- an NR measurement for positioning frequency layer *i* with
T~available\_PRS,i~ \>160 ms, where T~available\_PRS,i~ is defined in
clauses 9.9A.2.6.1, 9.9A.3.6.1, 9.9A.4.8 and 9.9A.5.8 for RSTD, PRS-RSRP
,UE Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurements with frequency
hopping, respectively.

then CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ =1. Otherwise, the
CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ for other measurement objects participate in
the gap competition and the CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ are derived as
below.

When multiple positioning frequency layers are configured,

\- for each positioning frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~
is derived with the following steps assuming no other positioning
frequency layer is configured.

\- for each RRM frequency layer *i*, CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is
derived as follows:

\- an intermediate CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i,k~ is derived with the
following steps assuming only positioning frequency layer *k* is
configured, and

\- CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~= max(CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i,k~),
where *k*=0...K-1, and K is the number of configured positioning
frequency layers.

For each measurement gap *j* not used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, count the total number of intra-frequency measurement
objects, inter-frequency/inter-RAT measurement objects and NR
positioning frequency layers which are candidates to be measured within
the gap *j*.

For each measurement gap *j* used for a long-periodicity measurement
defined above, M~intra\_RedCap,i,j~ = M~inter\_RedCap,i,j~ =
M~tot\_RedCap,i,j~ =0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is given

### 9.1A.6 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within gaps or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

The carrier-specific scaling factor specified in clause 9.1A.5 that
applies to the other impacted measurement objects will also apply based
on the longer measurement or cell identification delay before or after
the transition.

When the UE transitions between DRX and non-DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements apply based on the longer delay before or after the
transition.

When the intra-frequency measurement transitions from measurements
performed on CD-SSB to measurements performed on NCD-SSB or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one cell identification period, the UE shall
use a cell identification period that is the maximum of the cell
identification periods corresponding to the first SSB type and the
second SSB type after the BWP switching.

When the intra-frequency measurement transitions from measurements
performed on CD-SSB to measurements performed on NCD-SSB or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one measurement period, the UE shall use a
measurement period that is the maximum of the measurement periods
corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after the
BWP switching.

When the measurement on one measurement object transitions from
inter-frequency measurement to intra-frequency measurement or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one cell identification period, the UE shall
use a cell identification period that is the maximum of the cell
identification periods corresponding to the first SSB type and the
second SSB type after the BWP switching.

When the measurement on one measurement object transitions from
inter-frequency measurement to intra-frequency measurement or vice versa
due to BWP switching during one measurement period, the UE shall use a
measurement period that is the maximum of the measurement periods
corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after the
BWP switching.

Subsequent to the above-mentioned measurement periods and/or cell
identification periods, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements on each measurement object are based on the SSB type after
the BWP switch.

9.1C General measurement requirement for SAN
--------------------------------------------

### 9.1C.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements are
split in intra-frequency, inter-frequency and L1-RSRP measurements
requirements. These measurements may be used by the NG-RAN. The
measurement quantities are defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], the measurement
model is defined in TS 38.300 \[10\], TS 37.340 \[17\] and measurement
accuracies are specified in clause 10. Control of measurement reporting
is specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.1C.2 Measurement gap

For the UE configured with only PCell, which is served by SAN, if the UE
requires measurement gaps to identify and measure cells operating in
satellite access network and/or TN cells, in order for the requirements
in the following clauses to apply the network must provide at least one
per-UE measurement gap and the number of per-UE measurement gaps
provided by the network must not exceed the number of measurement gaps
supported by the UE, indicated by the capability
*parallelMeasurementGap*.

If the UE is configured via LPP \[34\] to measure PRS for UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], in order for the
requirements in clauses 9.9C.4 to apply, the network must provide at
least one per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent monitoring of
all positioning frequency layers and intra-frequency and/or
inter-frequency layers. The number of per-UE measurement gaps provided
by the network must not exceed the number of measurement gaps supported
by the UE, indicated by the capability *parallelMeasurementGap*.

During the per-UE measurement gaps the UE:

\- is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to the PCell
except the reception of signals used for RRM measurement(s) and the
signals used for random access procedure according to \[7\].

UEs shall support the measurement gap patterns listed in table 9.1C.2-1
based on the the applicability specified in table 9.1C.2-3. UE
determines measurement gap timing based on gap offset configuration and
measurement gap timing advance configuration provided by higher layer
signalling as specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] and TS 36.331 \[16\].

In determining the measurement gap starting point, UE shall use the DL
timing of the latest NR subframe occurring immediately before the
configured measurement gap. If per-UE measurement gap is configured with
MG timing advance of T~MG~ ms, the measurement gap starts at time T~MG~
ms advanced to the end of the latest subframe occurring immediately
before the configured measurement gap. T~MG~ is the MG timing advance
value provided in *mgta* according to \[2\].

+----------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+

UL slots that are fully or partially overlapping with measurement gap,
taking into account TA as defined in clause 7.1C.2, are interrupted.

NOTE: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

### 9.1C.8 Concurrent measurement gaps for SAN

#### 9.1C.8.1 Introduction

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap pattern capability, network
can provide multiple measurement gaps configured by RRC message(s) as
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

#### 9.1C.8.2 Requirements

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells, and the UE supports
concurrent measurement gap patterns (*parallelMeasurementGap*), in order
for the requirements in the following clauses to apply the network can
provide at most two per-UE measurement gap patterns for monitoring of
all frequency layers.

For UE configured with the SA operation, when monitoring of multiple
intra-frequency and inter-frequency NR carrier frequency layers as
configured by PCell using gaps, each monitored carrier frequency layer,
including *following measurement types:*

> \- a measurement object with SSB based measurement,

can be associated to one or two measurement gap pattern(s) provided the
network configures the concurrent measurement gap patterns.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns, each measurement
gap pattern supported by the UE is listed in table 9.1C.2-1.

The requirements in clause 9.1C.2 are also applicable for the UE capable
of and configured with multiple concurrent measurement gap patterns
within each measurement gap pattern.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gap patterns and configured with
more than 1 per-UE measurement gap patterns, requirements do not apply
if the UE is configured with more than one measurement gap pattern (MGP)
with measurement gap repetition period (MGRP) of 20 ms.

#### 9.1C.8.3 Collision between concurrent measurement gaps

Collisions between occasions of two concurrent measurement gaps may
occur as specified in this clause if the two measurement gaps are

\- two per-UE measurement gaps.

When UE is configured with concurrent measurement gaps, two measurement
gap occasions are considered colliding if at least one of the following
conditions is met:

\- the two occasions are fully or partially overlapping in time domain,
or

\- the distance between the two occasions is equal to or smaller than 4
ms.

The distance between two measurement gap occasions is defined as the
time difference between the ending point of the first occasion and the
starting point of the second occasion, where the first measurement gap
occasion occurs earlier in time than the second measurement gap
occasion.

If two colliding measurement gaps are not fully overlapping, in case of
collision between two measurement gap occasions, the UE shall perform
measurements in the occasion of the measurement gap with higher
priority, and the occasion of the measurement gap with lower priority
shall be dropped. The UE shall be able to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or
receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI in the corresponding NR serving
cells in the slots that are not interrupted according to requirements in
clause 9.1C.8.4.

If two colliding measurement gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP=160
ms, in case of collision between two measurement gap occasions, the UE
shall perform measurements in the occasion of one of the measurement
gaps, and it is up to UE implementation which occasion is used for
measurement, provided that UE can meet the requirements in clause 9.2C
and 9.3C.

If two measurement gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP\<160 ms, no
measurement requirements apply.

#### 9.1C.8.4 Measurement gap related requirements of concurrent measurement gaps

A slot is considered as interrupted if it is interrupted by an occasion
of any of the configured concurrent measurement gaps following the
measurement gap interruption requirements in clause 9.1C.2, except for a
dropped measurement gap occasion.

### 9.1C.9 Collision between SMTC and measurement gap for SAN

#### 9.1C.9.1 Introduction

This clause contains definition of collision between SMTCs and
measurement gap for SAN.

#### 9.1C.9.2 Collision between SMTCs and measurement gap

Collision between occasions of SMTC and measurement gap may occur as
specified in this clause.

When UE is configured with one or more than one measurement gap pattern,
an SMTC occasion outside measurement gap and a measurement gap occasion
are considered colliding if at least one of the following conditions is
met:

\- the SMTC occasion is fully or partially overlapping in time domain
with the measurement gap occasion, or

\- the magnitude of the distance between the SMTC occasion and the
measurement gap occasion in time domain is less than or equals to 4 ms.

The distance between a SMTC occasion and a measurement gap occasion is
defined as:

\- the time difference between the ending point of the SMTC occasion and
the starting point of the measurement gap occasion, where the SMTC
occasion occurs earlier in time than the MG occasion, or

\- the time difference between the ending point of the measurement gap
occasion and the starting point of the SMTC occasion, where the
measurement gap occasion occurs earlier in time than the SMTC occasion.

#### 9.1C.9.3 Collision between multiple SMTCs on a SAN carrier

Collision between occasions of multiple SMTCs may occur as specified in
this clause.

When UE is configured with more than one SMTC on a SAN carrier, two SMTC
occasions outside measurement gap are considered colliding if at least
one of the following conditions is met:

> \- the two SMTC occasions are fully or partially overlapping in time
> domain, or
>
> \- the magnitude of the distance between two SMTC occasions in time
> domain is less than or equals to 4 ms.

The distance between two SMTC occasions is defined as the time
difference between the ending point of the earlier SMTC occasion and the
starting point of the later SMTC occasion.

9.1D General measurement requirement for ATG
--------------------------------------------

### 9.1D.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the ATG UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements are
split in intra-frequency, inter-frequency, and L1-RSRP measurements
requirements. These measurements may be used by the NG-RAN. The
measurement quantities are defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], the measurement
model is defined in TS 38.300 \[10\], TS 37.340 \[17\] and measurement
accuracies are specified in clause 10. Control of measurement reporting
is specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.1D.2 Measurement gap

If the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure
intra-frequency cells and/or inter-frequency cells, and the UE does not
support independent measurement gap patterns for different frequency
ranges as specified in table 5.1-1 in \[18, 19, 20\], in order for the
requirements in the following clauses to apply the network must provide
a single per-UE measurement gap pattern for concurrent monitoring of all
frequency layers.

During the per-UE measurement gaps an ATG UE, operating under SA single
carrier mode, is not required to conduct reception/transmission from/to
the corresponding NR serving cells except the reception of signals used
for RRM measurement(s).

UEs shall support the measurement gap patterns listed in table 9.1D.2-1
based on the applicability specified in table 9.1D.2-3. UE determines
measurement gap timing based on gap offset configuration and measurement
gap timing advance configuration provided by higher layer signalling as
specified in TS 38.331.

It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to conduct
transmission in the following slot(s),

\- when MGTA is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect
to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots
occurring immediately after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is other than 15
kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after measurement gap

\- when MGTA is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is 15 kHz, in the
L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with
the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately after the
slot partially overlapped with measurement gap

where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if for the UL transmission is less than the length of
one slot; L=2 otherwise.

NOTE: Network is supposed to take into account the possible difference
between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when scheduling
UE in the above slot(s).

#### 9.1D.2.1a SA: Measurement Gap Sharing

Measurement gap sharing shall be applied when UE requires measurement
gaps to identify and measure cells on intra-frequency carriers or when
SMTC configured for intra-frequency measurement are fully overlapping
with per-UE measurement gaps, and when UE requires measurement gaps to
identify and measure cells on inter-frequency carriers for both SSB and
CSI-RS based L3 measurement, or when all of SMTC configured for
inter-frequency SSB based measurement without measurement gaps are fully
overlapping with per-UE measurement gaps.

When network signals "01", "10" or "11" with RRC parameter
*MeasGapSharingScheme* \[2\] and the value of X is defined as in table
9.1D.2.1A-1, and

\- K~intra~ = 1 / X \* 100,

> \- K~inter~ = 1 / (100 -- X) \* 100,
>
> When network signals "00" indicating equal splitting gap sharing, X is

\- Depending on UE capability, 7 NR SSB inter-frequency carriers
configured by PCell, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 8 NR inter-frequency carriers including
SSB and CSI-RS in total configured by PCell.

*The number of SSB frequency layers equals to the total number of MOs
with*

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* configured, or

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* not configured *but csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility
configured with associatedSSB*.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

The number of CSI-RS frequency layers equals to the number of MOs with
*csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility* configured assuming single MO is
configured per frequency layer.

### 9.1D.4 Void

### 9.1D.5 Carrier-specific scaling factor

This clause specifies the derivation of carrier-specific scaling factor
(CSSF) values, which scales the measurement delay requirements given in
clause 9.2D, 9.3D, and CSI-RS based L3 measurement in clause 9.10D when
UE is configured to monitor multiple measurement objects. The CSSF
values are categorized into CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ and
CSSF~within\_gap,i~, for the measurements conducted outside measurement
gaps and within measurement gaps, respectively.

#### 9.1D.5.1 Monitoring of multiple layers outside gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for measurement
object *i derived in this chapter is applied to following measurement
types:*

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2D.5, when none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.2D.5, when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.10D.2, when none
of CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement in clause 9.10D.2, when all
CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this intra-frequency measurement
object are partially overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3D.9, when none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap, if UE supports
*interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap in
clause 9.3D.9, when part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap, if UE supports
*interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

The UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object
*i* only outside the measurement gaps.

The number of frequency layers for SSB measurements shall include the
total number of MOs with

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* configured, or

*- ssb-ConfigMobility* not configured *but csi-rs-ResourceConfigMobility
configured with associatedSSB*.

If *ssbfrequency, smtc1, smtc2* and *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* are same in
multiple MOs, the multiple MOs are counted as one SSB frequency layer.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

##### 9.1D.5.1.2 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB-based, CSI-RS based L3 measurements performed outside gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ for

#### 9.1D.5.2 Monitoring of multiple layers within gaps

The carrier-specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ for a
measurement object *i* derived in this chapter is applied to following
measurement types:

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with no measurement gap
in clause 9.2D.5, when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.2D.6.

\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.10D.3, when
CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this inter-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement in clause 9.10D.3, when
CSI-RS resources for L3 measurement of this inter-frequency measurement
object are partially overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap in
clause 9.3D.4.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap
for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap* in clause 9.3D.9, when

\- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap, or

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap, but the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is not configured by the Network.

The UE is expected to conduct the measurement of this measurement object
*i* only within the measurement gaps.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and
requirements derived from CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ are not specified.

Number of SSB layers shall include SSB for mobility and that as
associated SSB for CSI-RS mobility. The ssbfrequency is counted only
once if the ssbfrequency for mobility and associated SSB are the same,
or ssbfrequency and smtc in multiple MOs are the same.

SSB-based measurement and CSI-RS based measurement for mobility
configured in the same measurement object are considered as different
layers.

##### 9.1D.5.2.1 Void

##### 9.1D.5.2.2 SA mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB, CSI-RS-based L3 measurements performed within gaps

When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index *i* is designated as CSSF~within\_gap,i~ and is
derived as described in this clause.

For each measurement gap *j*, count the total number of intra-frequency
measurement objects and inter-frequency measurement objects on all
frequency layers which are candidates to be measured within the gap *j*.

\- An NR measurement object with SSB measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if its SMTC duration is fully covered
by the MGL excluding RF switching time. For intra-frequency NR
measurement objects, if the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of
*smtc2* is configured, the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; otherwise
the assumed periodicity of SMTC occasions corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

\- An NR measurement object with CSI-RS measurement configured is a
candidate to be measured in a gap if the window confining all CSI-RS
resources is fully covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time.

\- For UEs which are configured with per UE gaps the counting is done on
a per UE basis.

\- M~intra,i,j~: Number of intra-frequency measurement objects,
including both SSB and CSI-RS based, which are candidates to be measured
in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is also a candidate.
Otherwise M~intra,i,j~ equals 0.

\- M~inter,i,j~ : Number of NR inter-frequency layers including both SSB
and CSI-RS based, which are candidates to be measured in gap *j* where
the measurement object *i* is also a candidate. Otherwise M~inter,i,j~
equals 0.

\- M~tot,i,j~ = M~intra,i,j~ + M~inter,i,j~ : Total number of
intra-frequency layers, inter-frequency, which are candidates to be
measured in gap *j* where the measurement object *i* is also a
candidate. Otherwise M~tot,i,j~ equals 0.

The carrier specific scaling factor CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is given by:

If *measGapSharingScheme* is equal sharing, CSSF~within\_gap,i~=
max(ceil(R~i~×M~tot,i,j~)), where *j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

If *measGapSharingScheme* is not equal sharing and

\- measurement object *i* is an intra-frequency measurement object,
CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~intra~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~intra,i,j~) in gaps where M~inter,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- measurement object *i* is an inter-frequency measurement object on
any one frequency layer, CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the maximum among

\- ceil(R~i~×K~inter~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~ ≠0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

\- ceil(R~i~×M~inter,i,j~) in gaps where M~intra,i,j~=0, where
*j*=0...(160/MGRP)-1

Where R~i~ is the maximal ratio of the number of measurement gap where
measurement object *i* is a candidate to be measured over the number of
measurement gap where measurement object *i* is a candidate to be
measured.

### 9.1D.6 Void

### 9.1D.7 Pre-configured measurement gap

#### 9.1D.7.1 Introduction

A UE capable of Pre-configured measurement gap (Pre-MG) pattern can be
configured with a Pre-MG pattern via RRC signalling \[2\].

The gap interruption requirements in clause 9.1D.2 apply to Pre-MG when
Pre-MG is activated, and no gap interruption is expected when Pre-MG is
deactivated.

#### 9.1D.7.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements related to pre-configured measurement gap apply
provided:

\- UE indicates support of *preconfiguredUE-AutonomousMeasGap* \[2\]
and/or *preconfiguredNW-ControlledMeasGap* \[2\], and

\- a single per-UE measurement gap is pre-configured by the network, and

\- one of measurement gap patterns among measurement gap patterns \#0 \~
\#11 is configured for pre-configured measurement gap, and

\- UE is in NR SA with single carrier.

A measurement gap is configured as pre-configured measurement gap if
*preConfigInd* is indicated by network in the configuration message of
the measurement gap.

If UE indicates support of only *preconfiguredNW-ControlledMeasGap*
\[2\], UE can expect the network to configure *preConfGapStatus*.

If a measurement gap is configured as pre-configured measurement gap,
the applicability of measurement gap patterns is defined in table
9.1D.2-3.

If the Pre-MG status changes during a measurement period of a
measurement that can be performed without and within measurement gaps,
the UE is allowed to restart the measurement.

If the Pre-MG status changes from activated to deactivated during a
measurement period of a measurement that can only be performed within
measurement gaps, the measurement requirements do not apply.

#### 9.1D.7.3 Requirements

Any of the measurement Gap pattern defined in table 9.1D.2-1 can be
configured as Pre-MG pattern.

The UE can determine the Pre-MG status based on autonomous
activation/deactivation mechanism or based on network-controlled
activation/deactivation mechanism.

A UE capable of both autonomous and network-controlled mechanisms for
activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern will not use autonomous rules
to determine the activation/deactivation status of the pre-configured MG
if the network provides the activation/deactivation status via RRC
indication *preConfGapStatus* for all the DL BWPs of PCell.

##### 9.1D.7.3.1 Requirements for autonomous activation/deactivation mechanism

Requirements in this clause apply when autonomous mechanism \[2\] is
used for activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern.

The UE can autonomously change the Pre-MG status from activation to
deactivation or vice versa based on any of the following triggering
conditions listed below. The UE shall also autonomously determine the
Pre-MG status based on all the concurrent triggering conditions
occurring jointly:

\- DCI, timer or RRC based active BWP switching,

\- Addition/removal of any measurement object(s)

The UE shall autonomously determine the status of the per-UE Pre-MG
pattern as deactivated immediately after the configuration of the per-UE
Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering conditions above is
satisfied provided that all the configured measurements can be performed
without measurement gaps.

A measurement can be performed by the UE without measurement gaps if any
of the following conditions is met:

\- The UE is configured with SSB based intra-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based intra-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.2D.1 are met, or

\- The UE is configured with SSB based inter-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based inter-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.3D.1 are met, or

\- The UE is configured with CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements.

The UE shall autonomously determine the status of the per-UE Pre-MG
pattern as activated immediately after the configuration of the per-UE
Pre-MG pattern or when any of the triggering conditions above is
satisfied provided that at least one of the configured measurements
cannot be performed without measurement gaps.

A measurement cannot be performed by the UE without measurement gaps if
any of the following conditions is met:

\- The UE is configured with SSB based intra-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based intra-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.2D.1 are not met, or

\- The UE is configured with SSB based inter-frequency measurements, and
the conditions defined for SSB based inter-frequency measurement without
gaps in clause 9.3D.1 are not met, or

\- The UE is configured with CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurements.

##### 9.1D.7.3.2 Requirements for network-controlled activation/deactivation mechanism

The requirements in this clause apply when network-controlled mechanism
\[2\] is used for activation/deactivation of Pre-MG pattern.

For per-UE Pre-configured MG,

\- the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is activated if
*preConfGapStatus* is set to '1' for the corresponding gap ID for the
active DL BWP of PCell,

\- otherwise, the UE determines that the Pre-configured MG is
deactivated

##### 9.1D.7.3.3 Requirements for reception/transmission during activation/deactivation

The requirements in this clause apply when autonomous mechanism or
network-controlled mechanism is used for activation/deactivation \[2\]
of Pre-MG pattern.

If per-UE Pre-MG pattern is activated then the UE is not required to
conduct reception/transmission from/to the corresponding serving cells
during the gap occasion according to the same principles as described
for per-UE measurement gaps in clause 9.1D.2. Otherwise, the UE can be
scheduled for reception/transmission of signals in all the serving cells
during the gap occasion.

### 9.1D.8 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria

#### 9.1D.8.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in
clause 9.1D.8.2, the UE shall meet all other performance requirements
defined in clause 9 and clause 10.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]. Each measurement identity
corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic reporting, or no
reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each measurement identity
is associated with an event triggering criterion. In case of periodic
reporting, a measurement identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.

#### 9.1D.8.2 Requirements

In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event (in
the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting criterion
(in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion (in case
of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of event,
with the same or different event identities, is counted as separate
reporting criterion in table 9.1D.8.2-1.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to table 9.1D.8.2-1. For the measurement
categories belonging to intra-frequency, inter-frequency, the UE need
not support more than the total number of reporting criteria as follows:

\- For UE configured with SA operation mode: $E_{cat,SA,NR}$, where

is the total number of NR reporting criteria according to table
9.1D.8.2-1, and n is the number of configured NR serving frequencies,
including PCell carrier frequency.

Table 9.1D.8.2-1: Requirements for reporting criteria per measurement
category

  Measurement category   E~cat~   Note
  ---------------------- -------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Intra-frequency        9        Events for any one or a combination of intra-frequency SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, SS-SINR, CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR for NG-RAN intra-frequency cells
  Inter-frequency        10       Events for any one or a combination of inter-frequency SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, SS-SINR, CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR for NG-RAN inter-frequency cells
  NOTE 1: Void.                   

### 9.1D.9 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the measurement on one intra-frequency measurement object
transitions from measurements performed outside gaps to measurements
performed within gaps or vice versa during one measurement period, the
cell identification and measurement period requirements with the longer
delay apply.

The carrier-specific scaling factor specified in clause 9.1D.5 that
applies to the other impacted measurement objects will also apply based
on the longer measurement or cell identification delay before or after
the transition.

When the UE transitions between DRX and non-DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, the cell identification and measurement period
requirements apply based on the longer delay before or after the
transition.

Subsequent to this measurement period, the cell identification and
measurement period requirements on each measurement object are
corresponding to the second mode after transition.

9.2 NR intra-frequency measurements
-----------------------------------

### 9.2.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell and the
centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour cell indicated for
measurement are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are
also the same.

If the UE supports *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, a measurement is defined as a
SSB based intra-frequency measurement provided the centre frequency of
the reference SSB of the serving cell and the centre frequency of the
SSB of the neighbour cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of
the two SSBs are also the same. The reference SSB is the **SSB defined
in BWP-specific *servingCellMO* under *BWP-DownlinkDedicated* of active
DL BWP. If the field is absent,** the reference SSB is the SSB defined
in *servingCellMO* under *ServingCellConfig \[2\]***.**

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or the
PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- CD-SSB is within the configured UE-specific CBW provided UE supports
*bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, or

\- NCD-SSB is completely contained in the active downlink BWP of the UE
provided the UE supports *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18* and *servingCellMO* is
present in the corresponding *BWP-DownlinkDedicated*, or

\- the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement, or

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP \[3\].

Besides the conditions listed above,

For UE supporting *nr-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17* and indicating
*NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for intra-frequency measurement,

\- An intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement without
gap if

\- the UE indicates 'nogap-noncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
intra-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- the active downlink BWP is not an initial BWP \[3\].

\- An intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with
NCSG if

\- the UE indicates 'ncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
intra-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- the active downlink BWP is not an initial BWP \[3\]

\- An intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap
if

> \- the UE indicates 'gap' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
> intra-frequency measurement, and
>
> \- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE,
> and
>
> \- the active downlink BWP is not an initial BWP \[3\]

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurement corresponding
to a deactivated SCell or dormant SCell with NCSG.

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements with NCSG, UE may cause
scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2.7.3.

For UE supporting *nr-NeedForInterruptionReport-r18* and indicating
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for intra-frequency measurement,

\- an intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement without
gap if

\- SMTC is not partially nor fully overlapped with a configured GAP and
the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* and the UE
indicates 'no-gap-no-interruption' or 'no-gap-with-interruption' via
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for the intra-frequency measurement

\- the UE is not allowed to cause interruption during intra-frequency
measurement without gap when UE indicate no-gap-no-interruption

\- the UE is not allowed to cause interruption if the SSB is completely
contained in the active BWP of the UE

\- the UE is allowed to cause interruption during intra-frequency
measurement without gap when UE indicate no-gap-with-interruption, the
interruption requirement is defined in clause 8.2.2.2.19.

\- an intra-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap
if

\- the UE indicates 'gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for intra-frequency
measurement, or if measurement gaps configured and the SMTC is partially
or fully overlapping with the measurement gap.

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2.5.3. SSB
based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ which start earlier than the gap starting time
+ switching time, nor detect SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which end
later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching time is 0.5 ms for
frequency range FR1 and 0.25 ms for frequency range FR2.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

The measurement requirements defined for an activated SCell with a
non-dormant active BWP defined in this clause shall also apply to an
activated SCell with dormant BWP as active BWP.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

The measurement requirements defined in clause 9.2 do not apply if the
UE is configured with *needForGapNCSG-ConfigNR-r17* and
*needForInterruptionConfigNR-r18* at the same time.

*Editor Note: FFS the scenario when deactivated SCell measurement object
is fully overlapping with measurement gap*

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2.5 applies for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

> \- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the union of concurrent measurement gaps.
>
> \- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- for a UE supporting MUSIM gaps or both concurrent measurement gaps
and MUSIM gaps, and when periodic MUSIM gaps or both concurrent and
periodic MUSIM gaps are configured*:*

\- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by MUSIM gaps or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps or the union of MUSIM gaps and concurrent measurement
gaps.

> \- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by MUSIM gaps or the union of concurrent
> measurement gaps or the union of MUSIM gaps and concurrent measurement
> gaps.

\- for a UE supporting MUSIM gaps and not supporting concurrent gaps or
if concurrent gaps are not configured, and when periodic MUSIM gaps are
configured*:*

> \- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by MUSIM gaps or the measurement gap or the
> union of MUSIM gaps and measurement gap.
>
> \- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by MUSIM gaps or the measurement gap or the
> union of MUSIM gaps and measurement gap.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

> \- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap.
>
> \- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements object with no measurement gap
for UE capable of *nr-NeedForInterruptionReport-r18*,

\- When UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement and indicates '*no-gap-with-interruption'*
or '*no-gap-no-interruption'* via *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for
the intra-frequency measurement intra-frequency, and SMTC is fully non
overlapping with GAP,

\- When UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement and indicates *no-gap-no-interruption* via
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for the intra-frequency measurement, and
SMTC is partially overlapping with GAP,

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2.6 applies for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with measurement gap,

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap with
the following condition,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

> \- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap in the
> concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
> SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are
> overlapped with the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- for a UE supporting concurrent measurement gaps and when both
concurrent and periodic MUSIM gaps are configured

> \- when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap in
> concurrent measurement gaps and all the SMTC occasions of this
> intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped with the union of
> concurrent measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps. No requirement applies if
> no concurrent measurement gap is assocated with that SSB based
> intra-frequency measurements.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

> \- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap.
>
> \- when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap and all the SMTC
> occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object with NCSG, and
measurement gap is configured.

\- When UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement and indicates *no-gap-with-interruption* via
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for the intra-frequency measurement, and
SMTC is partially overlapping with GAP

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2.7 applies for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
corresponding to an activated serving cell, when all of the SMTC
occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped by
the NCSG;

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object corresponding to an
activated serving cell (in non-dormancy) when UE supports
*nr-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17* and indicates 'ncsg' in
*NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for intra-frequency measurement and all or part
of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are
overlapped by the NCSG;

\- SSB-based intra-frequency measurement object corresponding to a
deactivated serving cell or to an activated serving cell in dormancy
when all or part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency
measurement object are overlapped by the NCSG.

Editor's note: RAN4 has to decide the UE behaviour when DRX is
condigured whether interruptions are allowed.

### 9.2.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2 apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2 and 10.1.3
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7 and 10.1.8
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12 and 10.1.13
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
band.

### 9.2.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell (except for the
SCell) is not smaller than the number of configured RLM-RS SSB
resources.

#### 9.2.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For one single intra-frequency layer in a band, during each layer 1
measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP,
SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 6 identified cells, and

\- 24 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI,

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC when UE is configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the
band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with EN-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with NR-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- One of the SCCs on which UE is configured to report SSB based
measurements when neither PCC nor PSCC is in the same band, so that the
selected SCC shall be an SCC where the UE is configured with SS-RSRP
measurement reporting if such SCC exists, otherwise the selected SCC is
determined by UE implementation.

The UE shall also be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least 2 SSBs on serving cell for each of the other
intra-frequency layer(s) in the same band.

### 9.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodic
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.2.1
(RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for FR1),
10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1
(RS-SINR for FR2).

#### 9.2.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1
(RSRQ for FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and
10.1.13.1 (RS-SINR for FR2).

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2.4.3.

#### 9.2.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for
FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1
(RS-SINR for FR2).

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause
9.2.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.
In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2. If a cell which has been
detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~
defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2 becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again with the
same spatial reception parameter and triggers an event, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap has
not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the
SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3
filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected. In EN-DC and
NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform E-UTRA SRS
carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected in FR1 if
the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be expected
in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

#### 9.2.4.4 SCell activation Triggered Reporting

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE supporting
*l3-MeasUnknownSCellActivation-r18* and reporting valid L3 measurement
results after receiving the SCell activation command for unknown SCell.

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in SCell
activation triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ
for FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and
10.1.13.1 (RS-SINR for FR2).

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the SCell
activation command that will trigger a measurement report and the point
when the UE starts to transmit the valid measurement report over the air
interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources being available for UE to send the
measurement report on.

The SCell activation triggered measurement reporting delay shall be no
larger than T~HARQ~ + 3 ms + 4 ms, where

\- T~HARQ~ is the timing between DL data transmission and
acknowledgement in ms as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\],

\- 3 ms is the MAC CE decoding time.

\- 4 ms is the processing time for preparing L3 report triggered by MAC
CE.

\- UE is expected to report the L3 results no earlier than 3 ms +
T~HARQ~ after receiving the SCell activation command.

The SCell activation triggered report is considered as valid if it
fulfils the measurement requirements for a deactivated SCell as
specified in table 9.2.5.2-3 (for FR1) and table 9.2.5.2-4 (for FR2).

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the SCell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2.5.1. If a SCell which has been detectable at least
for the time period T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.2.5.1 becomes
undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the SCell becomes
detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter, this cell is
considered as detected provided the timing to that cell has not changed
more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap has not been
available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the SCS
configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\].

### 9.2.5 Intrafrequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2.5.1 Intrafrequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if the UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
intra frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It
is assumed that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD
and FR2 with SCS smaller or equal to 480 kHz.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ + T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection

When UE supports \[*MUSIM-GapConfig-17\]* and the SMTC occasion of the
target frequency layer is overlapping with the configured aperiodic
MUSIM gap, longer cell identification period for the target frequency
layer is expected.

#### 9.2.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2.5.2-1, 9.2.5.2-2, 9.2.5.2-3 (CC with deactivated
SCell), 9.2.5.2-4 (CC with deactivated SCell), 9.2.5.2-8 (deactivated
SCG applicable for PSCell) or 9.2.5.2-9 (deactivated SCG applicable for
PSCell). When *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured,
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is specified in table 9.2.5.2-5. When
UE *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is configured, if SMTC ≤ 40ms,
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is given in table 9.2.5.2-7;
otherwise, T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is given in table
9.2.5.2-2. For power class 6 UE supporting *measEnhCAInterFreqFR2-r18*
when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is configured, the
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is given in table 9.2.5.2-7 (if SMTC
≤ 40ms) and table 9.2.5.2-2 (if SMTC \> 40ms) *shall apply for SCC*.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2*
is present and smtc1 is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and
*smtc2* is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are
not specified for T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, an SMTC occasion is only considered to be
overlapped by Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

If MCG DRX is in use, measurement period requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in table 9.2.5.2-1, table
9.2.5.2-2, table 9.2.5.2-3 and table 9.2.5.2-4 shall depend on the MCG
DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, measurement period requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in SCG specified in table 9.2.5.2-1, table
9.2.5.2-2, table 9.2.5.2-3, table 9.2.5.2-4, table 9.2.5.2-8 and table
9.2.5.2-9, shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the
requirements for when DRX is not in use shall apply.

For FR2, a longer measurement period is allowed, if aperiodic CSI-RS
resource is measured for L1-RSRP measurement on any FR2 serving
frequency in the same band, and the CSI-RS resource is outside
measurement gap and overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols. If *SSB-ToMeasure* or *SS-RSSI-Measurement* is configured, the
SSB symbols are indicated by the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects on the same band which can be merged
and the RSSI symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*.

Table 9.2.5.2-13: Void

#### 9.2.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

UE shall be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the SSB
is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE, or the
UE indicates *no-gap-no-interruption* for intra-frequency measurement,
or the UE indicates *no-gap-with-interruption* for intra-frequency
measurement. When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met,
there are restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there
is no scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the
union set of SSB-ToMeasure from all the configured measurement objects
on the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is
configured; otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window
duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, the requirements in clause 9.2.5.3 also
apply when a Pre-MG is deactivated.

For UE supporting concurrent measurement gaps, when concurrent gaps are
configured, the requirements in clause 9.2.5.3 are also applied to the
slots that are not interrupted according to requirements in clause
9.1.8.3.

\[For UE supporting MUSIM gaps, when MUSIM gaps are configured, the
requirements in clause 9.2.5.3 are also applied to the slots that are
not interrupted according to requirements in clauses 9.1.10.5 and
9.1.10.6.\]

##### 9.2.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to
be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to
be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer in TS 38.331
\[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is configured, the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to
be measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration.
If the high layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331
\[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1.*

When TDD intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all
other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

When TDD inter-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to another serving
cell in a different band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols, if UE does not have the
capability of supporting *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this band
pair.

When inter-band FR1+FR1 NR-DC is performed, the scheduling restrictions
due to a given serving cell also apply to another serving cell in a
different band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the
aforementioned restricted symbols, if UE does not have the capability of
supporting *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this band pair.

##### 9.2.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

If the following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

The UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH
CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all
other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

##### 9.2.5.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR
measurement on an FR2 intra-frequency cell

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on K data symbol(s) before each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and K data symbol(s) after each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled and the SCS of data and
SSB symbols are smaller than 960 kHz, the UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols
within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled and the SCS of data or
SSB symbols is 960 kHz, the UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI SSB symbols to
be measured, and on K' data symbol(s) before each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured and K' data symbol(s) after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration.

The following scheduling restriction applies to SS-RSRQ measurement on
an FR2 intra-frequency cell

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on K data
symbol(s) before each consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and K
data symbol(s) after each consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols
within SMTC window duration

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ or SS-SINR measurement on an FR2 intra-frequency cell
in different bands, provided that UE is capable of independent beam
management on this FR2 band pair. Additionally, there is no scheduling
restriction if the UE is configured with different numerology between
SSB on one FR2 band and data on the other FR2 band provided the UE is
configured for IBM operation for the band pair.

NOTE: When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the
scheduling restrictions as defined in clause 9.2.5.3.1 due to a given
serving cell also apply to another serving cell in a different FR2 band
on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the aforementioned
restricted symbols, if UE does not have the capability of supporting
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this FR2 band pair.

If following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, the
UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, the
UE shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that the UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured.

##### 9.2.5.3.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR2 serving cell frequency layer. However, the
scheduling restrictions as defined in clause 9.2.5.3.1 due to a given
serving cell in FR2 also apply to another serving cell in an FR1 band on
the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the aforementioned
restricted symbols, if UE does not have the capability of supporting
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this FR1-FR2 band pair.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR1 serving cell frequency layer. However, the
scheduling restrictions as defined in clause 9.2.5.3.1 due to a given
serving cell in FR1 also apply to another serving cell in an FR2 band on
the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the aforementioned
restricted symbols, if UE does not have the capability of supporting
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* for this FR1-FR2 band pair.

#### 9.2.5.4 SFTD Measurements between PCell and PSCell

##### 9.2.5.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains SFTD measurement requirements for UE which supports
NR-DC and is configured with a PSCell in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The UE
shall perform SFTD measurement between PCell and PSCell, and report the
SFTD result with/without SS-RSRP after the network requests with
*reportType* for the associated *reportConfig* set to *reportSFTD*. The
overall delay includes RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\], and SFTD measurement reporting delay in clause
9.2.5.4.3.

##### 9.2.5.4.2 SFTD Measurement delay

When no DRX is used in either of PCell and PSCell, the physical layer
measurement period of the SFTD measurement shall be T~measure\_SFTD1~ =
max(200, 5 x SMTC period) ms, where the SMTC period refers to the
maximum between the configured SMTC period in PCell and PSCell.

When DRX is used in either of the PCell or the PSCell, or in both PCell
and PSCell, the physical layer measurement period (T~measure\_SFTD1~) of
the SFTD measurement shall be as specified in table 9.2.5.4.2-1.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If PSCell is changed without changing carrier frequency of PSCell, while
the UE is performing SFTD measurements, the UE shall still meet SFTD
measurement and accuracy requirements for the new PSCell. In this case
the UE shall restart the SFTD measurement, and the total physical layer
measurement period shall not exceed T~measure\_SFTD2~ as defined by the
following expression:

T~measure\_SFTD2~ = (M+1)\*(T~measure\_SFTD1~) +
M\*T~PSCell\_change\_NRDC~

where:

M is the number of times the NR PSCell is changed over the measurement
period (T~measure\_SFTD2~), and

T~PSCell\_change\_NRDC~ is the time necessary to change the PSCell; it
can be up to 25 ms.

If PCell is changed, or if PSCell is changed with different carrier
frequency from PSCell, the UE shall terminate SFTD measurements.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement when DRX is used as
well as when no DRX is used shall be as specified in the clause 10.1.21.

##### 9.2.5.4.3 SFTD Measurement Reporting Delay

*The SFTD measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between a
command that will trigger an SFTD measurement report and the point when
the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface.* This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This measurement reporting delay excludes any delay
caused by no UL resources available for UE to send the measurement
report.

The SFTD measurement reporting delay shall be less than measurement
period defined in clause 9.2.5.4.2 plus the RRC procedure delay defined
in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.2.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2.6.1 Void

#### 9.2.6.2 Intra-frequency cell identification

When a measurement gap is provided or an activated Pre-MG is provided
without any pre-MG status changed during the measurement period, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
intra-frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It
is assumed that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD
and FR2 with SCS smaller or equal to 480 kHz.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in tables 9.2.6.2-1, 9.2.6.2-2 or 9.2.6.2-9.

\- For UE supporting power class 6 with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*
configured, if SMTC ≤ 40ms, T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ is given in table
9.2.6.2-9; otherwise, T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ is given in table
9.2.6.2-2.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2.6.2-3 or 9.2.6.2-10
(for FR2-2).

\- For UE indicating *support3MHz-ChannelBW-Symmetric-r18* and
configured to operate on a target cell with 12 PRB SSB in FR1,
T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_less\_than\_5Mhz~ is given in table
9.2.6.2-12.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.2.6.3-1 or 9.2.6.3-2.

\- For UE supporting power class 6 with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*
configured, if SMTC ≤ 40ms, T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is given
in table 9.2.6.3-4; otherwise, T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is
given in table 9.2.6.3-2.

\- For power class 6 UE supporting *measEnhCAInterFreqFR2-r18* when
*highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is configured, the
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ given in table 9.2.6.3-4 (if SMTC ≤
40ms) and table 9.2.6.3-2 (if SMTC \> 40ms) *shall apply for SCC*.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with or the UE does not support** **concurrent GAPs
or MUSIM gaps. Otherwise,** K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where
N~available~ and N~total~ are calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period, xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE GAPs, periodic MUSIM gaps
and per-FR GAPs within the same FR as the SSB frequency layer, and
starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other GAP and MUSIM gap occasions
within the window**, and**

**N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap **within the
window W after accounting for GAP** and MUSIM gap **collisions by
applying the collision rules for GAP** and MUSIM gap **in clauses
9.1.8.3**, 9.1.10.4**,** 9.1.10.5, **9.1.12.3, and 9.1.13.3,**
respectively**.**

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG, also xRP = MGRP for periodic MUSIM
gap.

When concurrent GAPs are configured, requirements in this clause do not
apply if N~available~ =0.

When UE supports \[*MUSIM-GapConfig-17*\] and the configured aperiodic
MUSIM gap collides with the measurement gap associated with the target
frequency layer, where MUSIM gap collision rule in clause 9.1.10.4 is
applied, longer cell identification period for the target
intra-frequency is expected.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_with\_gaps~ : For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 1
or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~=40. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power
class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2-1
power class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting
FR2-1 power class 4, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a UE
supporting FR2-1 power class 6, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a
UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ = 60.
For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ =
36. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 3,
M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_gaps~ = 36.

M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~: For a UE supporting FR2-1 power class 1
or 5, M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ =40. For a UE supporting FR2-1 power
class 2, M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2-1
power class 3, M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting
FR2-1 power class 4, M~meas\_period\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a UE
supporting FR2-1 power class 6, M~meas\_period\ with\_gaps~ =24. For a
UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1, M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ = 60.
For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2, M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ =
36. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 3,
M~meas\_period\_\ with\_gaps~ = 36.

\- M~SSB\_index\_intra~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 72. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2,
M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 48. For a UE supporting FR2 power class 3,
M~SSB\_index\_intra~ = 48.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~

If MCG DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in table 9.2.6.2-1, table
9.2.6.2-2, and table 9.2.6.2-3 shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG
DRX is in use, cell identification requirements for intra-frequency
measurement in SCG specified in table 9.2.6.2-1, table 9.2.6.2-2, and
table 9.2.6.2-3 shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the
requirements for when DRX is not in use shall apply.

#### 9.2.6.3 Intra-frequency Measurement Period

The requirements in this clause apply when a measurement gap is provided
or when an activated Pre-MG is provided without any pre-MG status
changed during the measurement period.

The measurement period for FR1 intra-frequency measurements with gaps is
as shown in table 9.2.6.3-1.

The measurement period for FR2 intra-frequency measurements with gaps is
as shown in table 9.2.6.3-2.

When *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured, T
~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is specified in table 9.2.6.3-3.

For UE supporting power class 6 with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*
configured, if SMTC ≤ 40ms, T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is given
in table 9.2.6.3-4; otherwise, T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is
given in table 9.2.6.3-2.

For power class 6 UE supporting *measEnhCAInterFreqFR2-r18* when
*highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is configured, the
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ is given in table 9.2.6.3-4 (if SMTC
≤ 40ms) and table 9.2.6.3-2 (if SMTC \> 40ms) *shall apply for SCC*.

If MCG DRX is in use, measurement period requirements for
intra-frequency measurement in MCG specified in table 9.2.6.3-1 and
table 9.2.6.3-2, shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in
use, measurement period requirements for intra-frequency measurement in
SCG specified in table 9.2.6.3-1and table 9.2.6.3-2, shall depend on the
SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use
shall apply.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer measurement period would
be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested
to decode an NR CGI.

### 9.2.7 Intra-frequency measurements with NCSG

#### 9.2.7.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

For the UE supporting NCSG, if NCSG is provided, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise, UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~ It is assumed
that *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2.7.1-1, 9.2.7.1-2, 9.2.7.1-4 (deactivated Scell) or
9.2.7.1-5 (deactivated SCell).

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2.7.1-3 or 9.2.7.1-6
(deactivated SCell).

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.2.7.2-1, 9.2.7.2-2, 9.2.7.2-3,
9.2.7.2-4 (deactivated SCell) or 9.2.7.2-5 (deactivated SCell).

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ in clause 9.1.5.3 for measurement
conducted within NCSG.

> K~NCSG~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
> within an associated NCSG pattern. K~NCSG~ **= 1** when the UE is not
> **configured with concurrent GAPs. Otherwise,** K~NCSG~ = **N~total~ /
> N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are calculated as
> follows:**
>
> For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ xRP\_max), where
> xRP\_max is the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE GAP and
> per-FR GAP within the same FR as the SSB frequency layer, and starting
> from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:
>
> **- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered
> by instances of the associated NCSG **within the window W,** including
> **those overlapped** with other GAP occasions within the window**,
> and**
>
> **- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
> instances of the non-dropped associated NCSG **within the window W
> after accounting for GAP collisions by applying the GAP collision rule
> in clauses 9.1.8.3, 9.1.12.3, and 9.1.13.3.**
>
> **- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is MG, and xRP = VIRP when
> configured GAP is NCSG.**
>
> When concurrent GAPs are configured, requirements in this clause do
> not apply if N~available~ =0.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_with\_ncsg~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_ncsg~=40. For a UE supporting FR2 power class
2, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_ncsg~ =24. For a UE supporting FR2 power class
3, M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_ncsg~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 4,
M~pss/sss\_sync\ with\_ncsg~ =24

M~meas\_period\_\ with\_ncsg~: For a UE supporting power class 1 or 5,
M~meas\_period\_\ with\_ncsg~ =40. For a UE supporting power class 2,
M~meas\_period\_\ with\_ncsg~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 3,
M~meas\_period\_\ with\_ncsg~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 4,
M~meas\_period\ with\_ncsg~ =24.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and smtc1 is fully overlapping with NCSG and smtc2 is partially
overlapping with NCSG, requirements are not specified for
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~

#### 9.2.7.3 Scheduling availability during intra-frequency measurement with NCSG

Scheduling availability specified in clause 9.2.5.3 applies to
scheduling availability during intra-frequency measurement with NCSG.

9.2A NR intra-frequency measurements with CCA
---------------------------------------------

### 9.2A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.2.A apply for intra-frequency measurements
on carrier frequency with CCA.

When the intra-frequency measurement is performed on a neighbour cell in
FR2-2 with shared spectrum channel access, UE shall determine the CCA
mode of the neighbour cell according to *channelAccessMode2-r17* of the
cell configured in *MeasObjectNR*. If *channelAccessMode2-r17* of the
cell is enabled, UE shall assume that CCA applies to the cell and
perform measurement accordingly, and the requirements in clause 9.2A
shall apply; otherwise, UE shall assume that CCA does not apply to the
cell and perform measurement accordingly, and requirements in clause 9.2
shall apply.

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or the
PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP\[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2A.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching
time is 0.5 ms for frequency range FR1 and 0.25 ms for frequency range
FR2-2.

In the requirements of clause 9.2A, the term SMTC occasion not available
at the UE refers to when the SMTC contains SSBs configured by gNB in a
cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but *N~SSB~* candidate SSB
positions for the same SSB index within the discovery burst transmission
window are not available at the UE due to DL CCA failures at gNB during
the corresponding period, where:

\- For the cell detection procedure: *N~SSB~* is at least one candidate
SSB position (NOTE: the one candidate SSB position for the cell
detection shall not be impacted by the set of candidate SSB positions
which are already being measured by the UE within the current
measurement period of the on-going measurements), and

\- For other procedures in clause 9.2A: *N~SSB~* are the first two
successive candidate SSB positions when two or more candidate SSB
positions are configured for this SSB index in one discovery burst
transmission window, otherwise *N~SSB~* is one candidate SSB position;

Otherwise, the SMTC occasion is considered as available at the UE.

For the FR2-2 requirements of clause 9.2A, an SMTC occasion group
consists of N consecutive SMTC occasions, where N is the UE Rx beam
sweeping scaling factor. An SMTC occasion group is not available, when
at least one SMTC occasion in the group is not transmitted by the gNB.

### 9.2A.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2A apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.27 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clause 10.1.29 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clause 10.1.31 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.8 for a corresponding
band.

### 9.2A.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2A.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell (except for the
SCell) is not smaller than the number of configured RLM-RS SSB
resources.

#### 9.2A.3.2 Requirements for FR2-2

For one single intra-frequency layer in a band, during each layer 1
measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP,
SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 6 identified cells, and

\- 24 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI,

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC when UE is configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the
band; or

\- PSCC when UE is configured with NR-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- One of the SCCs on which UE is configured to report SSB based
measurements when neither PCC nor PSCC is in the same band, so that the
selected SCC shall be an SCC where the UE is configured with SS-RSRP
measurement reporting if such SCC exists, otherwise the selected SCC is
determined by UE implementation.

The UE shall also be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least 2 SSBs on serving cell for each of the other
intra-frequency layer(s) in the same band.

### 9.2A.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

9.2A.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodically
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1. 36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2),10.1.29(RSRQ for FR1), TBD
(RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD (RS-SINR for FR2-2),
respectively.

9.2A.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodically
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2), 10.1.29 (RSRQ for FR1),
TBD (RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD (RS-SINR for
FR2-2), respectively.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2A.4.3.

9.2A.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodically
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2), 10.1.29 (RSRQ for FR1),
TBD (RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD (RS-SINR for
FR2-2), respectively.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on, and
all delays due to UL CCA failures until the successful transmission of
the report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_CCA~ or
T~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_CCA~ defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or
clause 9.2A.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA~ as defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or
clause 9.2A.6.2. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the
time period T~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_CCA~ or
T~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_CCA~ defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or
clause 9.2A.6.2 becomes undetectable for a period≤ 8 seconds and then
the cell becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception
parameter and triggers an event, the event triggered measurement
reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ Tc while the measurement gap
has not been available and the L3 filter has not been used, where *µ* is
the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.2A.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

9.2A.5.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise, UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
intra-frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~
+ T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\ CCA~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2A.5.1-1, 9.2A.5.1-3 (deactivated Scell) .

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2A.5.1-2 or
9.2A.5.1-4 (deactivated SCell).

T ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~: equal to a measurement period
of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2A.5.2-1, 9.2A.5.2-2
(deactivated SCell).

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

\- according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully non overlapping or partially overlapping with measurement gaps, or
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

\- M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 1, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting
FR2-2 power class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE
supporting FR2-2 power class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

\- M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 1, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2
power class 2, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE supporting
FR2-2 power class 3, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

\- M~SSB\_index\_intra\_CCA:~ For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 72 samples. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 2, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 3, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples.

N: is the UE Rx beam sweeping scaling factor. N = 12.

When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, K~p~=1

When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP.

For FR2-2,

K~layer1\_measurement~=TBD

If MCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification requirements
specified in table 9.2A.5.1-1, table 9.2A.5.1-2, table 9.2A.5.1-3, table
9.2A.5.1-4, table 9.2A.5.1-5 and table 9.2A.5.1-6 shall depend on the
MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification
requirements specified in table 9.2A.5.1-1, table 9.2A.5.1-2, table
9.2A.5.1-3, table 9.2A.5.1-4, table 9.2A.5.1-5 and table 9.2A.5.1-6
shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when
DRX is not in use shall apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

#### 9.2A.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2A.5.2-1, 9.2A.5.2-2 (deactivated SCell).

If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency measurement period requirements
specified in table 9.2A.5.2-1, table 9.2A.5.2-2 shall depend on the SCG
DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use shall
apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

When the time period of unsuccessful measurement attempts due to
exceeding the maximum number of unavailable at the UE SMTC occasions of
an already identified cell exceeds the maximum time requirement for the
cell to remain known defined in clause 9.2A.4.3, UE shall stop the
measurement attempts on this SSB and ***perform the detection procedure
again like for any other SSB***.

#### 9.2A.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

UE shall be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the SSB
is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When any
of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on
the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within SMTC window duration defined in
clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

##### 9.2A.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols
> configured to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each
> consecutive SSB symbols configured to be measured and 1 data symbol
> after each consecutive SSB symbols configured to be measured within
> SMTC window duration if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled. If the
> high layer in TS 38.331\[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured, the
> SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows
> *smtc1*.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols
within SMTC window duration if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled.
If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1*.

When the UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols
configured to be measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data
symbol before each consecutive SSB configured to be measured/RSSI
symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB configured to be
measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled. If the high layer signaling of
*smtc2* is configured (in TS 38.331), the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1*.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols
within SMTC window duration if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled.
If the high layer in TS 38.331 signaling of smtc2 is configured, the
SMTC periodicity follows smtc2; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows
smtc1.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in unlicensed spectrum is performed,
the scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to
all other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.2A.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

##### 9.2A.5.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR2-2

The requirements in clause 9.2.5.3.3 apply.

### 9.2A.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2A.6.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_CCA~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise, UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
intra-frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA.~ The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\ CCA.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\ CCA~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_CCA~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2A.6.1-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_CCA~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2A.6.1-2.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_CCA~: equal to a measurement period
of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2A.6.2-1 or 9.2A.6.1-3.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
1, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2
power class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE
supporting FR2-2 power class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
1, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 2, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36. For a UE supporting FR2-2
power class 3, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\ CCA~ = 36.

\- M~SSB\_index\_intra\_CCA:~ For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 72 samples. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 2, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 3, M~SSB\_index\_intra\ CCA~ = 48 samples.

N: is the UE Rx beam sweeping scaling factor. N = 12.

If MCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification requirements
specified in table 9.2A.6.1-1, table 9.2A.6.1-2 and table 9.2A.6.1-3
shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency
cell identification requirements specified in table 9.2A.6.1-1, table
9.2A.6.1-2 and table 9.2A.6.1-3 shall depend on the SCG DRX cycle.
Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in use shall apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

#### 9.2A.6.2 Intra-frequency Measurement Period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements with gaps is as
shown in table 9.2A.6.2-1.

If MCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency cell identification requirements
specified in table 9.2A.6.2-1 and 9.2A.6.2-2 shall depend on the MCG DRX
cycle. If SCG DRX is in use, intra-frequency measurement period
requirements specified in table 9.2A.6.2-1 and 9.2A.6.2-2 shall depend
on the SCG DRX cycle. Otherwise, the requirements for when DRX is not in
use shall apply.

The requirements apply provided any two closest SMTC occasions available
at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more than the
maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known defined in clause
9.2A.4.3.

When the time period of unsuccessful measurement attempts due to
exceeding the maximum number of unavailable at the UE SMTC occasions of
an already identified cell exceeds the maximum time requirement for the
cell to remain known defined in clause 9.2A.4.3, UE shall stop the
measurement attempts on this SSB and perform the detection procedure
again like for any other SSB.

### 9.2A.7 Intra-frequency RSSI and Channel occupancy measurements

#### 9.2A.7.1 Intra-frequency RSSI measurements

An RSSI measurement is defined as an intra-frequency measurement
provided that the RSSI measurement bandwidth is fully contained within
the current carrier bandwidth of the UE.

The UE physical layer shall be capable of performing the RSSI
measurements, defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] on one or more serving carriers
operating with CCA, TS 37.213 \[33\], if the carrier(s) are indicated by
higher layers \[2\], and report the RSSI measurements to higher layers.
The UE physical layer shall provide to higher layers a single RSSI
sample for each OFDM symbol within each configured RSSI measurement
duration \[2\] occurring with a configured RSSI measurement timing
configuration periodicity \[2\], *rmtc-Periodicity*.

The UE can perform RSSI measurements without measurement gaps if RSSI
measurement bandwidth is fully within the active DL BWP of the UE.

For performing intra-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2, UE shall
assume the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD
to the DL RS associated with the TCI state provided in the RMTC
configuration. UE does not expect to be configured with an explicit
TCI-state in RMTC-Config with a reference serving cell in FR1 or FR2-1.
If no TCI state is provided in the RMTC configuration, UE shall assume
the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD to one
of the latest received PDSCH and the latest monitored CORESET in the
active BWP of the current carrier in FR2-2.

For RSSI measurement in FR2-2 with SCS of 480 kHz or 960 kHz, the RSSI
measurement results shall be derived based on symbols configured by RMTC
except for the first symbol and the last symbol in RMTC, and there is no
requirement when *measDurationSymbols* is configured as 1.

The measurement period for intra-frequency RSSI measurements without
measurement gaps is as shown in table 9.2A.7.1-1 and table 9.2A.7.1-2,
for FR1, and in table 9.2A.7.4-1 and table 9.2A.7.5-1 for FR2-2. The
measurement period for intra-frequency RSSI measurements with
measurement gaps is as shown in table 9.2A.7.1-3, for FR1 and in table
9.2A.7.1-6 for FR2-2.

measurements without measurement gaps when SMTC and RMTC are overlapping

If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform intra-frequency
measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent intra-frequency measurements, including intra-frequency RSSI
measurements. The RSSI measurement duration and the measurement gap
shall be aligned, and the following additional condition shall be
fulfilled:

\- Entire RSSI measurement duration is contained in the measurement gap.

The RSSI measurement performed and reported according to this clause
shall meet the RSSI measurement accuracy requirement in clause
10.1.34.1. The reported RSSI measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1.34.3.

#### 9.2A.7.2 Intra-frequency Channel occupancy measurements

The UE shall be capable of estimating the channel occupancy on one or
more serving carrier frequencies indicated by higher layers \[2\], based
on RSSI samples provided by the physical layer.

The UE can perform channel occupancy measurements without measurement
gaps if RSSI measurement bandwidth is fully within the active DL BWP of
the UE.

The measurement period for intra-frequency channel occupancy
measurements without measurement gap is as shown in table 9.2A.7.2-1 and
table 9.2A.7.1-2 for FR1, and in table 9.2A.7.2-4 and table 9.2A.7.1-5
for FR2-2. The measurement period for intra-frequency RSSI measurements
with measurement gaps is as shown in table 9.2A.7.2-3 for FR1, and in
table 9.2A.7.2-6 for FR2-2.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform intra-frequency
measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent intra-frequency measurements, including intra-frequency RSSI
measurements. The RSSI measurement duration and the measurement gap
shall be aligned, and the following additional condition shall be
fulfilled:

\- Entire RSSI measurement duration is contained in the measurement gap.

The channel occupancy measurement performed and reported according to
this clause shall meet the channel occupancy measurement accuracy
requirements in clause 10.1.35.1. The reported channel occupancy
measurement values contained in measurement reports shall be based on
the measurement reporting range specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

#### 9.2A.7.3 Scheduling restriction during RSSI and Channel Occupancy measurements in FR1

When the UE performs intra-frequency RSSI/CO measurements in unlicensed
spectrum, the following restrictions apply due to RSSI/CO measurements:

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on UL symbols
which are overlapping in time with the RSSI measurement symbols
configured by RMTC.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in unlicensed spectrum is performed,
the scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to
all other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

#### 9.2A.7.4 Scheduling restriction during RSSI measurements in FR2-2

When the UE performs intra-frequency RSSI measurements in unlicensed
spectrum, the following restrictions apply due to RSSI measurements:

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on UL symbols
which are overlapping in time with the RSSI measurement symbols
configured by RMTC.

\- The UE is not expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
symbols which are overlapping in time with RSSI measurement symbols
configured by RMTC if the RSSI measurement resources are not QCL-ed with
typeD to the DL RS in the active TCI state of PDCCH/PDSCH.

\- For 480 kHz and 960 kHz, The UE is not expected to receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols which are overlapping in time
with the first and last RSSI measurement symbols configured by RMTC.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in unlicensed spectrum is performed,
the scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to
all other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

9.2B NR intra-frequency measurements for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------

### 9.2B.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the reference SSB of the serving cell
and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour cell are the same,
and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also the same. The
reference SSB is the **SSB defined in BWP-specific *servingCellMO* under
*BWP-DownlinkDedicated* of active DL BWP. If the field is absent,** the
reference SSB is the SSB defined in *servingCellMO* under
*ServingCellConfig \[2\]***.**

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP \[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2B.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching
time is 0.5 ms for frequency range FR1 and 0.25 ms for frequency range
FR2.

### 9.2B.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2B apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

> \- For 2Rx RedCap:
>
> \- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2 and 10.1.3
> for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,
>
> \- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7 and 10.1.8
> for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,
>
> \- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12 and
> 10.1.13 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,
>
> \- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
> band.
>
> \- For 1Rx RedCap:
>
> \- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.2 for FR1
> for a corresponding band,
>
> \- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.6 for FR1
> for a corresponding band,
>
> \- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.10 for FR1
> for a corresponding band,
>
> \- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.15 for a
> corresponding band.

### 9.2B.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2B.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell is not smaller than
the number of configured RLM-RS SSB resources.

#### 9.2B.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For one single intra-frequency layer in a band, during each layer 1
measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP,
SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 6 identified cells, and

\- 24 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI,

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC when UE is configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the
band.

### 9.2B.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2B.4.1 Periodic Reporting

For 2Rx RedCap: The requirements in clause 9.2.4.1 shall apply.

For 1Rx RedCap: Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1A.2.1 (SS-RSRP for FR1), 10.1A.6.1 (SS-RSRQ for FR1) and
10.1A.10.1 (SS-SINR for FR1), respectively.

#### 9.2B.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

For 2Rx RedCap: The requirements in clause 9.2.4.2 shall apply.

For 1Rx RedCap: Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.1A.2.1 (SS-RSRP for FR1), 10.1A.6.1 (SS-RSRQ
for FR1) and 10.1A.10.1 (SS-SINR for FR1), respectively.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2B.4.3.

#### 9.2B.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

For 2Rx RedCap: The requirements in clause 9.2.4.3 shall apply.

For 1Rx RedCap: Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.1A.2.1 (SS-RSRP for FR1), 10.1A.6.1 (SS-RSRQ
for FR1) and 10.1A.10.1 (SS-SINR for FR1), respectively.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_RedCap~ or
T~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_RedCap~ defined in clause 9.2B.5.1 or
clause 9.2B.6.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~ as defined in clause 9.2B.5.1 or
clause 9.2B.6.1. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the
time period T~identify\ intra\ without\ index\_RedCap~ or
T~identify\ intra\ with\ index\_RedCap~ defined in clause 9.2B.5.1 or
clause 9.2B.6.1 becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then
the cell becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception
parameter and triggers an event, the event triggered measurement
reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~ provided the timing to that
cell has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement
gap has not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ*
is the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\].
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.2B.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2B.5.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if the UE is not
indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated
SSB index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap.~ It is assumed that
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_RedCap~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra\_RedCap~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in tables 9.2B.5.1-1, 9.2B.5.1-2, 9.2B.5.1-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra\_RedCap~: it is the time period used to
acquire the index of the SSB being measured given in tables 9.2B.5.1-4,
9.2B.5.1-5

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~: equal to a measurement
period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.2B.5.2-1, table
9.2B.5.2-2, table 9.2B.5.2-3.

CSSF~intra\_RedCap~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in clause 9.1A.5.1
for measurement conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when
intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping or partially overlapping
with measurement gaps, or according to CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in
clause 9.1A.5.2 for measurement conducted within measurement gaps, i.e.
when intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise
the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions corresponds to
the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

> For 2Rx RedCap:

M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ : For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 1 or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ =40. For a UE
supporting power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~pss/sss\_sync\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~
=24.

> M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ : For a UE supporting power class 1
> or 5, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ =40. For a UE supporting FR2
> power class 2, 3, 4, or 7, M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps\_RedCap~ =24.

When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, K~p~=1.

When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. For
calculation of K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\]) of
*smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List* parameter
in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC periodicity
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1.*

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2*
is present and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and
*smtc2* is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are
not specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index\_RedCap~

For FR2,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and *SS-RSSI-Measurement* are
configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by the union set
of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on the
same serving carrier which can be merged. and RSSI symbols are indicated
by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

#### 9.2B.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2B.5.2-1, 9.2B.5.2-2, 9.2B.5.2-3.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2*
is present and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and
smtc2 is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are
not specified for T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_RedCap~.

For FR2, a longer measurement period is allowed, if aperiodic CSI-RS
resource is measured for L1-RSRP measurement on any FR2 serving
frequency in the same band, and the CSI-RS resource is outside
measurement gap and overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols. If *SSB-ToMeasure* or *SS-RSSI-Measurement* is configured, the
SSB symbols are indicated by the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects on the same band which can be merged

#### 9.2B.6.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if UE is not indicated

UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block
of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index\_RedCap.~ It is assumed that
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

9.2C NR intra-frequency measurements for SAN
--------------------------------------------

### 9.2C.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.2C apply for intra-frequency measurements
on an SAN carrier frequency. The requirements apply provided that the
valid parameters of ephemeris information, epoch time of the ephemeris,
common TA, validity timer information, downlink polarization information
for target NR SAN cell are send to UE.

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement, or

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP\[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2C.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or more measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements,

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is not configured, up to two measurement
window periodicities may be configured with *SSB-MTC* and *SSB-MTC2*

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is configured, multiple measurement window
offsets may be configured with *SSB-MTC* and *SSB-MTC4List-r17*, and the
requirements in clause 9.2C apply provided that the total number of
measurement window offsets does not exceed the UE capability
*parallelSMTC-r17*

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching
time is 0.5 ms for frequency range FR1.

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2C.5 applies
for the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

\- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

\- When none of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

\- When part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the measurement gap.

The intra-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.2C.6 applies
for the following scenarios:

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with measurement gap,

\- SSB based intra-frequency measurements with no measurement gap,

\- for a UE supporting concurrent gaps and when concurrent gaps are
configured:

\- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap in the
concurrent measurement gaps, or

\- when part of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement object are overlapped
with the union of concurrent measurement gaps.

\- otherwise, for a UE not supporting concurrent gaps or if concurrent
gaps are not configured:

\- when all of the SMTC occasions of this intra-frequency measurement
object are overlapped with the measurement gap.

The requirements in clause 9.2C.7 and 9.2C.8 apply provided that the
measured NR SAN cell is served by the same satellite as the serving
cell.

### 9.2C.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2C apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

\- Valid information for the satellite serving the target cell has been
provided

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2C for FR1 and
10.1.3C for FR2-NTN, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7C for FR1 and
10.1.8C for FR2-NTN, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12C for FR1 and
10.1.13C for FR2-NTN, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.17 for a corresponding
band.

### 9.2C.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2C.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 8 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell (except for the
SCell) is not smaller than the number of configured RLM-RS SSB
resources.

\- 4 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI from neighbour cells in
GEO deployment.

\- In NGSO deployments: cells from 2 satellites including the satellite
serving the PCell if UE does not support the capability
*maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*; or cells from 3 or 4
satellites including the satellite serving the PCell, depending on the
value indicated in *maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*.

### 9.2C.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2C.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodic
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.2C.1
(RSRP for FR1) , 10.1.3C (RSRP for FR2-NTN), 10.1.7C.1 (RSRQ for FR1),

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2C.4.3.

#### 9.2C.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2C.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3C (RSRP for FR2-NTN), 10.1.7C.1 (RSRQ
for FR1), 10.1.8C (RSRQ for FR2-NTN), 10.1.12C.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and
10.1.13C (RS-SINR for FR2-NTN).

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ intra\ with\ index~ or
T~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ defined in clause 9.2C.5.1 or clause
9.2C.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2C.5.1 or clause 9.2C.6.2. When L3 filtering is
used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.2C.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2C.5.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if the UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~. The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2C.5.1-1

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2C.5.1-2

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.2C.5.2-1

K~multi\_SMTC~ is the scaling factor for measurement of multiple SMTCs
or multiple satellites, and

if SMTCs do not overlap with each other,

\- $K_{multi\_ SMTC} = 1$, if GEO satellites are measured on the
carrier;

\-
$K_{multi\_ SMTC} = \left\lceil \frac{N_{LEO,i}}{N_{LEO,simul}} \right\rceil$,
if LEO satellites are measured on the carrier;

if SMTCs partially overlap with each other,

\- $K_{multi\_ SMTC} = N_{SMTC,overlap}$, if only GEO satellites are
measured on the carrier;

\-
$K_{multi\_ SMTC} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{SMTC,overlap}}\left\lceil \frac{N_{LEO,i}}{N_{LEO,simul}} \right\rceil$,
if only LEO satellites are measured on the carrier;

where

\- $N_{LEO,i}$ is the number of LEO satellites to be measured within
i-th SMTC,

\- $N_{LEO,simul}$ is the number of LEO satellites that UE can measure
in parallel within an SMTC,

\- $N_{SMTC,overlap}$ is the number of SMTCs that partially overlap with
each other.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1.

> if the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
> configured, the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions
> corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise
> the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions corresponds
> to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

K~p~ is the scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = N~total\_SAN~ / N~available\_SAN~,
where N~available\_SAN~ and N~total\_SAN~ are calculated as follows:

> \- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
>
> \- If UE supports *parallelMeasurementGap-r17* and is configured with
> concurrent measurement gaps, MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all
> configured per-UE measurement gap. Otherwise, MGRP\_max is the MGRP of
> configured measurement gap.
>
> \- Starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:
>
> \- N~total\_SAN~ is the total number of SMTC occasions within the
> window, including those overlapped and non-overlapped with measurement
> gap occasions within the window, and
>
> \- N~available\_SAN~ is the number of SMTC occasions within the window
> W that do not collide with any non-dropped MG occasion within or
> outside the window W, after accounting for measurement gap collisions
> by applying the measurement gap collision rule in clause 9.1C.8.3. The
> collision rule between SMTC occasion and measurement gap occasion is
> defined in clause 9.1C.9.1
>
> K~p~ = \[1\] when N~available\_SAN~ = 0 and measurement gap sharing in
> clause 9.1.2.1a shall apply.
>
> K~p~ = 1 when intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with
> measurement gaps.
>
> For calculation of K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331
> \[2\]) of *smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List*
> parameter in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of
> higher layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC
> periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
> *smtc1.*

K~layer1\_measurement~: it is scaling factor for sharing between L3 and
L1 measurement, and K~layer1\_measurement~ =1, if GEO satellites are
measured on the carrier, or if LEO satellites are measured on the
carrier and UE supports *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17*,
otherwise

K~layer1\_measurement~ =1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap are not fully
overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped
by intra-frequency SMTC occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and
*SS-RSSI-Measurement* are configured, and RSSI symbols are indicated by
*SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~ =1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2*
is present and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and
*smtc2* is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are
not specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~

  NOTE 1: If different SMTC periodicities are configured for different cells, the SMTC period in the requirement is the one used by the cell being identified   

The UE is allowed to skip measurements on intra-frequency cells, in the
interval between *t-serviceStart* and the satellite switch completion,
when it is performing soft satellite switching with resynchronization.
In this case, for the measurement initiated but not completed before the
beginning interval, the total time to detection can be longer.

The requirements in clause 9.2C.5.1 and 9.2C.5.2 are not applicable when
the overall overhead ratio due to scheduling restriction caused by all
configured SMTCs (i.e. scheduling restriction overhead of all SMTCs in
one SMTC periodicity), is larger than 75%.

#### 9.2C.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2C.5.2-1.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2*
is present and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and
*smtc2* is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are
not specified for *T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~*

  NOTE 1: If different SMTC periodicities are configured for different cells, the SMTC period in the requirement is the one used by the cell being identified   

#### 9.2C.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on
the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included. For UL, the scheduling
restriction applies to UL symbols that fully or partially overlap with
the restricted symbols as defined below.

##### 9.2C.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

The UE is expected to receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to
be measured. if the following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

##### 9.2C.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on a neighbor cell served by a different satellite in LEO

For UE which does not support *the capability
parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17* the following restrictions
apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement on a neighbor cell served by
a different satellite in LEO.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

\- If the following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

\- The UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to
be measured.

### 9.2C.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2C.6.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
intra-frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2C.6.2-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2C.6.2-2.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.2C.6.3-1.

K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps.** When the UE is
**configured with concurrent measurement gaps and the two measurement
gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP=160ms, K~gap~ = 2. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap, and
starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other measurement gap occasions
within the window**, and**

**- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap **within the
window W after accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the
measurement gap collision rule in clause 9.1.8.3.**

> K~gap~ **is only applicable for UE supporting**
> *parallelMeasurementGap-r17***.** When concurrent measurement gaps are
> configured, requirements in this clause do not apply if N~available~
> =0, or if one SMTC overlaps more than one MGs associated to the
> frequency layer.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

K~multi\_SMTC~ is the scaling factor for measurement of multiple SMTCs
or multiple satellites, and

>
> \- $K_{multi\_ SMTC} = 1$, if GEO satellites are measured on the

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is

The UE is allowed to skip measurements on intra-frequency cells, in the
interval between *t-serviceStart* and the satellite switch completion,
when it is performing soft satellite switching with resynchronization.
In this case, for the measurement initiated but not completed before the
beginning of this interval, the total time to measure can be longer.

### 9.2C.7 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps for NTN band above 10 GHz

#### 9.2C.7.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if the UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
intra-frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2C.7.1-1

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2C.7.1-2

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.2C.7.2-1

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully non overlapping or partially overlapping with measurement gaps, or
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

K~p~ is the scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = N~total\_SAN~ / N~available\_SAN~,
where N~available\_SAN~ and N~total\_SAN~ are calculated as follows:

> \- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
>
> \- If UE is configured with concurrent measurement gaps, MGRP max is

> Otherwise, MGRP max is the MGRP of configured measurement gap.
>

> gap occasions within the window, and
>
> \- N~available\_SAN~ is the number of SMTC occasions within the window
> W that do not collide with any non-dropped MG occasion within or
> outside the window W, after accounting for measurement gap collisions
> by applying the measurement gap collision rule in clause 9.1C.8.3. The

> defined in clause 9.1C.9.1
>
> K~p~ = \[1\] when N~available\_SAN~ = 0 and measurement gap sharing in
> clause 9.1.2.1a shall apply.
>
> K~p~ = 1 when intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with
> measurement gaps.
>
> For calculation of K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331
> \[2\]) of *smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List*
> parameter in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of
> higher layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC
> periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
> *smtc1.*

K~layer1\_measurement~: it is scaling factor for sharing between L3 and
L1 measurement, and K~layer1\_measurement~ =1

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2*
is present and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and
smtc2 is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are
not specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~

#### 9.2C.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on
the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included. For UL, the scheduling
restriction applies to UL symbols that fully or partially overlap with
the restricted symbols as defined below.

##### 9.2C.7.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on NTN bands above 10 GHz

For UE which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high
layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB\_IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

### 9.2C.8 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps for NTN band above 10 GHz

9.2D NR intra-frequency measurements for ATG
--------------------------------------------

### 9.2D.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified intra-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if

\- the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *intraFreq-needForGap* for
intra-frequency measurement, or

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP\[3\].

For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2D.5.3. SSB
based measurements are configured along with one or two measurement
timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
are to be performed. For intra-frequency connected mode measurements, up
to two measurement window periodicities may be configured. A single
measurement window offset and measurement duration are configured per
intra-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ which start earlier than the gap starting time
+ switching time, nor detect SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which end
later than the gap end -- switching time. Switching time is 0.5 ms for
frequency range FR1.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

### 9.2D.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.2D apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2 for FR1, for
a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7 for FR1, for
a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12 for FR1, for
a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
band.

### 9.2D.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.2D.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 8 identified cells, and

\- 14 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the intra-frequency
layer, where the number of SSBs in the serving cell is not smaller than
the number of configured RLM-RS SSB resources.

### 9.2D.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

#### 9.2D.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodic
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.2.1
(RSRP for FR1), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for FR1) and 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1).

#### 9.2D.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for FR1) and
10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1).

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2D.4.3.

#### 9.2D.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for FR1) and 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR
for FR1).

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ intra\ with\ index~ or
T~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ defined in clause 9.2D.5.1 or clause
9.2D.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.2D.5.1 or clause 9.2D.6.2. If a cell which has been
detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\ intra\ without\ index~ or T~identify\ intra\ with\ index~
defined in clause 9.2D.5.1 or clause 9.2D.6.2 becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again with the
same spatial reception parameter and triggers an event, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap has
not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the
SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3
filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.2D.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.2D.5.1 Intra-frequency cell identification

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell
within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if the UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB
index(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra
frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~. The UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~) ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.2D.5.1-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2D.5.1-3.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.2D.5.2-1.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1D.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully non overlapping or partially overlapping with measurement gaps, or
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1D.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps, i.e. when intra-frequency SMTC is
fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, an SMTC occasion is only considered to be
overlapped by Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions
corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise
the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions corresponds to
the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

When UE supports *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and is configured with
concurrent measurement gaps,

K~p~ is the scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where
N~available~ and N~total~ are calculated as follows:**

\- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP
max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap,
and starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions within the window,
including those overlapped with measurement gap occasions within the
window, and

\- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are not overlapped
with any non-dropped MG occasion within the window W, after accounting
for measurement gap collisions by applying the measurement gap collision
rule in clause 9.1.8.3.

K~p~ = 1 when N~available~ = 0.

> \- Otherwise, when UE is not configured with or UE does not support
> concurrent measurement gaps:
>
> When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement
> gaps or NCSG, or intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs or
> NCSG, K~p~=1

When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. When
intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with NCSG, K~p~ = 1/(1-
(SMTC period /VIRP)), where SMTC period \< VIRP. For calculation of
K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\]) of *smtc2* is
configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List* parameter in *smtc2*,
the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the
value of higher layer parameter *smtc1.* If the higher layer signaling
in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present and *smtc1* is fully
overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is partially overlapping
with measurement gaps, requirements are not specified for
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~

For UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18*,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap are not fully
overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped
by intra-frequency SMTC occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and
*SS-RSSI-Measurement* are configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by
the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement
objects on the same serving carrier which can be merged. and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

> K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.
>
> If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
> measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
> delay would be expected.

Otherwise, K~layer1\_measurement~=1.

#### 9.2D.5.2 Measurement period

The measurement period for intra-frequency measurements without gaps is
as shown in table 9.2D.5.2-1.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2*
is present and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and
*smtc2* is partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are
not specified for T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, an SMTC occasion is only considered to be
overlapped by Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

#### 9.2D.5.3 Scheduling availability of UE during intra-frequency measurements

UE shall be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the SSB
is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When any
of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on
the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

For a UE that supports Pre-MG, the requirements in clause 9.2D.5.3 also
apply when a Pre-MG is deactivated.

##### 9.2D.5.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR1

When the ATG UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled, the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data
symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data
symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC
window duration. If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of
*smtc2* is configured, the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise
SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled, the UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols within SMTC window duration.
If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1.*

When the ATG UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18* performs
intra-frequency neighbouring cell measurements, the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement:

> \- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled, the UE is not expected to
> receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured,
> and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be

> measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer in TS 38.331
> \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured, the SMTC periodicity follows
> smtc2; Otherwise SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1*.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled, the UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within SMTC
window duration. If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of
*smtc2* is configured, the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise
SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1*.

When the ATG UE performs intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled, the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be measured, RSSI measurement
symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB to be
measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB to be
measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled, the UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols within SMTC window duration.
If the high layer signalling of *smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331
\[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc1.*

When the ATG UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18* performs
intra-frequency neighbouring cell measurements, the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement:

> \- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled, the UE is not expected to
> receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured,
> RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive

> duration. If the high layer signaling of *smtc2* is configured in TS
> 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled, the UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within SMTC
window duration. If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of
*smtc2* is configured, the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise
SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1*.

##### 9.2D.5.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*
\[14\] the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR
measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration. If the high layer
signalling of *smtc2* is configured(in TS 38.331 \[2\]), the SMTC
periodicity follows *smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc1.*

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is not enabled the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
all symbols within SMTC window duration. If the high layer signalling of
*smtc2* is configured in TS 38.331 \[2\], the SMTC periodicity follows
*smtc2*; Otherwise the SMTC periodicity follows *smtc1.*

If the following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots

The UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH
CSS set, and/or the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured.

### 9.2D.6 Intra-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

#### 9.2D.6.1 Void

#### 9.2D.6.2 Intra-frequency cell identification

When a measurement gap is provided or an activated Pre-MG is provided
without any pre-MG status changed during the measurement period, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency cell within
T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured), or the UE has been indicated that the neighbour cell is
synchronous with the serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is
enabled). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
intra-frequency cell within T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~ The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_intra\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ ms

T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ = T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_ntra~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ ms

Where:

\- T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.2D.6.2-1.

\- T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2D.6.2-3.

\- T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.2D.6.3-1.

\- CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1D.5.2 for
measurement conducted within measurement gaps.

\- K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

\- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement
gap, and starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other measurement gap occasions
within the window**, and**

\- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap within the
window W after accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the
measurement gap collision rule in clause 9.1.8.3.

When concurrent measurement gaps are configured, requirements in this
clause do not apply if N~available~ =0.

If the higher layer signaling in TS 38.331 \[2\] of *smtc2* is present
and *smtc1* is fully overlapping with measurement gaps and *smtc2* is
partially overlapping with measurement gaps, requirements are not
specified for T~identify\_intra\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index.~

9.3 NR inter-frequency measurements
-----------------------------------

### 9.3.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell or PSCell,
even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities
is provided.

A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps (either legacy measurement gap or NCSG) in
active BWP, for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap* provided that

\- the UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\], and

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.

\- For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps,
UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.9.3.

\- Note: Non-CA capable UE is not expected to indicate support of
*interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\].

Besides the conditions listed above,

\- for UE supporting *nr-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17* and indicating
*NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for inter-frequency measurement,

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement without
gap if

\- the UE indicates 'nogap-noncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

\- For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without MG and NCSG, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.9.4.

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with
NCSG if

\- the UE indicates 'ncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

\- For inter-frequency SSB based measurements with NCSG, UE may cause
scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.10.3.

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap
if

\- the UE indicates 'gap' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

\- for UE supporting *nr-NeedForInterruptionReport-r18* and indicating
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR* for inter-frequency measurement,

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement without
gap if

\- the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *NeedForGapsInfoNR* and the UE
indicates '*no-gap-no-interruption*' or *no-gap-with-interruption* via
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for the inter-frequency measurement, and

\- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

The interruption requirement during inter-frequency measurement without
gap is defined in clause 8.2.2.2.19 when UE indicate
*no-gap-with-interruption*.

No interruption is allowed due to inter-frequency measurement without
gap when following conditions are met:

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or

\- UE indicates "no-gap-no-interruption", or

\- UE indicates "*no-gap-with-interruption*" but inter-frequency SMTC is
partially or fully overlapping with measurement gaps,

During inter-frequency SSB based measurements without gap, UE may cause
scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.9.4.

\- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap
if

\- the UE indicates 'gap' via *NeedForGap-InfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement.

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ on an inter-frequency measurement object which
start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor detect
SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which ends later than the gap end --
switching time. When the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-FR
gap is configured to the UE in EN-DC, SA NR, NE-DC and NR-DC, or the
serving cells are in FR2, the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the
per-UE gap is configured to the UE in SA NR and NR-DC, the switching
time is 0.25 ms. Otherwise the switching time is 0.5 ms.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

Longer measurement period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an NR CGI.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

The measurement requirements defined in clause 9.3 do not apply if the
UE is configured with *needForGapNCSG-ConfigNR-r17* and
*needForInterruptionConfigNR-r18* at the same time.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3.4 and clause
9.3.5 applies for the following scenarios:

> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap.
>
> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement
> gap for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap*, when
>
> \- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap or associated
> measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the
> SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object are
> overlapped with the union of concurrent measurement gaps, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap or associated measurement
> gap in concurrent measurement gaps and the flag
> *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is not configured by the Network.

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the SMTC
occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object are overlapped with
the union of concurrent measurement gaps or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps if MUSIM gaps are configured.

> \- no requirement applies if all of the SMTC occasions of this
> inter-frequency measurement object are overlapped with MUSIM gaps if
> MUSIM gaps are configured.
>
> \- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement
> gap for UE capable of *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18*, when
>
> \- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap or associated
> measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps for the UE indicating
> 'no-gap' via *NeedForGapsInfoNR* and '*no-gap-with-interruption*' or
> '*no-gap-no-interruption*' via *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for the
> inter-frequency measurement, or
>
> \- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped with the measurement gap or associated
> measurement gap in concurrent measurement gaps for the UE indicates
> 'no-gap' via *NeedForGapsInfoNR* and '*no-gap-with-interruption*' via
> *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for the inter-frequency measurement.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3.9 applies for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps, if UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the
flag *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps, if UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the
flag *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps or MUSIM gaps if MUSIM gaps are configured, if UE
supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps or MUSIM gaps if MUSIM gaps are configured, if UE
supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network.

> \- for UE indicating *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18*, when
>
> \- none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
> object are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of
> concurrent measurement gaps for the UE indicates 'no-gap' via
> *NeedForGapsInfoNR* and no-gap-with-interruption or
> no-gap-no-interruption via *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR* for the
> inter-frequency measurement.

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps, for the UE indicates 'no-gap' via *NeedForGapsInfoNR*
and no-gap-no-interruption via *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR* for the
inter-frequency measurement.

\- none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps or MUSIM gaps if MUSIM gaps are configured, for the UE
indicates 'no-gap' via *NeedForGap-InfoNR* and
'*no-gap-with-interruption*' or '*no-gap-no-interruption*' via
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for the inter-frequency measurement.

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps or MUSIM gaps if MUSIM gaps are configured, for the UE
indicates 'no-gap' via *NeedForGap-InfoNR* for the inter-frequency
measurement.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3.10 applies
for the following scenarios:

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap,
when all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement
object are overlapped by the NCSG;

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with NCSG.

### 9.3.2 Requirements applicability

the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 10 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer, and

\- 1 SSB per identified cell.

### 9.3.4 Inter-frequency measurement with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured) or *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is configured for the
FR1 and FR2-1 target frequency layers and UE supporting
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*. Otherwise UE shall be able
to identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency SS block of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

the UE supports capability of conducting such measurements without gaps,
the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and
SS-SINR measurements to higher layers with measurement accuracy as
specified in clauses *10.1.4, 10.1.5, 10.1.9, 10.1.10, 10.1.14 and
10.1.15*, respectively, as shown in table 9.3.5-1 and 9.3.5-2. When
*highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured, and UE supports
*measurementEnhancementInterFreq-r17*,
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ is specified in table 9.3.5-3. When
SCG is deactivated, T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ is specified in
table 9.3.5-4 applies for inter-frequency carrier configured by SCG and
not configured by MCG and table 9.3.5-2 applies for inter-frequency
carrier configured by both SCG and MCG. Regardless of whether the SCG is
activated or deactivated, table 9.3.5-2 applies for an inter-frequency
carrier configured only by MCG.

respectively.*

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This

### 9.3.8 Inter-frequency SFTD measurement requirements

#### 9.3.8.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for a UE supporting NR inter-frequency
SFTD measurement and is applicable in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The UE
shall, depending on network request, perform inter-frequency SFTD
measurement and report SFTD result with or without SS-RSRP. The overall
delay includes RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\] and SFTD measurement reporting delay in clause 9.3.8.3.

UE which fulfils the requirements in clause 9.3.8 is not supposed to
fulfil the requirements defined in clause 9.2.5.4.

#### 9.3.8.2 SFTD Measurement delay

The requirements on SFTD measurement delay defined in this clause are
applicable under the side condition SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -3 dB for the
inter-frequency neighbour cell. Depending on configuration, the SFTD
measurement may be carried out with or without the support of configured
measurement gaps. In the current release, indication on whether to carry
out the SFTD measurement with or without measurement gaps is implicit
and depending on whether measurement gaps are configured.

The UE shall be able to detect, identify and measure SFTD of up to 3 of
the strongest applicable inter-frequency neighbour cells on the carrier
frequency provided in the SFTD measurement configuration. Further
depending on the SFTD measurement configuration, the UE shall
additionally report SS-RSRP for the one or more strongest cells. The UE
may or may not be configured with *cellsForWhichToReportSFTD*. The UE
does not expect *cellsForWhichToReportSFTD* to change during an ongoing
SFTD measurement.

When no measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of
finding the inter-frequency neighbour cell regardless of its SSB
position in the SMTC period, provided that the carrier frequency where
SFTD measurement is configured and the serving carrier(s) form a
supported CA or NR-DC band combination of the UE. The SFTD measurement
shall be conducted with sustained connection to the PCell and activated
SCell(s) in MCG. Depending on capability, the UE may be allowed to cause
a certain amount of interruptions for reconfiguration of the radio
receiver, as specified in clause 8.2.2.2.6.

When measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of finding
the inter-frequency neighbour cell under the additional condition that
the SSB at least occasionally falls within the measurement gap.

When no DRX is used, the UE shall be capable of determining SFTD within
a physical layer measurement period of T~measure\_SFTD1~ as follows:

> \- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and without
> additional SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 14 SMTC periods

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 112 SMTC periods

\- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and without additional
SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 8 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period)

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 64 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period))

\- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and with additional
SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 19 SMTC periods

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = 152 SMTC periods

\- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and with additional
SS-RSRP reporting:

\- For carrier frequency in FR1: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 13 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period)

\- For carrier frequency in FR2: T~measure\_SFTD1~ = CSSF~inter~ × 104 ×
Max(MGRP, SMTC period)

where CSSF~inter~ is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

When DRX is used, the same T~measure\_SFTD1~ as for non-DRX applies, but
the reporting delay depends on the DRX cycle length in use.

In case PCell is changed due to handover, the UE shall terminate the
inter-frequency SFTD measurement.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement shall fulfil the
requirement in clause 10.1.21.3. The measurement accuracy for
additionally reported SS-RSRP shall fulfil the requirement in clauses
10.1.4.1 and 10.1.5.1 for neighbour cell in FR1 and FR2, respectively.

#### 9.3.8.3 SFTD Measurement reporting delay

The SFTD measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between a
command that will trigger an SFTD measurement report and the point when
the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface.
This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty of 2 × TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting
the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE
to send the measurement report.

The SFTD measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~measure\_SFTD1~ defined in clause 9.3.8.2 plus the RRC procedure delay
defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.3.9 Inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.3.9.1 Inter-frequency Cell identification

UE satisfying the applicability conditions specified in clause 9.3.1 on
the requirement in this clause shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured) or *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is configured for the
FR1 and FR2-1 target frequency layers and UE supporting
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*. Otherwise UE shall be able
to identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency SS block of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~.

\- For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps
in active BWP, it is assumed that when UE performs inter-frequency
measurements without measurement gaps in a TDD bands on FR1 and FR2, SFN
and frame boundary across serving cell and inter-frequency neighbor
cells is aligned

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

When UE supports *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or *musim-GapPreference-r17* or
both concurrent measurement GAP and *musim-GapPreference-r17* and the UE
is configured with concurrent GAPs or periodic MUSIM gaps or both
concurrent gaps and periodic MUSIM gaps,

K~p~ is a scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured
without GAP. K~p~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and
N~total~ are calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ xRP\_max), where xRP\_max
is the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE GAPs, periodic MUSIM
gaps, and per-FR GAPs within the same FR as the SSB frequency layer, and
starting at the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions within the window,
including those overlapped with GAP and MUSIM gap occasions within the
window, and

N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are not overlapped
with any non-dropped GAP or non-dropped MUSIM gap occasions within the
window W, after accounting for GAP and MUSIM gap collisions by applying
the collision rules for the measurement GAP and MUSIM gap in clauses
9.1.8.3, 9.1.10.4 and 9.1.10.5, respectively.

**- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG**, also xRP = MGRP for periodic MUSIM
gap**.**

K~p~ = 1 when N~available~ = 0.

Requirements in this clause do not apply when N~available~ = 0 due to
fully overlapping between SMTC occasions and MUSIM gap occasions within
the window W.

Editor Note: FSS for the case when N~available~ = 0 due to fully
overlapping between SMTC occasions and the union of MUSIM gap and
measurement gap occasions within the window W.

When UE supports \[***musim-GapPreference-r17**\]* and the SMTC
occasions of the target frequency layer is fully or partially
overlapping with the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap, longer cell
identification period for the target frequency layer is expected.

Otherwise, when UE is not configured with or UE does not support
concurrent GAPs and the UE is not configured with MUSIM gaps:

When inter-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or NCSG, or interfrequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs or NCSG,
K~p~ =1.

When inter-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. When
inter-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with NCSG, K~p~ = 1/(1-
(SMTC period /VIRP)), where SMTC period \< VIRP.

For FR2,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and *SS-RSSI-Measurement* are
configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

For calculation of K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\])
of *smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List*
parameter in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC
periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1.*

#### 9.3.9.3 Scheduling availability of UE during inter-frequency measurements when the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE is
required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the
SSB is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When
any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*
\[2\], if it is configured; otherwise, all L SSB symbols within the SMTC
window duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

The scheduling availability requirements when UE performs
inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps in a TDD bands on
FR1 and FR2 in clause 9.3.9.3.1\~9.3.9.3.3 are valid under the following
conditions:

> \- SFN and frame boundary across serving cell and inter-frequency
> neighbor cells is aligned

\[For UE supporting MUSIM gaps, when MUSIM gaps are configured, the
requirements in clause 9.3.9.3 are also applied to the slots that are
not interrupted according to requirements in clause 9.1.10.x3.y2 and
9.1.10.x3.y3.\]

##### 9.3.9.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a TDD band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or
SS-SINR measurement

\- UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be
measured, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be
measured within SMTC window duration.

When UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a TDD band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ
measurement

\- UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be
measured, RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each
consecutive SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration.

When TDD intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to one serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions due to one serving cell also apply to all other
serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially
overlap with aforementioned restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided

##### 9.3.9.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology-Inter-r16* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a TDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1
data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within
SMTC window duration.

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a FDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on the union of restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of all MOs, where the restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of MO *i* include

> \- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to
> be measured on MO i, and △t serving cell symbol before each
> consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and △t serving cell symbol
> after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC window
> duration, if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled for MO i
> and UE supporting *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*. △t is
> defined as the minimum integer number of symbols with total duration
> no smaller than the tolerance specified in clause 7.9, or

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SMTC window for
MO i and on 1 serving cell symbol before and after the SMTC window, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled for MO i, or UE not

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all
other serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with aforementioned restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

##### 9.3.9.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR
measurement on an FR2 inter-frequency cell

The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1
data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within
SMTC window duration.

The following scheduling restriction applies to SS-RSRQ measurement on
an FR2 inter-frequency cell

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, RSSI
measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration*.*

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

If following conditions are met:

\- The UE has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between the UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type 2-PDCCH CSS set that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots.

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, the
UE shall receive the PDCCH that the UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS
set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, the
UE shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that the UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured.

##### 9.3.9.3.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR2 serving cell frequency layer.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR1 serving cell frequency layer.

measurement, or if UE supports *nr-NeedForInterruptionReport-r18* and
indicates *nogap* in *NeedforGap-InfoNR* and further indicates
*no-gap-no-interruption* or *no-gap-with-interruption* via
*NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* for inter-frequency measurement*,* UE is
required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the
SSB is not completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE.
When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols indicated by the union
set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement objects on
the same serving carrier which can be merged \[2\], if it is configured;
otherwise, all *L* SSB symbols within the SMTC window duration defined
in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

The requirements in clause 9.3.9.4 based on
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell-inter* apply provided that UE supports
ncsg-*SymbolLevelScheduleRestrictionInter-r17*. If UE does not support
*ncsg-SymbolLevelScheduleRestrictionInter-r17*, the requirements in
clause 9.3.9.4.3 apply assuming *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell-inter* is not
enabled.

##### 9.3.9.4.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When the UE performs inter-frequency measurements without MG and NCSG in
a TDD band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR

monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured.

##### 9.3.9.4.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR2 frequency layer.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
measurements performed on FR1 frequency layer.

### 9.3.10 Inter-frequency measurement with NCSG

#### 9.3.10.1 Inter-frequency cell identification

For the UE supporting NCSG, if NCSG is provided, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured) or *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is configured.
Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency
cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3.10.1-1 and table 9.3.10.1-2.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3.10.1-3 and table
9.3.10.1-4.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.3.10.2-1 and table 9.3.10.2-2.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or 5,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter~ = 64 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting
FR2 power class 4, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter~ = 40 samples.

M~SSB\_index\_inter~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or 5,
M~SSB\_index\_inter~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power class
2, M~SSB\_index\_inter~ = 24 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 3, M~SSB\_index\_inter~ = 24 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 4, M~SSB\_index\_inter~ = 24 samples.

M~meas\_period\_inter~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or 5,
M~meas\_period\_inter~ =64 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power class
2, M~meas\_period\_inter~=40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 3, M~meas\_period\_inter~ =40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 4, M~meas\_period\_inter~ = 40 samples.

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ in clause 9.1.5.3 for measurement
conducted within NCSG.

\- K~NCSG~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be
measured within an associated NCSG pattern. K~NCSG~ **= 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent GAPs. Otherwise,** K~NCSG~ =
**N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

\- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ xRP\_max), where
xRP\_max is the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE GAPs and per-FR
GAPs within the same FR as the SSB frequency layer, and starting from
the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated NCSG **within the window W,** including
**those overlapped** with other GAP occasions within the window**, and**

**- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated NCSG **within the window W after
accounting for GAP collisions by applying the GAP collision rule in
clauses 9.1.8.3, 9.1.12.3, and 9.1.13.3.**

**- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.**

\- When concurrent GAPs are configured, requirements in this clause do
not apply if N~available~ =0.

9.3A NR inter-frequency measurements in carrier frequencies with CCA
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.3A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.3A apply for inter-frequency measurements
on a carrier frequency with CCA. A measurement is defined as an SSB
based inter-frequency measurement provided it is not defined as an
intra-frequency measurement according to clause 9.2A.The UE shall be
able to identify new inter-frequency cells in carrier frequencies with
CCA and perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified
inter-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell or PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer
cell identities is provided.

When the inter-frequency measurement is performed on a neighbour cell in
FR2-2 with shared spectrum channel access, UE shall determine the CCA
mode of the neighbour cell according to *channelAccessMode2-r17*of the
cell configured in *MeasObjectNR*. If *channelAccessMode2-r17* of the
cell is enabled, UE shall assume that CCA applies to the cell and
perform measurement accordingly, and the requirements in clause 9.3A
shall apply; otherwise, UE shall assume that CCA does not apply to the
cell and perform measurement accordingly, and requirements in clause 9.3
shall apply.

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than the
gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which end later than
the gap end -- switching time.

In the requirements of clause 9.3A, the term SMTC occasion not available
at the UE refers to when the SMTC contains SSBs configured by gNB in a
cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but N candidate SSB
positions for the same SS/PBCH block index within the discovery burst
transmission window are not available at the UE due to DL CCA failures
at gNB during the corresponding evaluation or measurement period, where:

\- For the cell detection procedure: N is at least one candidate SSB
position (NOTE: the one candidate SSB position for the cell detection
shall not be impacted by the set of candidate SSB positions which are
already being measured by the UE within the current measurement period
of the on-going measurements), and

\- For other procedures in clause 9.3A: N are the first two successive
candidate SSB positions when two or more candidate SSB positions are
configured for this SSB index in one discovery burst transmission
window, otherwise N is one candidate SSB position;

otherwise the SMTC occasion is considered as available at the UE.

For the FR2-2 requirements of clause 9.3A, an SMTC occasion group
consists of N consecutive SMTC occasions. An SMTC occasion group is not
available, when at least one SMTC occasion in the group is not
transmitted by the gNB.

### 9.3A.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3A apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency CCA cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.28,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clause 10.1.30 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clause 10.1.32 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.9.

### 9.3A.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.3A.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB indexes and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

#### 9.3A.3.2 Requirements for FR2-2

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 10 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer, and

\- 1 SSB per identified cell.

### 9.3A.4 Inter-frequency cell identification

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report
SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell, in carrier frequencies with CCA, within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to identify a
new detectable inter-frequency SS block, in carrier frequencies with
CCA, of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~
+ ~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3A.4-1 and table 9.3A.4-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_cca~: it is the time period used to acquire
the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3A.4-2 and table
9.3A.4-4.

> T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~: equal to a measurement period
> of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3A.5-1.

CSSF~inter~ : it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\ CCA~ = 96. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
2, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 3, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\ CCA~ = 60.

M~SSB\_index\_inter\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 2 or 3,
M~SSB\_index\_inter\ CCA~ = 48 samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 1, M~SSB\_index\_inter\ CCA~ = 72 samples

M~meas\_period\_inter\_CCA~: For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class 1,
M~meas\_period\_inter\ CCA~ = 96. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power class
2, M~meas\_period\_inter\ CCA~ = 60. For a UE supporting FR2-2 power
class 3, M~meas\_period\_inter\ CCA~ = 60

The UE shall restart the measurement upon exceeding L~meas,gap,max~. The
requirements apply provided that any two closest SMTC occasions
available at the UE for the measurement shall be separated by no more
than the maximum time requirement for the cell to remain known.

### 9.3A.6 Inter-frequency measurements reporting requirements

#### 9.3A.6.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.28, 10.1.30, and 10.1.32, respectively.

#### 9.3A.6.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.28, 10.1.30, and 10.1.32, respectively.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3A.6.3.

#### 9.3A.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.28, 10.1.30, and 10.1.32, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report, and all delays due to
UL CCA failures until the successful transmission of the report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be within T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ if UE
is not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the
associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~. Both
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_without\_index~ and
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~ are defined in clause 9.3A.4.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSB measured from the cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.3A.4. If a
cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_inter\_cca\ \_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.3A.4 becomes
undetectable for a period ≤ 8 seconds and then the cell becomes
detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and then
triggers the measurement report as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca~ defined in clause 9.3A.5
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ±
3200/$2^{µ}$ Tc while measurement gap has not been available and the L3
filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as
defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3 filtering is used an
additional delay can be expected.

### 9.3A.8 Inter-frequency RSSI measurements

An RSSI measurement is defined as an inter-frequency measurement
provided that the RSSI measurement bandwidth is not contained within the
current carrier bandwidth of the UE.

The UE physical layer shall be capable of performing the RSSI
measurements, defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] on one or more inter-frequency
carriers operating with CCA, TS 37.213 \[33\], if the carrier(s) are
indicated by higher layers \[2\], and report the RSSI measurements to
higher layers. The UE physical layer shall provide to higher layers a
single RSSI sample for each OFDM symbol within each configured RSSI
measurement duration \[2\] occurring with a configured RSSI measurement
timing configuration periodicity \[2\], *rmtc-Periodicity*. The
requirements apply if *rmtc-SubframeOffset* \[2\] is configured.

For performing inter-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2,

\- If a UE has serving cell in FR2-2,

\- If the TCI state is provided in RMTC configuration of FR2-2, the UE
shall assume the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with
TypeD to the DL RS associated with the TCI state provided in the RMTC
configuration. The UE does not expect to be configured with an explicit
TCI-state in RMTC-Config with a reference serving cell in FR1 or FR2-1.
If no TCI state is provided in the RMTC configuration, the UE shall
assume the configured RSSI measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD
to one of the latest received PDSCH and the latest monitored CORESET in
the active BWP of a serving carrier in FR2-2.

\- If a UE has no serving cell in FR2-2,

\- The UE does not expect that a TCI state is provided in RMTC
configuration. It is up to UE implementation how to determine the
spatial domain filter for the inter-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2,
and no requirements are defined.

For RSSI measurement in FR2-2 with SCS of 480 kHz or 960 kHz, the RSSI
measurement results shall be derived based on symbols configured by RMTC
except for the first symbol and the last symbol in RMTC, and there is no
requirements when *measDurationSymbols* is configured as 1.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency
measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent inter-frequency measurements, including inter-frequency RSSI
measurements. The RSSI measurement duration and the measurement gap
shall be aligned, and the following additional condition shall be
fulfilled:

\- Entire RSSI measurement duration is contained in the measurement gap.

The RSSI measurement performed and reported according to this clause
shall meet the RSSI measurement accuracy requirement in clause
10.1.34.2. The reported RSSI measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1.34.3.

### 9.3A.9 Inter-frequency channel occupancy measurements

The UE shall be capable of estimating the channel occupancy on one or
more carrier frequencies indicated by higher layers \[2\], based on RSSI
samples provided by the physical layer. The requirements apply if
*rmtc-SubframeOffset* \[2\] is configured.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency
measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent inter-frequency measurements, including inter-frequency
channel occupancy measurements. The RSSI measurement duration used for
channel occupancy measurement and the measurement gap shall be aligned,
and the following additional condition shall be fulfilled:

\- Entire RSSI measurement duration is contained in the measurement gap.

The channel occupancy measurement performed and reported according to
this clause shall meet the channel occupancy measurement accuracy
requirements in clause 10.1.35.2. The reported channel occupancy
measurement values contained in measurement reports shall be based on
the measurement reporting range specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

9.3B NR inter-frequency measurements for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------

### 9.3B.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2B.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap*
provided

\- the UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\], and

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.

For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3B.7.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than the
gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which ends later than
the gap end -- switching time. When the serving cells are in FR2, the
inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-UE gap or per-FR gap is
configured to the UE in SA NR, the switching time is 0.25 ms. Otherwise
the switching time is 0.5 ms.

Longer measurement period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI\_RedCap~ when the UE is requested to decode an NR/E-UTRA
CGI.

### 9.3B.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3B apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4 and 10.1.5
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9 and 10.1.10
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14 and 10.1.15
for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
band.

\- For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.4 for FR1 for
a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.8 for FR1 for
a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1A.12 for FR1,
respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.16 for a corresponding
band.

### 9.3B.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.3B.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

#### 9.3B.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 10 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer, and

\- 1 SSB per identified cell.

### 9.3B.4 Inter-frequency measurement with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~. The
UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency SS block
of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3B.4-1, table 9.3B.4-2, table 9.3B.4-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used to
acquire the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3B.4-4,
table 9.3B.4-5, table 9.3B.4-6.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: equal to a measurement
period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3B.5-1, table 9.3B.5-2,
table 9.3B.5-3.

For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1
or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 64 samples. For a UE supporting
FR2 power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40
samples.

M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3,4 or 7, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 24 samples.

M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =64 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =40 samples.

CSSF~inter\_RedCap~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in clause 9.1A.5.2
for measurement conducted within measurement gaps.

10.1.14.1 and 10.1.15.1, respectively.*

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses* 10.1A.4.1, 10.1A.8.1 and 10.1A.12.1*,
respectively.*

*The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3B.6.3.*

#### 9.3B.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.1.4.1, 10.1.5.1, 10.1.9.1, 10.1.10.1,
10.1.14.1 and 10.1.15.1, respectively.*

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: *Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements
contained in event triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses* 10.1A.4.1, 10.1A.8.1 and 10.1A.12.1*,
respectively.*

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.*

*The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be* within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_\ RedCap~
if UE is not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with
the associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_\ RedCap~. *Both*
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_\ RedCap~ *and*
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_\ RedCap~ *are defined in clause 9.3B.4.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.*

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_\ RedCap~ or
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_\ RedCap~ as defined in clause 9.3B.4 or
9.3B.7.1. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify\ inter\ without\ index\_\ RedCap~ or
T~identify\ inter\ with\ index\_\ RedCap~ defined in clause 9.3B.4 or
9.3B.7.1 becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell
becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and
triggers an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_\ RedCap~ provided the
timing to that cell has not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while
the measurement gap has not been available and L3 filtering has not been
used, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS
38.211 \[3\]. When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be
expected.

### 9.3B.7 Inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.3B.7.1 Inter-frequency Cell identification

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ if UE is not indicated to
report SSB based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~. The
UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency SS block
of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~. It is assumed that when UE
performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps in a TDD
bands on FR1 and FR2, the following conditions are met:

\- SFN and frame boundary across serving cell and inter-frequency
neighbor cells is aligned, and

\- the timing of SSBs across serving cell and inter-frequency neighbor
cells are aligned

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index\_RedCap~ =
(T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ +
T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3B.7.1-1, table 9.3B.7.1-2 and table
9.3B.7.1-3.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: it is the time period used to
acquire the index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3B.7.1-4
and table 9.3B.7.1-5.

> T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: equal to a measurement
> period of SSB based measurement given in table 9.3B.7.2-1, table
> 9.3B.7.2-2 and table 9.3B.7.2-3.

CSSF~inter\_RedCap~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~outside\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in clause 9.1A.5.1
for measurement conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when
inter-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping or partially overlapping
with measurement gaps or according to CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ in
clause 9.1A.5.2 for measurement conducted within measurement gaps, i.e.
when inter-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1
or 5, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting
FR2 power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter\_RedCap~ = 24
samples.

M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~SSB\_index\_inter\_RedCap~ = 24 samples.

M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or
5, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =40 samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 2, 3, 4 or 7, M~meas\_period\_inter\_RedCap~ =24 samples.

When inter-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement gaps
or inter-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, K~p~=1.

When inter-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP.

For FR2,

K~layer1\_measurement~ =1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and *SS-RSSI-Measurement* are
configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*
\[2\], if it is configured; otherwise, all L SSB symbols within the SMTC
window duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

The scheduling availability requirements when UE performs
inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps in a TDD bands on
FR1 and FR2 and HD-FDD UE performs inter-frequency measurements without

neighbor cells is aligned, and

\- the timing of SSBs across serving cell and inter-frequency neighbor
cells are aligned

##### 9.3B.7.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

##### 9.3B.7.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR
measurement on an FR2 inter-frequency cell

The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1

9.3C NR inter-frequency measurements for SAN
--------------------------------------------

### 9.3C.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2C. The requirements apply provided the valid parameters of
ephemeris information, epoch time of the ephemeris, common TA, validity
timer information, downlink polarization information for target NR SAN
cell are send to UE.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

A measurement is defined as inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap*
provided

\- the UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\], and

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, and

\- the flag *interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the
Network.

For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3C.5.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with one or more measurement
timing configurations (SMTC) which provides periodicity, duration and
offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements on
the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, the measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is not configured, one measurement window
periodicity will be configured with *SSB-MTC*

\- when *SSB-MTC4List-r17* is configured, multiple measurement window
offsets may be configured with *SSB-MTC* and *SSB-MTC4List-r17*, and the
requirements in 9.3C apply provided that the total number of measurement
window offsets does not exceed the UE capability *parallelSMTC-r17*

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than the
gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which ends later than
the gap end -- switching time, and the switching time is 0.5 ms.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3C.4 and clause
9.3C.5 apply for the following scenarios:

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object with measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement object without measurement gap
when

\- all of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped with the measurement gap or associated measurement gap in
concurrent measurement gaps, or

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped with the associated measurement gap and all the SMTC
occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object are overlapped with
the union of concurrent measurement gaps, or

\- part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or associated measurement gap in
concurrent measurement gaps.

The inter-frequency measurement requirements in clause 9.3C.7 apply for
the following scenarios:

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
none of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gap.

\- SSB-based inter-frequency measurement with no measurement gap, when
part of the SMTC occasions of this inter-frequency measurement object
are overlapped by the measurement gap or the union of concurrent
measurement gaps.

The requirements in clause 9.3C.8, 9.3C.9 and 9.3C.10 apply provided
that the measured NR SAN cell is served by the same satellite as the
serving cell.

### 9.3C.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3C apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4C for FR1 and
10.1.5C for FR2-NTN, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9C for FR1 and
10.1.10C for FR2-NTN, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14C for FR1 and
10.1.15C for FR2-NTN, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.18 for a corresponding
band.

### 9.3C.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.3C.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

\- 4 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI from neighbour cells in
GEO deployment.

\- In NGSO deployments: cells from 2 satellites if UE does not support
the capability *maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*; or cells from
3 or 4 satellites depending on the value indicated in
*maxNumber-NGSO-SatellitesPerCarrier-r17*.

### 9.3C.4 Inter-frequency measurement with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3C.4-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3C.4-2.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.3C.5-1.

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps.** When the UE is
**configured with concurrent measurement gaps and the two measurement
gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP=160 ms, K~gap~ = 2. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement
gap, and starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other measurement gap occasions
within the window**, and**

**- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap **within the
window W after accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the
measurement gap collision rule in clause 9.1.8C.3.**

K~gap~ **is only applicable for UE supporting**
*parallelMeasurementGap-r17***.** When concurrent measurement gaps are
configured, requirements in this clause do not apply if N~available~ =0,
or if one SMTC overlaps more than one MGs associated to the frequency
layer.

K\_satellite: it is a satellite specific scaling factor.

\- If SMTCs within a measurement gap do not overlap with each other, and
if LEO and/or GEO satellite(s) is/are required to be measured within
SMTC

\- K\_satellite = 1, if GSO satellites are measured on the carrier

\-
$K\_ satellite = \left\lceil \frac{\text{Num}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{to}\ \text{be}\ \text{measured}\ \text{in}\ \text{the}\ \text{SMTC}}{\text{number}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{UE}\ \text{is}\ \text{capable}\ \text{to}\ \text{measure}\ \text{in}\ \text{one}\ \text{SMTC}} \right\rceil$,
if LEO satellites are measured on the carrier.

\- If SMTCs within a measurement gap partially overlap with each other,
and if LEO and/or GEO satellite(s) is/are required to be measured within
overlapped SMTCs

\-
$K\_ satellite = \text{number}\ \text{of}\ \text{overlapped}\ \text{SMTCs}$,
if only GEO satellites are measured on the carrier

\-
$K\_ satellite = \sum_{i}^{}\left\lceil \frac{\text{Num}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{to}\ \text{be}\ \text{measured}\ \text{in}\ \text{the}\ \text{SMTC}\ i}{\text{number}\ \text{of}\ \text{LEO}\ \text{satellites}\ \text{UE}\ \text{is}\ \text{capable}\ \text{to}\ \text{measure}\ \text{in}\ \text{one}\ \text{SMTC}} \right\rceil$,
if only LEO satellites are measured on the carrier.

The UE is allowed to skip measurements on inter-frequency cells, in the
interval between *t-serviceStart* and the satellite switch completion,
when it is performing soft satellite switching with resynchronization.
In this case, for the measurement initiated but not completed before the
beginning of this interval, the total time to detection can be longer.

### 9.3C.5 Inter-frequency measurements

When measurement gaps are provided for inter-frequency measurements, or
the UE supports capability of conducting such measurements without gaps,
the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and
SS-SINR measurements to higher layers with measurement accuracy as
specified in clauses 10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C , respectively, as
shown in table 9.3C.5-1.

The UE is allowed to skip measurements on inter-frequency cells, in the
interval between *t-serviceStart* and the satellite switch completion,
when it is performing soft satellite switching with resynchronization.
In this case, for the measurement initiated but not completed before
this interval, the total time to measure can be longer.

### 9.3C.6 Inter-frequency measurements reporting requirements

#### 9.3C.6.1 Periodic Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses* 10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C*, respectively.*

#### 9.3C.6.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses* 10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C*, respectively.*

*The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3C.6.3.*

#### 9.3C.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses*
10.1.4C, 10.1.9C *and* 10.1.14C*, respectively.*

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.*

*The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be* within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is
not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the
associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~.
*Both* T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ *and*
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ *are defined in clause 9.3C.4. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.*

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSB measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.3C.4 or clause 9.3C.7. If a cell which has been
detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~
defined in clause 9.3C.4 or clause 9.3C.7 becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again with the
same spatial reception parameter and triggers an event, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap has
not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the
SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3
filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.3C.7 Inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.3C.7.1 Inter-frequency Cell identification

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~.

> T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +

>
> T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3C.7.1-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3C.7.1-2.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.3C.7.2-1.

> CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined

K~p~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = N~total\_SAN~ / N~available\_SAN~,
where N~available\_SAN~ and N~total\_SAN~ are calculated as follows:

> \- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where

#### 9.3C.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE during inter-frequency measurements

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE is
required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the
SSB is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When
any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*
\[2\], if it is configured; otherwise, all L SSB symbols within the SMTC
window duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.
For UL, the scheduling restriction applies to UL symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the restricted symbols as defined below.

##### 9.3C.7.3.1 Void

##### 9.3C.7.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology-Inter-r16* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a FDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within SMTC window
duration.

### 9.3C.8 Inter-frequency measurement with measurement gaps for NTN band above 10 GHz

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3C.8-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3C.8-2.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.3C.9-1.

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

K~gap~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps.** When the UE is
**configured with concurrent measurement gaps and the two measurement
gaps are fully overlapping with MGRP=160 ms, K~gap~ = 2. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gap, and
starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including **those overlapped** with other measurement gap occasions
within the window**, and**

**- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap **within the
window W after accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the
measurement gap collision rule in clause 9.1.8.3.**

K~gap~ **is only applicable for UE supporting**
*parallelMeasurementGap-r17***.** When concurrent measurement gaps are
configured, requirements in this clause do not apply if N~available~ =0,
or if one SMTC overlaps more than one MGs associated to the frequency
layer.

### 9.3C.10 Inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps for NTN band above 10 GHz

#### 9.3C.10.1 Inter-frequency Cell identification

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured). Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable inter frequency SS block of
an already detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~.

> T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
> T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms
>
> T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
> T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection
given in table 9.3C.10.1-1.

T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3C.10.1-2.

T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of SSB
based measurement given in table 9.3C.10.2-1.

K~p~ is the scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = N~total\_SAN~ / N~available\_SAN~,
where N~available\_SAN~ and N~total\_SAN~ are calculated as follows:

> \- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where

#### 9.3C.10.3 Scheduling availability of UE during inter-frequency measurements

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE is
required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the
SSB is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When
any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*
\[2\], if it is configured; otherwise, all L SSB symbols within the SMTC
window duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.
For UL, the scheduling restriction applies to UL symbols that fully or
partially overlap with the restricted symbols as defined below.

##### 9.3C.10.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on NTN bands above 10 GHz

For UE which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology-Inter-r16* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a TDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1
data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within
SMTC window duration.

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps
in a FDD band, UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within SMTC window
duration.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

9.3D NR inter-frequency measurements for ATG
--------------------------------------------

### 9.3D.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2D.

The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and perform
SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by PCell, even if no
explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps for UE capable of *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap*
provided

\- the UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16* \[15\], and

\- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.

For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps, UE
may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3D.9.3.

SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5 ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement object.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect SSB
and measure RSSI of RSRQ on an inter-frequency measurement object which
start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor detect
SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which ends later than the gap end --
switching time. The switching time is 0.5 ms.

The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.

Longer measurement period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an NR CGI.

### 9.3D.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.3D apply, provided:

\- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4 for FR1, for
a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9 for FR1, for
a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14 for FR1, for
a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
band.

### 9.3D.3 Number of cells and number of SSB

#### 9.3D.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency layer, during each layer 1 measurement period,
the UE shall be capable of performing SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR
measurements for at least:

\- 4 identified cells, and

\- 7 SSBs with different SSB index and/or PCI on the inter-frequency
layer.

### 9.3D.4 Inter-frequency measurement with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured) or *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is configured for the
FR1 target frequency layers and UE supporting
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*. Otherwise UE shall be able
to identify a new detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency SS block of an already detected cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index.~

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

> T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
> detection given in table 9.3D.4-1.
>
> T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
> index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3D.4-2.
>
> T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of
> SSB based measurement given in table 9.3D.5-1.

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1D.5.2 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

K~gap~ is a scaling factor for a SSB frequency layer to be measured
within an associated measurement gap pattern. **K~gap~ = 1** when the UE
is not **configured with concurrent measurement gaps. Otherwise,**
K~gap~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
calculated as follows:**

\- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement
gap(s), and starting from the beginning of any SMTC occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions** that are covered by
instances of the associated measurement gap **within the window W,**
including those overlapped with other measurement gap occasions within
the window**, and**

\- N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are covered by
instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap within the
window W, after accounting for collisions between the measurement gaps
by applying the measurement gap collision rule in clause 9.1.8.3.

K~gap~ **is only applicable for UE supporting**
*concurrentMeasGap-r17***.** When concurrent measurement gaps are
configured, requirements in this clause do not apply if N~available~ =0.

### 9.3D.6 Inter-frequency measurements reporting requirements

#### 9.3D.6.1 Periodic Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.1, 10.1.9.1, and 10.1.14.1, respectively.*

#### 9.3D.6.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.4.1, 10.1.9.1, and 10.1.14.1, respectively.*

*The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.3D.6.3.*

#### 9.3D.6.3 Event-triggered Reporting

*Reported SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.4.1, 10.1.9.1, and 10.1.14.1, respectively.*

*The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.*

*The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2* × *TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.*

*The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be* within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is
not indicated to report SSB based RRM measurement result with the
associated SSB index. Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~.
*Both* T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ *and*
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ *are defined in clause 9.3D.4. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.*

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ as
defined in clause 9.3D.4 or clause 9.3D.9.1. If a cell which has been
detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\ inter\ without\ index~ or T~identify\ inter\ with\ index~
defined in clause 9.3D.4 or clause 9.3D.9.1 becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again with the
same spatial reception parameter and triggers an event, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than ± 3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~ while the measurement gap has
not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where *µ* is the
SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3
filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

### 9.3D.7 Void

### 9.3D.8 Void

### 9.3D.9 Inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.3D.9.1 Inter-frequency Cell identification

UE satisfying the applicability conditions specified in clause 9.3D.1 on
the requirement in this clause shall be able to identify a new
detectable inter-frequency cell within
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ if UE is not indicated to report SSB
based RRM measurement result with the associated SSB index
(*reportQuantityRsIndexes* or *maxNrofRSIndexesToReport* is not
configured) or *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is configured for the
FR1 and UE supporting *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*.
Otherwise UE shall be able to identify a new detectable inter-frequency
cell within T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~. The UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable inter-frequency SS block of an already
detected cell within T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~.

T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~) ms

T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ +
T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~) ms

Where:

\- T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~: it is the time period used in PSS/SSS
detection given in table 9.3D.9.1-1.

\- T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~: it is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3D.9.1-3.

\- T~SSB\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of
SSB based measurement given in table 9.3D.9.2-1.

\- CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is
determined according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1D.5.1 for
measurement conducted outside measurement gaps, i.e. when
inter-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping or partially overlapping
with measurement gaps or according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause
9.1D.5.2 for measurement conducted within measurement gaps, i.e. when
inter-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with measurement gaps.

For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps in
active BWP.

M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter~: For FR1, M~pss/sss\_sync\_inter~ = 5.

M~SSB\_index\_inter~: For FR1, M~SSB\_index\_inter~ = 3.

M~meas\_period\_inter~: For FR1, M~meas\_period\_inter~ = 5.

K~p~ is a scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be measured
without measurement gaps. K~p~ = **N~total~ / N~available~, where
N~available~ and N~total~ are calculated as follows:**

For a window W of duration max(SMTC period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG, and starting at the
beginning of any SMTC occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of SMTC occasions within the window,
including those overlapped with MG occasions within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of SMTC occasions that are not overlapped
with any non-dropped MG occasion within the window W, after accounting
for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision rule provided
that concurrent measurement gaps are configured.

K~p~ = 1 when N~available~ = 0.

Otherwise, when UE is not configured with or UE does not support
concurrent measurement gaps:

> When inter-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement
> gaps, or inter-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs, K~p~ =1.

When inter-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, K~p~ = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period \< MGRP. When
inter-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with NCSG, K~p~ = 1/(1-
(SMTC period /VIRP)), where SMTC period \< VIRP.

For UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18*,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap are not fully
overlapped by inter-frequency SMTC occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped
by inter-frequency SMTC occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and
*SS-RSSI-Measurement* are configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by
the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement
objects on the same serving carrier which can be merged. and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

> K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

Otherwise, K~layer1\_measurement~=1.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

For calculation of K~p~, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 \[2\])
of *smtc2* is configured, for cells indicated in the *pci-List*
parameter in *smtc2*, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc2*; for the other cells, the SMTC
periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter *smtc1.*

#### 9.3D.9.3 Scheduling availability of UE during inter-frequency measurements

If UE supports *interFrequencyMeas-NoGap-r16* and the flag
*interFrequencyConfig-NoGap-r16* is configured by the Network, UE is
required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when the
SSB is completely contained in the active bandwidth part of the UE. When
any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction. Note that the SSB symbols to be measured in the
following clauses are the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*
\[2\], if it is configured; otherwise, all L SSB symbols within the SMTC
window duration defined in clause 4.1 of TS 38.213 \[3\] are included.

##### 9.3D.9.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements in TDD bands on FR1

When ATG UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement
gaps in a TDD band, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP or
SS-SINR measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled, UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be measured, and on 1 data
symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured and 1 data
symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC
window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled, UE is not
expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols within SMTC window
duration.

When ATG UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18* performs inter-frequency
measurements without measurement gaps, the following restrictions apply
due to SS-RSRP or SS-SINR measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled, UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured,
and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured
and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols to be measured
within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled, UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within
SMTC window duration.

When ATG UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement
gaps, the following restrictions apply due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled, UE is not expected
to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on SSB symbols to be measured, RSSI
measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB to
be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled, UE is not
expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols within SMTC window
duration.

When ATG UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18* performs inter-frequency
measurements without measurement gaps, the following restrictions apply
due to SS-RSRQ measurement

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled, UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be measured,
RSSI measurement symbols, and on 1 data symbol before each consecutive
SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols and 1 data symbol after each consecutive
SSB to be measured/RSSI symbols within SMTC window duration.

\- If *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled, UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within
SMTC window duration.

##### 9.3D.9.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UE which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology-Inter-r16* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to SS-RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- If UE performs inter-frequency measurements without measurement gaps,
UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on the union of restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of all MOs, where the restricted serving cell
symbols due to measurement of MO *i* include

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SSB symbols to
be measured on MO i, and △t serving cell symbol before each consecutive
SSB symbols to be measured and △t serving cell symbol after each
consecutive SSB symbols to be measured within SMTC window duration, if
deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17 is enabled for MO i and UE supporting
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*. △t is defined as the minimum
integer number of symbols with total duration no smaller than the
tolerance specified in clause 7.9D, or

\- serving cell symbols fully or partially overlap with SMTC window for
MO i and on 1 serving cell symbol before and after the SMTC window, if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is not enabled for MO i, or UE not
supporting *deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInterNon-NCSG-r17*.

9.4 Inter-RAT measurements
--------------------------

### 9.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are specified for NR−E-UTRAN FDD and
NR−E-UTRAN TDD measurements and are applicable without an explicit
E-UTRAN neighbour cell list containing physical layer cell identities,
for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured

\- with SA or NR-DC operation mode or configured in NE-DC operation mode
by PCell with NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR,
RSTD, or E-CID RSRP and RSRQ) on E-UTRA non-serving frequency carrier,
or

\- with SA operation mode on NR carrier frequencies with CCA by PCell
with NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR) on E-UTRA
non-serving frequency carrier, and

\- configured with an appropriate measurement gap pattern according to
table 9.1.2-3.

The requirements in this clause for concurrent measurement gaps are only
applied for UE in NR SA operation mode.

For UE supporting *eutra-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17* and indicating
*NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for inter-RAT measurement,

\- An inter-RAT measurement is defined as measurement without gap if

\- the UE indicates 'nogap-noncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for
the inter-RAT measurement

\- for UE support FG 32-4, the inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurements without
gaps requirements are specified in clause 9.4.8.

\- An inter-RAT measurement is defined as measurement with NCSG if

\- the UE indicates 'ncsg' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for the
inter-RAT measurement

When network configures measurement gap or NCSG, the delay requirements
are specified in clause 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

\- An inter-RAT SSB measurement is defined as measurement with gap if

\- the UE indicates 'gap' via *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for the
inter-RAT measurement

When network configures measurement gap, the delay requirements are
specified in clauses 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.

\- For inter-RAT measurements with NCSG, UE may cause scheduling
restriction as specified in clause 9.4.2.5 and 9.4.3.5.

For UE not supporting *eutra-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17*,

\- An inter-RAT measurement is defined as measurement without gap if

\- the UE supports FG32-5 and the CRS is completely contained in the
active BWP of the UE, and the inter-RAT EUTRAN measurements without gaps
requirements are specified in clause 9.4.8.

For inter-RAT, when measurement is defined as measurement without gap
the UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.4.8.3.5
and clause 9.4.8.4.5.

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD
measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR, or E-CID RSRP and RSRQ) configured by
NR PCell is on an E-UTRA serving frequency carrier, then the
corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements requirements specified
in clause 8.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\] shall apply.

When *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured but UE does not support
either *measurementEnhancement-r16* or
*interRAT-MeasurementEnhancement-r16*, the UE is not required to meet
the requirements specified in table 9.4.2.3-2 and table 9.4.3.3-2.

Parameter T~Inter1~ used in inter-RAT requirements in clause 9.4 is
specified in table 9.4.1-1 when measurement gap is used, and in table
9.4.1-2 when NCSG is used.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

*A UE configured with gap/NCSG pattern ID 2, 3 or 10 shall be able to

### 9.4.2 NR − E-UTRAN FDD measurements

#### 9.4.2.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN FDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
10.2.5 are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the
corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS
36.133 \[15\].

#### 9.4.2.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps or NCSG to identify and measure
inter-RAT cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
scheduled, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are scheduled, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated, or the UE supports
capability of conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ according to the following expression:

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ FDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1,

CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ when measurement gaps are
configured, or CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ when NCSGs are configured, is the
scaling factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is
calculated as specified in clause 9.1.5.2.

> For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent GAPs or MUSIM gaps
> or both concurrent GAPs and MUSIM gaps, K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the
> scaling factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer to be measured within
> the associated GAP pattern. **K~gap~**~\_EUTRA~ **= 1** when the UE is
> not **configured with concurrent GAPs nor MUSIM gaps. Otherwise,**
> K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured with
> concurrent GAPs.

For a window W of duration xRP\_max, where xRP\_max is the maximum xRP
across all configured per-UE measurement GAPs, periodic MUSIM gaps, and
per-FR measurement GAPs for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any
associated gap occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of associated GAP occasions within the
window, including those dropped and non-dropped occasions within the
window, and

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated GAP occasions
**after accounting for measurement GAP** and MUSIM gap **collisions by
applying the collision rules for the GAP** and MUSIM gap **in clause
9.1.8.3** and 9.1.10.5, respectively.

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG, also xRP = MGRP for periodic MUSIM
gap.

Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent GAPs *or
MUSIM gaps*, if N~available~ =0

When UE supports ***musim-GapPreference-r17*** and if the configured
aperiodic MUSIM gap collides with the measurement gap associated with
the target frequency layer, where MUSIM gap collision rule in clause
9.1.10.4 is applied, longer cell identification period for the target
inter-RAT carrier is expected.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in table 9.4.2.2-1.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

When measurement gaps are scheduled for E-UTRAN FDD inter-RAT
measurements, or the UE supports capability of conducting such
measurements without gaps, the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements to higher layers with
measurement period **T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~** given by table
9.4.2.2-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.2.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When DRX is in use and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
configured, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are configured, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ specified in table 9.4.2.3-1. When
*highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured and UE supports the enhanced
inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurement requirements, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ specified in table 9.4.2.3-2.

> For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent GAPs, or MUSIM gaps
> or both concurrent GAPs and MUSIM gaps, K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the
> scaling factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer to be measured within
> the associated GAP pattern. **K~gap~**~\_EUTRA~ **= 1** when the UE is
> not **configured with concurrent GAPs nor MUSIM gaps. Otherwise,**
> K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured with
> concurrent GAPs.

For a window W of duration xRP\_max, where xRP\_max is the maximum xRP
across all configured per-UE GAPs, periodic MUSIM gap(s), and per-FR
GAPs for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any associated gap
occasion:

N~total~ is the total number of associated GAP occasions within the
window, including both dropped and non-dropped instances of the
associated GAP within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated GAP occasions
**after accounting for measurement gap** and MUSIM gap **collisions by
applying the collision rules for the GAP** and MUSIM gap **in clauses
9.1.8.3** and 9.1.10.5, respectively.

> **- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP
> = VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG**, also xRP = MGRP for periodic
> MUSIM gap**.**

Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent GAPs, *or
MUSIM gaps*, if N~available~ = 0

When UE supports ***musim-GapPreference-r17*** and if the configured
aperiodic MUSIM gap collides with the measurement gap associated with
the target frequency layer, where MUSIM gap collision rule in clause
9.1.10.4 is applied, longer cell identification period for the target
inter-RAT carrier is expected.

no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.2.2 and 9.4.2.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap or NCSG has not
been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

#### 9.4.2.5 Scheduling Availability During NR − E-UTRAN FDD measurements with NCSG

When a serving cell and an E-UTRA FDD measurement object are in bands
with overlapping frequency with different subcarrier spacings, UE is not
expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS
for CQI on all symbols within NCSG ML. Otherwise, no scheduling
restriction to the serving cell is allowed due to NR − E-UTRAN FDD
measurements with NCSG.

### 9.4.3 NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements

#### 9.4.3.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN TDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.5
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\].

#### 9.4.3.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps or NCSG to identify and measure
inter-RAT cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
scheduled, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are scheduled, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated or the UE supports
capability of conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be
able to identify a new detectable TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ according to the following expression:

\- When configuration 0 or configuration 1 in table 9.4.3.2-1 is
applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

> \- When configuration 2 or configuration 3 in table 9.4.3.2-1 is
> applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA} + 240 \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{gap\_ EUTRA}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1,

CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ when measurement gaps are
configured, or CSSF~within\_ncsg,i~ when NCSGs are configured, is the
scaling factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is
calculated as specified in clause 9.1.5.2.

For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent GAPs, or MUSIM gaps
or both concurrent GAPs and MUSIM gaps, K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the scaling
factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer to be measured within the
associated GAP pattern. **K~gap~**~\_EUTRA~ **= 1** when the UE is not
**configured with concurrent GAPs** nor MUSIM gaps**. Otherwise,**
K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured with
concurrent GAPs or MUSIM gaps.

\- For a window W of duration xRP\_max , where xRP\_max is the maximum
xRP across all configured per-UE GAPs, periodic MUSIM gaps,and per-FR
GAPs for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any associated gap
occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of associated GAP occasions within the
window, including those **overlapped** with other GAPs and MUSIM gap
ocassions within the window, and

\- N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated GAP occasions
**after accounting for** GAPs and MUSIM gap **collisions by applying the
GAP** and MUSIM gap **in clauses 9.1.8.3** and 9.1.10.5, respectively.

**- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG**, also xRP = MGRP for periodic MUSIM
gap**.**

\- Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent GAP**s**
or MUSIM gaps, if N~available~ =0

When UE supports ***musim-GapPreference-r17*** and if the configured
aperiodic MUSIM gap collides with the measurement gap associated with
the target frequency layer, where MUSIM gap collision rule in clause
9.1.10.4 is applied, longer cell identification period for the target
inter-RAT carrier is expected.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in table 9.4.3.2-1.

+---------+---------+---------+-------+---------+---------+---------+

When measurement gaps are scheduled for E-UTRAN TDD inter-RAT
measurements, or the UE supports capability of conducting such
measurements without gaps, the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements to higher layers with
measurement period T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ given by table 9.4.3.2-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

#### 9.4.3.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When DRX is in use and an appropriate measurement gap pattern or NCSG is
configured, or when the UE is capable of concurrent measurement gap
patterns and concurrent measurement gap patterns are configured, or an
appropriate pre-MG is scheduled and activated, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ specified in table 9.4.3.3-1. When
*highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is configured and UE supports the enhanced
inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurement requirements, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable E-UTRAN TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ specified in table 9.4.3.3-2.

> For a UE supporting and configured with concurrent GAPs, or MUSIM gaps
> or both concurrent GAPs and MUSIM gaps, K~gap\_EUTRA~: it is the
> scaling factor for an E-UTRAN frequency layer to be measured within

> not **configured with concurrent GAPs** nor MUSIM gaps**..
> Otherwise,** K~gap\_EUTRA~ = N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured

For a window W of duration xRP\_max, where xRP\_max is the maximum xRP
across all configured per-UE GAPs s, periodic MUSIM gap(s), and per-FR
measurement GAPs for FR1, and starting from the beginning of any
associated gap occasion: GAPs

N~total~ is the total number of associated GAP occasions within the
window, including those **overlapped** with other measurement GAP and
MUSIM gap instances within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated GAP occasions
**after accounting for measurement gap** and MUSIM gap **collisions by
applying the collision rules for the GAP** and MUSIM gap **in clauses
9.1.8.3,** 9.1.10.5, **9.1.12.3, and 9.1.13.3**, respectively.

**- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG**, also xRP = MGRP for periodic MUSIM
gap**.**

Requirements do not apply for UE configured with concurrent GAPs or
MUSIM gaps, if N~available~ = 0

When UE supports ***musim-GapPreference-r17*** and if the configured
aperiodic MUSIM gap collides with the measurement gap associated with
the target frequency layer, where MUSIM gap collision rule in clause
9.1.10.4 is applied, longer cell identification period for the target
inter-RAT carrier is expected.

##### 9.4.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

##### 9.4.3.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.3.4.3.

##### 9.4.3.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.3.2 and 9.4.3.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap or NCSG has not
been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

#### 9.4.3.5 Scheduling Availability During NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements with NCSG

When UE supports *simultaneousRxTxInterBandENDC* for a band combination,
no scheduling restriction is applicable to NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements
with NCSG in this band combination; otherwise UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols within NCSG ML.

When a serving cell and an E-UTRA TDD measurement object are in bands
with overlapping frequency with different subcarrier spacings, UE is not
expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS
for CQI on all symbols within NCSG ML. Otherwise, no scheduling
restriction to the serving cell is allowed due to NR − E-UTRAN TDD
measurements with NCSG.

### 9.4.4 Inter-RAT RSTD measurements

#### 9.4.4.1 NR − E-UTRAN FDD RSTD measurements

##### 9.4.4.1.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSTD measurements
requested via LPP \[22, 27\].

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSTD
measurement configured by NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency
carrier, then the corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements
requirements as follows shall apply.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA PSCC shall meet E-UTRAN OTDOA
intra-frequency measurements requirements in clause 8.1.2.5. The
applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.10.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA SCC shall meet all applicable
requirements in clause 8.4, except that the terms PCell and primary
component carrier shall be deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.
The applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.12,
except that the terms PCell and primary component carrier shall be
deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.

The requirements in clause 9.4.4.1 apply when:

\- the UE is provided with the LTE timing information via LPP \[27\],
including both *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is not provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* or
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* but not with
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*.

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE may be using autonomous gaps to acquire
SFN of the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to requesting
measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements
before the T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~ time period starts while
meeting all the requirements in clause 9.4.4.1.2, provided that the
OTDOA assistance data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to
acquire the SFN before the T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~ starts.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps to perform
cell detection for the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to
requesting measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD
measurements before the T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~ time period
starts while meeting all the requirements in clause 9.4.4.1.2, provided
that the OTDOA assistance data is provided to allow sufficient time for
the UE to detect the cell before the T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~
starts.

##### 9.4.4.1.2 Requirements

When the physical layer cell identities of neighbour cells together with
the OTDOA assistance data are provided, the UE shall be able to detect
and measure inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD RSTD, specified in TS 38.215 \[4\],
for at least *n*=16 cells, including the reference cell, within
T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~ ms as given below:

$T_{InterRAT,E - UTRAN\_ FDD} = T_{\text{PRS}} \times \left( M - 1 \right) + \Delta$
,

where

T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~ is the total time for detecting and
measuring at least *n* cells,

T~PRS~ is the largest value of the cell-specific positioning subframe
configuration period, defined in TS 36.211 \[23\], among the measured
*n* cells including the reference cell,

*M* is the number of PRS positioning occasions as defined in table
9.4.4.1.2-1, where each PRS positioning occasion comprises of N~PRS~ (1≤
N~PRS~ ≤6) consecutive downlink positioning subframes defined in
TS 36.211 \[23\],

CSSF~interRAT~=CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor determined by
the gap sharing scheme for the RSTD measurements on the carrier
frequency *i* as defined in clause 9.1.5.2,

> $\Delta = 160 \times \left\lceil \frac{n}{M} \right\rceil$![](./media/image15.wmf){width="0.15833333333333333in"

the *n* cells are distributed on up to two E-UTRAN FDD carrier
frequencies.

+----------------------+----------------------+---------------------+

The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting RSTD for the
reference cell and all the neighbor cells *i* out of at least (*n*-1)
neighbor cells within T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~ provided:

(PRS Ês/Iot)*~ref~* ≥-6 dB for all Frequency Bands for the reference
cell,

(PRS Ês/Iot)~i~ ≥-13 dB for all Frequency Bands for neighbour cell *i*,

(PRS Ês/Iot)*~ref~* and (PRS Ês/Iot)~i~ conditions apply for all
subframes of at least $L = \frac{M}{2}\ $PRS positioning occasions,

PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to TS 36.133 \[15, Annex B.2.6\] for a
corresponding band,

PRS Ês/Iot is defined as the ratio of the average received energy per
PRS resource element during the useful part of the symbol to the average
received power spectral density of the total noise and interference for
this resource element, where the ratio is measured over all resource
elements which carry PRS.

The time T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_FDD~ starts from the first subframe
of the PRS positioning occasion closest in time after both the
*OTDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message and the OTDOA assistance data
in the *OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData* message via LPP as specified in
TS 38.305 \[22\], are delivered to the physical layer of the UE.

The RSTD measurement accuracy for all measured neighbor cells *i* shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy as specified in clause 10.2.4.

##### 9.4.4.1.2.1 RSTD Measurement Reporting Delay {#rstd-measurement-reporting-delay .H6}

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

##### 9.4.4.1.2.2 Requirements for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell {#requirements-for-acquiring-the-timing-of-the-e-utra-otdoa-reference-cell .H6}

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE supporting per-FR gaps may make autonomous
gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the PCell, PSCell,
and each of the SCells in FR1 for acquiring SFN of the reference cell in
the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data, while no autonomous gaps in downlink
reception or uplink transmission are allowed in any of the UE serving
cells in FR2. The UE, which are only supporting per-UE gaps, may make
autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the
PCell, PSCell, and each of the SCells for acquiring the SFN of the
reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps while
indicating *eutra-FineTimingDetection* according to TS 38.331 \[2\] for
detecting the reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is performing one or both of SFN acquisition or cell
detection as specified above, the UE shall be able to determine the
timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell during the
time period

T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ = T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ + T~MIB~ + T~ECGI~ ,

where

T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ = T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ -
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ is according to clause 9.4.2 assuming
CSSF~interRAT~ = 1 and it is the time needed to detect the E-UTRA OTDOA
assistance data reference cell when the UE needs to acquire the subframe
and slot timing of the cell, provided the UE is configured with
measurement gaps (T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ = 0 when both
*nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset* are provided in the
E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data or the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data
reference cell is known to the UE), and

T~MIB~ = 50 ms is the time required to acquire SFN and/or PHICH
configuration of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell
provided the OTDOA assistance data reference cell is decodable and at
least all E-UTRA subframes \#0 during T~MIB~ are available at the UE
receiver (T~MIB~ = 0 when *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* is provided in the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data and ECGI acquisition is not needed), and

T~ECGI~ = 100 ms is the time required to acquire ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell when *cellGlobalId* is included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* and the UE is not aware of the ECGI of this
cell (T~ECGI~ = 0 when *cellGlobalId* is not included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* or the UE is aware of the ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell).

When detecting the E-UTRAN OTDOA reference cell, the requirements in
this clause shall be met, provided the conditions for the detectable
cell are fulfilled according to clause 9.4.2.1. In addition, the MIB of
the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell whose SFN is acquired shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to TS 36.101 \[25\].

The requirement for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference
cell within T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well
as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

When T~MIB~ \> 0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during T~MIB~, the UE
shall transmit at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB,\ FDD~ ACK/NACKs on PCell,
PSCell, and each of activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where the
autonomous gaps are created, specified in table 9.4.4.1.2.2-1. When both
T~MIB~ \> 0 and T~ECGI~ \> 0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during
T~MIB~ +T~ECGI~, the UE shall transmit on PCell, PSCell, and each of
activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where autonomous gaps are
created at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB+ECGI,\ FDD~ ACK/NACKs specified in
table 9.4.4.1.2.2-3, provided the OTDOA reference cell bandwidth is
configured in the OTDOA assistance data \[22, 27\]. The requirements in
Tables 9.4.4.1.2.2-1, 9.4.4.1.2.2-2, and 9.4.4.1.2.2-3 apply, provided
that:

\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

\- no DRX cycle is used,

\- no measurement gaps are configured,

\- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,

\- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,

\- 20 ms SMTC period is configured,

\- SSBs are transmitted in one slot within SMTC window.

#### 9.4.4.2 NR − E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements

##### 9.4.4.2.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSTD measurements
requested via LPP \[22, 27\].

When the UE is in NE-DC operation mode and an NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSTD
measurement configured by NR PCell is on a E-UTRA serving frequency
carrier, then the corresponding E-UTRA intra-frequency measurements
requirements as follows shall apply.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA PSCC shall meet E-UTRAN OTDOA
intra-frequency measurements requirements in clause 8.1.2.5. The
applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.10.

\- Measurements configured on E-UTRA SCC shall meet all applicable
requirements in clause 8.4, except that the terms PCell and primary
component carrier shall be deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.
The applicable measurement accuracy requirements are in clause 9.1.12,
except that the terms PCell and primary component carrier shall be
deemed to be swapped with PSCell and PSCC.

The requirements in clause 9.4.4.1 apply when:

\- the UE is provided with the LTE timing information via LPP \[27\],
including both *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is not provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* or
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*, or

\- the UE is provided with *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* but not with
*nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset*.

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE may be using autonomous gaps to acquire
SFN of the OTDOA assistance data reference cell prior to requesting
measurement gaps for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements
before the T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_TDD~ time period starts while
meeting all the requirements in clause 9.4.4.2.2, provided that the
OTDOA assistance data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to
acquire the SFN before the ![](./media/image17.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} starts. When the UE is not aware of and
cannot derive the subframe timing difference between the NR serving cell
and the OTDOA assistance data reference cell, the UE may need to request
measurement gaps to perform cell detection for the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell prior to requesting measurement gaps for performing the
requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements before the
T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_TDD~ time period starts while meeting all the
requirements in clause 9.4.4.2.2, provided that the OTDOA assistance
data is provided to allow sufficient time for the UE to detect the cell
before the T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_TDD~ starts.

##### 9.4.4.2.2 Requirements

When the physical layer cell identities of neighbour cells together with
the OTDOA assistance data are provided, the UE shall be able to detect
and measure inter-RAT -UTRAN TDD RSTD, specified in TS 38.215 \[4\], for
at least *n*=16 cells, including the reference cell, within
T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_TDD~ ms as given below:

$T_{InterRAT,E - UTRAN\_ TDD} = T_{\text{PRS}} \times \left( M - 1 \right) + \Delta$
,

where

T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_TDD~ is the total time for detecting and
measuring at least *n* cells,

T~PRS~ is the largest value of the cell-specific positioning subframe
configuration period, defined in TS 36.211 \[23\], among the measured
*n* cells including the reference cell,

*M* is the number of PRS positioning occasions as defined in table
9.4.4.2.2-1, where a PRS positioning occasion is as defined in
clause 9.4.4.1.2,

CSSF~interRAT~=CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor determined by
the gap sharing scheme for the RSTD measurements on the carrier
frequency *i* as defined in clause 9.1.5.2,

$\Delta = 160 \times \frac{n}{M}$ ms is the measurement time for a
single PRS positioning occasion which includes the sampling time and the
processing time, and

the *n* cells are distributed on up to two E-UTRAN TDD carrier
frequencies.

The requirements in this clause shall apply for all TDD special subframe
configurations specified in TS 36.211 \[23\] and for the TDD
uplink-downlink configurations as specified in table 9.4.4.2.2-2 for UE
requiring measurement gaps for these measurements. For UEs capable of

The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting RSTD for the
reference cell and all the neighbor cells *i* out of at least (*n*-1)
neighbor cells within ![](./media/image18.wmf){width="1.5in"
height="0.26666666666666666in"} provided:

(PRS Ês/Iot)*~ref~* ![](./media/image19.wmf){width="1.075in"

(PRS Ês/Iot)*~ref~* ![](./media/image19.wmf){width="1.075in"
height="0.3in"} and (PRS Ês/Iot)~i~ conditions apply for all subframes
of at least $L = \frac{\text{M\ }}{2}$PRS positioning occasions,

PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to TS 36.133 \[15, Annex B.2.6\] for a
corresponding band,

PRS Ês/Iot is as defined in clause 9.4.4.1.2.

The time T~RSTD\_InterRAT,E-UTRAN\_TDD~ starts from the first subframe
of the PRS positioning occasion closest in time after both the
OTDOA-RequestLocationInformation message and the OTDOA assistance data
in the OTDOA-ProvideAssistanceData message via LPP as specified in
TS 38.305 \[22\], are delivered to the physical layer of the UE.

The RSTD measurement accuracy for all measured neighbor cells *i* shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy as specified in clause 10.2.4.

##### 9.4.4.2.2.1 RSTD Measurement Reporting Delay {#rstd-measurement-reporting-delay-1 .H6}

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

##### 9.4.4.2.2.2 Requirements for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell {#requirements-for-acquiring-the-timing-of-the-e-utra-otdoa-reference-cell-1 .H6}

When the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one LTE cell in the
OTDOA assistance data, the UE supporting per-FR gaps may make autonomous
gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the PCell, PSCell,
and each of the SCells in FR1 for acquiring SFN of the reference cell in
the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data, while no autonomous gaps in downlink
reception or uplink transmission are allowed in any of the UE serving
cells in FR2. The UE, which are only supporting per-UE gaps, may make
autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission of the
PCell, PSCell, and each of the SCells for acquiring the SFN of the
reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is not aware of and cannot derive the subframe timing
difference between the NR serving cell and the OTDOA assistance data
reference cell, the UE may need to request measurement gaps while
indicating *eutra-FineTimingDetection* according to TS 38.331 \[2\] for
detecting the reference cell in the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data.

When the UE is performing one or both of SFN acquisition or cell
detection as specified above, the UE shall be able to determine the
timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell during the
time period

T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ = T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ + T~MIB~ + T~ECGI~ ,

where

T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ = T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ -
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ is according to clause 9.4.3 assuming
CSSF~interRAT~ = 1 and it is the time needed to detect the E-UTRA OTDOA
assistance data reference cell when the UE needs to acquire the subframe
and slot timing of the cell, provided the UE is configured with
measurement gaps (T~Detect,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ = 0 when both
*nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* and *nr-LTE-fineTiming-Offset* are provided in the
E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data or the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data
reference cell is known to the UE), and

T~MIB~ = 50 ms is the time required to acquire SFN and/or PHICH
configuration of the E-UTRA OTDOA assistance data reference cell
provided the OTDOA assistance data reference cell is decodable and at
least all E-UTRA subframes \#0 during T~MIB~ are available at the UE
receiver (T~MIB~ = 0 when *nr-LTE-SFN-Offset* is provided in the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data and ECGI acquisition is not needed), and

T~ECGI~ = 100 ms is the time required to acquire ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell when *cellGlobalId* is included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* and the UE is not aware of the ECGI of this
cell (T~ECGI~ = 0 when *cellGlobalId* is not included in
*OTDOA-ReferenceCellInfo* or the UE is aware of the ECGI of the E-UTRA
OTDOA assistance data reference cell).

When detecting the E-UTRAN OTDOA reference cell, the requirements in
this clause shall be met, provided the conditions for the detectable
cell are fulfilled according to clause 9.4.3.1. In addition, the MIB of
the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell whose SFN is acquired shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to TS 36.101 \[25\].

The requirement for acquiring the timing of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference
cell within T~RefCell,E-UTRAN~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well
as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

When T~MIB~ \> 0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during T~MIB~, the UE
shall transmit at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB,\ TDD~ ACK/NACKs on PCell,
PSCell, and each of activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where the
autonomous gaps are created, specified in table 9.4.4.2.2.2-1. When both
T~MIB~ \> 0 and T~ECGI~ \> 0 and UE is using autonomous gaps during
T~MIB~+T~ECGI~, the UE shall transmit on PCell, PSCell, and each of
activated SCell(s) in the frequency range where autonomous gaps are
created at least N~ACK/NACK,\ MIB+ECGI,\ TDD~ ACK/NACKs specified in
table 9.4.4.2.2.2-3, provided the OTDOA reference cell bandwidth is
configured in the OTDOA assistance data \[22, 27\]. The requirements in
Tables 9.4.4.2.2.2-1, and 9.4.4.2.2.2-3 apply, provided that:

\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

\- no DRX cycle is used,

\- no measurement gaps are configured,

\- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,

\- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,

\- 20 ms SMTC period is configured,

\- SSBs are transmitted in one slot within SMTC window.

### 9.4.5 Inter-RAT E-CID measurements

#### 9.4.5.1 NR−E-UTRAN FDD E-CID RSRP and RSRQ measurements

##### 9.4.5.1.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.4.5.1. shall apply provided the UE has
received *ECID-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP
requesting the UE to report inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD E-CID RSRP and RSRQ
measurements \[22, 27\].

##### 9.4.5.1.2 Requirements

The requirements in clause 9.4.2 also apply for this clause except the
measurement reporting requirements. The measurement reporting
requirements for E-CID RSRP and RSRQ are defined in clause 9.4.5.1.3.

##### 9.4.5.1.3 Measurement Reporting Delay

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

Reported RSRP and RSRQ measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2 and
10.2.3, respectively.

#### 9.4.5.2 NR−E-UTRAN TDD E-CID RSRP and RSRQ measurements

##### 9.4.5.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.4.5.2. shall apply provided the UE has
received *ECID-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP
requesting the UE to report inter-RAT E-UTRAN TDD E-CID RSRP and RSRQ
measurements \[22, 27\].

##### 9.4.5.2.2 Requirements

The requirements in clause 9.4.3 also apply for this clause except the
measurement reporting requirements. The measurement reporting
requirements for E-CID RSRP and RSRQ are defined in clause 9.4.5.2.3.

##### 9.4.5.2.3 Measurement Reporting Delay

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

Reported RSRP and RSRQ measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2 and
10.2.3, respectively.

### 9.4.6 NR − UTRAN FDD measurements

#### 9.4.6.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR− UTRAN FDD CPICH RSCP and CPICH
Ec/No measurements for SRVCC.

#### 9.4.6.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

##### 9.4.6.2.1 Identification of a new UTRA FDD cell {#identification-of-a-new-utra-fdd-cell .H6}

When explicit neighbour list is provided and no DRX is used, either
measurement gaps are scheduled or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable cell belonging to the monitored set within

$T_{identify,\ UTRA\_ FDD} = T_{basic\_ identify\_ UTRA\_ FDD\ } \times \frac{480}{T_{inter1}} \times \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}}\text{\ ms}$

A cell shall be considered detectable when

\- CPICH Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB,

\- SCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -17 dB for at least one channel tap and
SCH\_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code and
secondary synchronisation code. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected.

##### 9.4.6.2.2 UE UTRA FDD CPICH measurement capability {#ue-utra-fdd-cpich-measurement-capability .H6}

When measurement gaps are scheduled for UTRA FDD inter RAT measurements,
or the UE supports capability of conducting such measurements without
gaps, the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements
to higher layers with measurement accuracy as specified in Clause 10
with measurement period given by

$T_{Measurement\_ UTRA\_ FDD} = Max\left\{ T_{Measurement\_ Period\_ UTRA\_ FDD} \times \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}},\ T_{basic\_ measurement\_ UTRA\_ FDD} \times \frac{480}{T_{inter1}} \times \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \right\}\text{\ m}$

The UE shall be capable of performing UTRA FDD CPICH measurements for
X~basic\ measurementUTRA\_FDD~ inter-frequency cells per FDD frequency
and the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to
higher layers with the measurement period of
T~Measurement\_\ UTRA\_FDD.~

> X~basic\ measurement\ UTRA\_FDD~ = 6
>
> T~Measurement\_Period\ UTRA\_FDD~ = 480 ms. The period used for
> calculating the measurement period T~measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~ for UTRA
> FDD CPICH measurements.
>
> T~basic\_identify\_UTRA\_FDD~ = 300 ms. This is the time period used
> in the inter-RAT equation in clause 9.4.6.2.1 where the maximum
> allowed time for the UE to identify a new UTRA FDD cell is defined.
>
> T~basic\_measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~ = 50 ms. This is the time period used
> in the equation for defining the measurement period for inter-RAT
> CPICH measurements.
>
> CSSF~interRAT~ = CSSF~within\_gap,i~ is the scaling factor for the
> measured inter-RAT UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated as specified
> in clause 9.1.5.2.

T~inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.1.

##### 9.4.6.2.3 Periodic Reporting {#periodic-reporting-4 .H6}

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

##### 9.4.6.2.4 Event Triggered Reporting {#event-triggered-reporting-4 .H6}

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clause 10.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify,\ UTRA\_FDD~ defined in
clause 9.4.6.2.1 for the minimum requirements. When L3 filtering is used
an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify,\ UTRA\_FDD~ defined in clause 9.4.6.2.1 for the minimum
requirements and then triggers the measurement report as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~ defined in clause 9.4.6.2.2
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ± 32 chips
while measurement gap has not been available and the L3 filter has not
been used. When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be
expected.

##### 9.4.6.2.5 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting {#event-triggered-periodic-reporting-4 .H6}

Reported measurements contained in event triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.6.2.4 Event Triggered
Reporting.

#### 9.4.6.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When explicit neighbour list is provided and DRX is used, either
measurement gaps are scheduled or the UE supports capability of
conducting such measurements without gaps, the UE shall be able to
identify a new detectable cell belonging to the neighbour cell list
within T~identify,UTRA\_FDD~ as shown in table 9.4.6.3-1

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

The measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
the clause 10.3.

##### 9.4.6.3.1 Periodic Reporting {#periodic-reporting-5 .H6}

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

##### 9.4.6.3.2 Event Triggered Reporting {#event-triggered-reporting-5 .H6}

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clause 10.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify,UTRA\_FDD~ defined in clause
9.4.6.3. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify,\ UTRA\_FDD~ defined in clause 9.4.6.3 and then triggers the
measurement report as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered
measurement reporting delay shall be less than T~measurement\_UTRA\_FDD~
defined in clause 9.4.6.3 provided the timing to that cell has not
changed more than ± 32 chips while measurement gap has not been
available and the L3 filter has not been used. When L3 filtering is
used, an additional delay can be expected.

##### 9.4.6.3.3 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting {#event-triggered-periodic-reporting-5 .H6}

Reported measurements contained in event triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.6.3.2 Event Triggered
Reporting.

### 9.4.7 NR -- E-UTRAN measurements with autonomous gaps

#### 9.4.7.1 CGI identification of an E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps

The requirements in this clause apply when the UE is configured with
standalone NR, NE-DC or NR-DC. The UE shall identify and report the CGI
when requested by an NR PCell for the purpose 'reportCGI'. The UE may
make autonomous gaps in downlink reception and uplink transmission for
receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to clause 5.5.3.1 in
TS 38.331 \[2\]. If autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the
purpose of 'reportCGI', regardless of whether DRX is used or not, or
regardless of whether SCell(s) are configured or not, the UE shall be
able to identify a new CGI of E-UTRA cell within
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}$= 150 ms. This is the maximum
allowed time for the UE to identify a new CGI of an E-UTRA cell,
provided that the E-UTRA cell has been already identified by the UE.

A cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are
fulfilled:

\- RSRP related side conditions given in clause 9.1 in \[15\] are
fulfilled for a corresponding band,

\- SCH\_RP and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 in \[15\] for a
corresponding band

The MIB of an E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be considered
decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation requirements are met
according to \[25\].

The requirement for identifying a new CGI of an E-UTRA cell within
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}$ is applicable when no DRX is used
as well as when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is
used.

#### 9.4.7.2 CGI reporting delay

The E-UTRA CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command
that will trigger an E-UTRA CGI report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE
to send the measurement report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}$ plus RRC procedure delay defined in
clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\], and an additional 30 ms margin.

### 9.4.8 NR -- E-UTRAN measurements without measurement gaps

#### 9.4.8.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are specified for NR−E-UTRAN FDD and
NR−E-UTRAN TDD measurements and are applicable without an explicit
E-UTRAN neighbour cell list containing physical layer cell identities,
for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and configured with SA with NR−E-UTRAN FDD
or TDD measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR, RSTD, or E-CID RSRP and RSRQ)
on E-UTRA frequency carrier

The inter-RAT E-UTRA measurement requirements in this clause are
applicable provided

> \- UE supports eutra-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17 and indicates
> '*nogap-noncsg*' in the E-UTRA band in *NeedForGapNCSG-InfoEUTRA* for
> inter-RAT E-UTRA measurement, and UE supports 32-4, or

\- UE supports \[case b-2\].

#### 9.4.8.2 General requirements

If an NR -- E-UTRAN measurement does not cause scheduling restriction as
defined in clause 9.4.8.3.5 or 9.4.8.4.5, the measurement is performed
outside measurement gaps.

If an NR -- E-UTRAN measurement causes scheduling restriction as defined
in clause 9.4.8.3.5 or 9.4.8.4.5, the measurement is performed within
measurement gaps if one of the following conditions is met, and the
requirements in clause 9.4.2 or 9.4.3 apply.

\- EMW is configured and fully overlapped with measurement gap, and the
periodicity of measurement gap and EMW is same, or

\- EMW is not configured.

Otherwise, the measurement is performed within EMW occasions and
requirements in clause 9.4.8 apply.

When UE is configured with EMW and measurement gap, EMW and measurement
gap occasions are considered colliding if the two occasions are fully or
partially overlapping in time domain.

When UE is configured with EMW and SMTC or SSB/CSI-RS configured for
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement, EMW and SMTC or SSB/CSI-RS occasions
are considered colliding if the two occasions are fully or partially
overlapping in time domain, provided that inter-RAT measurement during
EMW would cause scheduling restriction.

In case of collision between EMW and measurement gap and EMW periodicity
is smaller than MGRP, scheduling restriction specified in clause 9.4.8.2
does not apply in the EMW occasions colliding with measurement gap.

In case of collision between EMW and SMTC or SSB/CSI-RS configured for
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement, scheduling restriction specified in
clause 9.4.8.2 does not apply in the EMW occasions colliding with SMTC
or SSB/CSI-RS configured for RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement.

Parameter T~Inter1~ used in inter-RAT requirements in clause 9.4.8 is
\[60\]ms if the measurement is performed outside measurement gaps
without EMW configuration. If the measurement is performed with EMW
configuration, T~Inter1~ is defined at table 9.4.8.2-1.

#### 9.4.8.3 NR − E-UTRAN FDD measurements

##### 9.4.8.3.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN FDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
10.2.5 are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the
corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS
36.133 \[15\].

##### 9.4.8.3.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

> The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable FDD cell within
> T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ according to the following expression:

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ FDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{\lbrack 480\rbrack}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{P}\text{\ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = \[480 ms\],

T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.8.1,

CSSF~interRAT~ = \[CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1\].

> **-** \[Kp is the scaling factor due to overlapping between EMW and
> SMTC, measurement gap, or SSB/CSI-RS configured for
> RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement. Kp =1 if the measurement is performed
> outside EMW or if EMW is fully non-overlapped with SMTC, SSB/CSI-RS
> configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement and measurement
> gap. Otherwise, K~p~ = N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and
> N~total~ are calculated as follows:

\- For a window W of duration max(EMW period, SMTC period, MGRP, T~SSB~,
T~CSI-RS~), where SMTC period follows *smtc1* if high layer in TS 38.331
\[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is not present on the same carrier frequency.
Otherwise, SMTC period follows *smtc2*, T~SSB~/T~CSI-RS~ is the
periodicity of SSB/CSI-RS configured for RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement
on the same carrier frequency, and starting from the beginning of any
SMTC occasion.

\- N~total~ is the total number of EMW occasions within the window W,
including those overlapped with SMTC, measurement gap, or SSB/CSI-RS
configured for RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement, and

\- N~available~ is the number of EMW occasions that are not overlapped
with any SMTC, measurement gap, or SSB/CSI-RS configured for
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement within the window W, after accounting
for EMW collisions by applying the EMW collision rule in clause 9.4.8.2.

**- No requirement applies for the measurement when Navailable = 0.**

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in table 9.4.8.3.2-1.

The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements to higher layers with measurement period
T~measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ given by table 9.4.8.3.2-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

##### 9.4.8.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting {#periodic-reporting-6 .H6}

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

##### 9.4.8.3.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting {#event-triggered-periodic-reporting-6 .H6}

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.8.3.4.3.

##### 9.4.8.3.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting {#event-triggered-reporting-6 .H6}

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.8.3.2 and 9.4.8.3.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap or NCSG has not
been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

##### 9.4.8.3.5 Scheduling availability during NR − E-UTRAN FDD measurements

When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction.

##### 9.4.8.3.5.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing inter-RAT measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1 {#scheduling-availability-of-ue-performing-inter-rat-measurements-with-a-different-subcarrier-spacing-than-pdschpdcch-on-fr1 .H6}

When UE performs inter-RAT measurement outside MG and the E-UTRA carrier
is fully or partially overlapping with the DL active BWP of the serving
cell, for UE which do not support \[*FG32-7\]* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on \[all symbols within EMW duration\].

#### 9.4.8.4 NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements

##### 9.4.8.4.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN TDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.5
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\].

##### 9.4.8.4.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable TDD cell within
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ according to the following expression:

\- When configuration 0 or configuration 1 in table 9.4.8.4.2-1 is
applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{\lbrack 480\rbrack}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{P}\text{\ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

> \- When configuration 2 or configuration 3 in table 9.4.8.4.2-1 is
> applied,

$T_{Identify,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{\lbrack 480\rbrack}{T_{Inter1}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{P} + 240 \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}} \bullet K_{P}\text{\ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = \[480 ms\],

T~Inter1~ is defined in clause 9.4.8.1,

CSSF~interRAT~ = \[CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.1\].

> Kp is the scaling factor due to overlapping between EMW and SMTC,
> measurement gap, or SSB/CSI-RS configured for RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP
> measurement. Kp =1 if the measurement is performed outside EMW or if
> EMW is fully non-overlapped with SMTC, SSB/CSI-RS configured for RLM,
> BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement and measurement gap. Otherwise, K~p~ =
> N~total~ / N~available~, where N~available~ and N~total~ are
> calculated as follows:

\- For a window W of duration max(EMW period, SMTC period, MGRP, T~SSB~,
T~CSI-RS~), where SMTC period follows *smtc1* if high layer in TS 38.331
\[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is not present on the same carrier frequency.
Otherwise, SMTC period follows *smtc2*, T~SSB~/T~CSI-RS~ is the
periodicity of SSB/CSI-RS configured for RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement
on the same carrier frequency, and starting from the beginning of any
SMTC occasion

\- N~total~ is the total number of EMW occasions within the window,
including those overlapped with SMTC, measurement gap, or SSB/CSI-RS
configured for RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement, and

\- N~available~ is the number of EMW occasions that are not overlapped
with any SMTC, measurement gap, or SSB/CSI-RS configured for
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement within the window W, after accounting
for EMW collisions by applying the EMW collision rule in clause 9.4.8.2.

\- **No requirement applies for the measurement** when N~available~ = 0.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in table 9.4.8.4.2-1.

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

##### 9.4.8.4.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4.8.4.4.1 Periodic Reporting {#periodic-reporting-7 .H6}

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

##### 9.4.8.4.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting {#event-triggered-periodic-reporting-7 .H6}

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4.8.4.4.3.

##### 9.4.8.4.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting {#event-triggered-reporting-7 .H6}

The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements
contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet the
requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in
clauses 9.4.8.4.2 and 9.4.8.4.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds
and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event as per
TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall
be less than T~Measure,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap or NCSG has not
been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

##### 9.4.8.4.5 Scheduling availability during NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements

When any of the conditions in the following clauses is met, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability; otherwise, there is no
scheduling restriction.

##### 9.4.8.4.5.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing inter-RAT measurements in TDD bands on FR1 {#scheduling-availability-of-ue-performing-inter-rat-measurements-in-tdd-bands-on-fr1 .H6}

When the UE performs inter-RAT measurements in a TDD band outside MG and
the E-UTRA carrier is within DL active BWP of the serving cell, the
following restrictions apply on the NR serving cell due to RSRP, RS-SINR
and RSRQ measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols
within EMW duration.

When the UE performs inter-RAT measurement in a TDD band outside MG and
the E-UTRA carrier is outside DL active BWP of the serving cell, the
following restrictions apply on the NR serving cell due to
RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement, when the NR serving cell and E-URTA carrier
are in a band pair for which UE does not have the capability of
supporting *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA*

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on all symbols
within EMW duration.

##### 9.4.8.4.5.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing inter-RAT measurements with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1 {#scheduling-availability-of-ue-performing-inter-rat-measurements-with-a-different-subcarrier-spacing-than-pdschpdcch-on-fr1-1 .H6}

When UE performs inter-RAT measurement outside MG and the E-UTRA carrier
is fully or partially overlapping with the DL active BWP of the serving
cell, for UE which do not support \[*FG32-7\]* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to RSRP/RSRQ/SINR measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on all symbols within EMW duration.

9.4A Inter-RAT measurements for RedCap
--------------------------------------

### 9.4A.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are specified for NR−E-UTRAN FDD and
NR−E-UTRAN TDD measurements and are applicable without an explicit
E-UTRAN neighbour cell list containing physical layer cell identities,
for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured

\- with SA operation mode by PCell with NR−E-UTRAN FDD or TDD
measurement (RSRP, RSRQ, RS-SINR) on E-UTRA non-serving frequency
carrier, and

\- configured with an appropriate measurement gap pattern according to
table 9.1A.2-1 and table 9.1A.2-2.

Parameter T~Inter1\_RedCap~ used in inter-RAT requirements in clause
9.4A is specified in table 9.4A.1-1.

#### 9.4A.2.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure inter-RAT
cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern is scheduled, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable FDD cell within
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ according to the following
expression:

$T_{\text{Identify}\_ RedCap,\ \ E - UTRAN\ FDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1\_ RedCap}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1\_RedCap~ is defined in clause 9.4A.1,

CSSF~interRAT\_RedCap~ = CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is the scaling
factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated
as specified in clause 9.1A.5.2.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in table 9.4A.2.2-1 and table
9.4A.2.2-2 for 2 Rx RedCap UE and 1 Rx RedCap UE, respectively.

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured cells
shall be as specified in clause 10.2A.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2A.3.

#### 9.4A.2.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4A.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The requirements in clause 9.4.2.4.1 shall apply.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

##### 9.4A.2.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and
10.2.5, respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4A.2.4.3.

##### 9.4A.2.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5,
respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN FDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined
in clauses 9.4A.2.2 and 9.4A.2.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5
seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event
as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay
shall be less than T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ provided the timing
to that cell has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap has
not been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

### 9.4A.3 NR − E-UTRAN TDD measurements

#### 9.4A.3.1 Introduction

The requirements are applicable for NR−E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements.

In the requirements, an E-UTRAN TDD cell is considered to be detectable
when:

\- For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.2
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.3
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS 36.133 \[15\],

RS-SINR related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.2.5
are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the corresponding
side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.19 of TS 36.133 \[15\].

\- For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

\- RSRP related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
10.2A.2 are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the
corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS
36.133 \[15\],

\- RSRQ related conditions in the accuracy requirements in clause
10.2A.3 are fulfilled for a corresponding band, together with the
corresponding side conditions in Annex B.2.3 and Annex B.3.3 of TS
36.133 \[15\],

#### 9.4A.3.2 Requirements when no DRX is used

When the UE requires measurement gaps to identify and measure inter-RAT
cells and an appropriate measurement gap pattern is scheduled, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable TDD cell within
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ according to the following
expression:

\- When configuration 0 or configuration 1 in table 9.4A.3.2-1 is
applied,

$T_{\text{Identify}\_ RedCap,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1\_ RedCap}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

> \- When configuration 2 or configuration 3 in table 9.4A.3.2-1 is
> applied,

$T_{\text{Identify}\_ RedCap,\ \ E - UTRAN\ TDD} = T_{\text{BasicIdentify}} \bullet \frac{480}{T_{Inter1\_ RedCap}} \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap} + 240 \bullet \text{CSSF}_{\text{interRAT}\_ RedCap}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{ms}$,

where:

T~BasicIdentify~ = 480 ms,

T~Inter1\_RedCap~ is defined in clause 9.4A.1,

CSSF~interRAT\_RedCap~ = CSSF~within\_gap\_RedCap,i~ is the scaling
factor for the measured inter-RAT E-UTRA carrier *i* which is calculated
as specified in clause 9.1A.5.2.

Identification of a cell shall include detection of the cell and
additionally performing a single measurement with measurement period of
T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined in table 9.4A.3.2-1 and table
9.4A.3.2-2 for 2 Rx RedCap UE and 1 Rx RedCap UE, respectively.

RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements of at least 4 identified E-UTRAN
TDD cells per E-UTRA TDD carrier frequency layer during each layer 1
measurement period, for up to 7 E-UTRA TDD carrier frequency layers.

cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in

#### 9.4A.3.3 Requirements when DRX is used

When DRX is in use and measurement gaps are configured, the UE shall be

If higher layer filtering is used, an additional cell identification
delay can be expected.

For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

\- The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured
cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in
clause 10.2.3. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RS-SINR measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2.5.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

\- The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured
cells shall be as specified in clause 10.2A.2. The NR -- E-UTRAN TDD
RSRQ measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified
in clause 10.2A.3.

#### 9.4A.3.4 Measurement reporting requirements

##### 9.4A.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The requirements in clause 9.4.3.4.1 shall apply.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

##### 9.4A.3.4.2 Event-Triggered Periodic Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and
10.2.5, respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered periodic measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3,
respectively.

The first report in event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.4A.3.4.3.

##### 9.4A.3.4.3 Event-Triggered Reporting

For 2 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP, RSRQ, and
RS-SINR measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.5,
respectively.

For 1 Rx RedCap UE: The reported NR -- E-UTRAN TDD RSRP and RSRQ
measurements contained in event-triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in clauses 10.2A.2 and 10.2A.3, respectively.

The UE shall not send any event-triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where
TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when the
measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or
subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ defined
in clauses 9.4A.3.2 and 9.4A.3.3 without DRX and with DRX, respectively.
When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T~Identify\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5
seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers an event
as per TS 38.331 \[2\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay
shall be less than T~Measure\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN\ TDD~ provided the timing
to that cell has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while measurement gap has
not been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

### 9.4A.4 NR -- E-UTRAN measurements with autonomous gaps

#### 9.4A.4.1 CGI identification of an E-UTRA cell with autonomous gaps

The requirements in this clause apply when the 1Rx RedCap UE or 2Rx
RedCap UE is configured with standalone NR. The UE shall identify and
report the CGI when requested by an NR PCell for the purpose
'*reportCGI*'. The UE may make autonomous gaps in downlink reception and
uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to
clause 5.5.3.1 in TS 38.331 \[2\].

For 2Rx RedCap UE: If autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the
purpose of 'reportCGI', the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell within$T_{\text{identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN}}\ $= 150
ms.

For 1Rx RedCap UE: If autonomous gaps are used for measurement with the
purpose of 'reportCGI', the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of
E-UTRA cell within $T_{\text{identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN}}\ $= 190
ms.

This is the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a new CGI of an
E-UTRA cell, provided that the E-UTRA cell has been already identified
by the UE.

A cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are
fulfilled:

> \- RSRP related side conditions given in Clause 9.1 in \[15\] are
> fulfilled for a corresponding band,
>
> \- SCH\_RP and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 in \[15\] for a
> corresponding band

The MIB of an E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be considered
decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation requirements are met
according to \[25\].

The requirement for identifying a new CGI of an E-UTRA cell within
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI}\text{\_RedCap}\text{,\ E-UTRAN}}$ is applicable
when no DRX is used as well as when any of the DRX cycles specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

#### 9.4A.4.2 CGI reporting delay

The E-UTRA CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command
that will trigger an E-UTRA CGI report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE
to send the measurement report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than
$T_{\text{identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRAN}}$ plus RRC procedure delay
defined in clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\], and an additional 30 ms margin.

#### 9.4A.4.3 CGI reporting scheduling restriction

When a UE is identifying CGI of an E-UTRA FDD cell or E-UTRA TDD cell
with autonomous gaps, within time period
T~identify\_CGI\_RedCap,\ E-UTRA~ specified in clause 9.4A.4.1, the UE
shall be able to transmit at least the number of ACK/NACKs specified in
table 9.4A.4.3-1 on PCell in the frequency range where autonomous gaps
are used, provided that:

\- there is continuous DL data allocation,

\- no DRX cycle is used,

\- no measurement gaps are configured,

\- only one code word is transmitted in each slot,

\- 2 slot ACK/NACK feedback is configured,

\- 20 ms SMTC period is configured.

9.5 L1-RSRP measurements for Reporting
--------------------------------------

### 9.5.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured CSI-RS, SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources for
L1-RSRP. The measurements shall be performed for a serving cell,
including PCell, PSCell, or SCell, on the resources configured for
L1-RSRP measurements within the active BWP. For UE supporting
*bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, the UE shall additionally be
able to perform L1-RSRP measurements for a serving cell, including
PCell, PSCell, or SCell, on the configured SSB resources for L1-RSRP
outside the active BWP, provided that the SSB is within the configured
UE-specific CBW.

For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, the SSB and SMTC in this clause
applies for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if it is not explicitly specified
otherwise. If SSB in the active DL BWP of serving cell *i* is NCD-SSB,
for serving cell *i* the requirements in clause 9.5 apply provided that
serving cell *i* is PCell or activated PSCell.

The UE shall be able to measure all CSI-RS resources and/or SSB
resources of the *nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* and/or *csi-SSB-ResourceSet*
within the *CSI-ResourceConfig* settings configured for L1-RSRP for the
active BWP, provided that the number of resources, including the number
of SSB resources of the cell with PCI different from serving cell
configured for L1-RSRP measurements in clause 9.13, does not exceed the
UE capability indicated by *beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*. If the UE
supports *bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, UE shall be able to
measure the SSB reources of *csi-SSB-ResourceSet* within the
*CSI-ResourceConfig configured outside active BWP,* provided that the
SSB is within the configured UE-specific CBW.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the
*reportConfigType* according to the CSI reporting configuration(s)
(*CSI-ReportConfig*) for the active BWP.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.5.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.5 apply, provided:

> \- The CSI-RS or SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources configured for
> L1-RSRP measurements are measurable.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SSB the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.1 and
10.1.20.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant CSI-RS the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.2 and
10.1.20.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RS\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.2 for a
corresponding band.

A CSI-RS and SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered
measurable when the measurable resource conditions are met for both
CSI-RS resource and SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

In case the SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements outside
SMTCs are overlapped with the PDSCH/PDCCH that is associated to a PCI
different from serving cell, L1-RSRP measurement performance degradation
is expected.

*If groupBasedBeamReporting-r17 is* configured*,* the requirements in
clause 9.5 apply when all SSB resources of *csi-SSB-ResourceSet* or
CSI-RS resources of *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* within the
CSI-Resource*Config* settings are configured for L1-RSRP for the active
BWP are from a serving cell, including a single PCell, PSCell, or SCell
configured for L1-RSRP measurements, when the UE is configured with a
single serving cell (PCell, PSCell, or SCell) in FR2-1.

Unless otherwise stated in other sub-clauses of 9.5,

\- For a UE that supports both *multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*, the
requirements apply when Rx timing difference is up to MRTD as specified
in clause 7.6.8.

**- For a UE which do not support** *rxTimingDiff-r18***, the
requirements apply when Rx timing difference is less than CP.**

### 9.5.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP, unless the UE supports
*bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, provided that the SSB is within
the configured UE-specific CBW.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1 dB step size according to clause 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2 if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If
*nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if
groupBasedBeamReporting is enabled, or if groupBasedBeamReporting-r17
is* configured*,* the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP based reporting
as defined in clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2. The
differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2 dB step size.
The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the measured quantity
is described in clause 10.1.6.

In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

#### 9.5.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1 and
10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send periodic L1-RSRP measurement reports for an
active BWP, unless the UE supports
*bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, provided that the SSB is within
the configured UE-specific CBW.

The UE shall transmit the periodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUCCH over the
air interface according to the periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in
TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in a Semi-Persistent L1-RSRP
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports, if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

*When groupBasedBeamReporting-r17 is not* configured, the UE shall be
capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the configured SSB
resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical layer shall be
capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~.

*When groupBasedBeamReporting-r17 is* configured, the UE shall be
capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the two configured
SSB resource sets for L1-RSRP, and the UE physical layer shall be
capable of reporting group-based L1-RSRP measured over the measurement
period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~.

When there is no L1-RSRP measurement on LTM neighbor cell(s) to measure
within active BWP, the value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~ is
defined in table 9.5.4.1-1 for FR1, the value of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~ is defined in table 9.5.4.1-2 for
FR2 when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured and *if
groupBasedBeamReporting-r17 is not* configured, and defined in table

overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion
within the window W

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all

measurement is 1

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 2, if any symbol of the SSBs from serving cell and
neighbor cell are overlapping or adjacent (in time domain)

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 1, otherwise

\- When number of neighboring cells configured with SSB based L1-RSRP
measurement is more than 1

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 3.

Note: RRM requirements are not applicable when L1 measurement on the
cells with different PCI and LTM L1 measurement on neighbour cells are
both configured.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous conditions.

When UE is configured with aperiodic MUSIM gap and the aperiodic MUSIM
gap is overlapping with SSB resource occasion for L1-RSRP, longer
evaluation period would be expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and SSB resource occasions for
L1-RSRP are fully overlapped with MUSIM gap(s) or fully overlapped with
the union of MUSIM gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies for the SSB
based L1-RSRP measurement.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 9.5.4.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP Reporting

*When groupBasedBeamReporting-r17 is not* configured, the UE shall be
capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the configured
CSI-RS resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical layer shall
be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~.

*When groupBasedBeamReporting-r17 is* configured, the UE shall be
capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the two configured
CSI-RS resource sets for L1-RSRP, and the UE physical layer shall be
capable of reporting group-based L1-RSRP measured over the measurement
period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table
9.5.4.2-1 for FR1 and in table 9.5.4.2-2 for FR2, where

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources, M=1 if higher
layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is configured,
and M=3 otherwise

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources M=1

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The requirements
apply if *qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured for all the resources in
the resource set and for each resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam*
/ N~res\_per\_set~) for table 9.5.4.2-2, where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
*qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured with QCL-TypeD for all resources
in the resource set.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requirements apply provided TCI state is provided for all resources in
the resource set in the MAC CE activating the resource set and for each
resource one RS has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

### 9.5.5 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS and SSB for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB and CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
without measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the
following clauses.

#### 9.5.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1, if UE does not support *rxTimingDiff-r18*, when the SSB for
L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD,
CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, if UE support *rxTimingDiff-r18*, when \[the SSB for L1-RSRP
measurement and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement are
overlapping or partially overlapping in OFDM symbols\],

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB from cell with additional PCI for BFD, CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period
for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

#### 9.5.5.2 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP

The SSB mentioned in this clause can be associated with either the
serving cell PCI or a PCI different from serving cell PCI or
intra-frequency neighbor cell(s) configured with L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency neighbor cell(s) configured with L1-RSRP measurement
without gap.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is
not required to receive CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement has same
SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the UE shall be able to perform
CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement has
different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the UE shall be able
to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions according to its
capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE
shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement without any
restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for
CBD measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when
beam failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the
same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource
set configured with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement without any restriction.

For UE incapable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18* and for UE
capable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

\- For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement fully
or partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement without gap, UE is not required to receive CSI-RS
for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

\- For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement fully or partially
overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbor cell
for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap, if CSI-RS and SSB have different SCS and UE
does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is required
to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SSB.
Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

\- For FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SSB.
Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2-1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement on the one CC is in
the same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP
measurement on the same CC, UE supporting
*schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18* according to the conditions
described in clause 3.6.19 shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for
L1-RSRP measurement without restriction when the following conditions
are met:

\- Both CSI-RSs are not in any CSI-RS resource set with repetition ON,
and

\- One CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to 38.214 clause 5.1.5, and

\- the other CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to 38.214 clause 5.1.5, and

\- Resources of the active TCI states of the two PDSCHs, or QCL sources
of the default QCL assumption, or the active TCI state of PDSCH and QCL
source of the default QCL assumption have been reported as a resource
group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

### 9.5.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

with the same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.5.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] and do not
support *rxTimingDiff-r18*, the following restrictions apply due to
L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI \[on symbols that are
overlapping or partially overlapping with the symbols corresponding to\]
the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed

partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is
performed apply to all serving cells in the same band on the symbols
that fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are
no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other
bands than the bands in which the serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement
is performed is configured.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 serving cell(s) in different band(s),
provided that UE is capable of independent beam management on this FR2
band pair. Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is
configured with different numerology between SSB on one FR2 band and
data on the other FR2 band provided the UE is configured for IBM
operation for the band pair.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR1 serving cell(s).

### 9.5.7 Minimum requirement at transitions

For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, when the L1-RSRP measurement
transitions from measurements performed on CD-SSB to measurements
performed on NCD-SSB or vice versa due to BWP switching during one
measurement period, the UE shall use a L1-RSRP measurement period that
is the maximum of the L1-RSRP measurement period corresponding to the
first SSB type and the second SSB type after the BWP switching.

Subsequent to the above-mentioned measurement periods, the L1-RSRP
measurement period requirements are based on the SSB type after the BWP
switch.

9.5A L1-RSRP measurements for Reporting under CCA
-------------------------------------------------

### 9.5A.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured SSB resources for L1-RSRP. The measurements
shall be performed for a serving cell under CCA operating mode,
including PCell, PSCell, or SCell, on the resources configured for
L1-RSRP measurements within the active BWP.

The UE shall be able to measure all SSB resources of the
*csi-SSB-ResourceSet* within the *CSI-ResourceConfig* settings
configured for L1-RSRP for the active BWP, provided that the number of
resources does not exceed the UE capability indicated by
*beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the
*reportConfigType* according to the CSI reporting configuration(s)
(*CSI-ReportConfig*) for the active BWP.

During EN-DC operation in FR-1, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching, an additional delay can be expected.

The requirements in clause 9.5A apply for any *channelAccessMode*
configuration \[TS 38.331, 2\].

In the requirements of clause 9.5A, the term SSB occasion not available
at the UE refers to when the SSB is configured by gNB in a cell on a
carrier frequency subject to CCA, but the first two successive candidate
SSB positions for the same SS/PBCH block index within the set of
configured SSB are not available at the UE due to DL CCA failures at gNB
during the corresponding evaluation or measurement period; otherwise the
SSB occasion is considered as available at the UE.

### 9.5A.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.5A apply, provided:

> \- The SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements are
> measurable.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SSB the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.19.1 for FR1 for
a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when the measurable resource conditions are met for SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

### 9.5A.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1 dB step size according to clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2-2 if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If
*nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if
groupBasedBeamReporting is enabled,* the UE shall use differential
L1-RSRP based reporting as defined in clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and 10.1.20
for FR2-2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2
dB step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in clause 10.1.6.

During EN-DC operation, for FR1, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected.

#### 9.5A.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1 and
10.1.20 for FR2-2, respectively.

The UE shall only send periodic L1-RSRP measurement reports for an
active BWP.

The UE shall transmit the periodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUCCH over the
air interface according to the periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in
TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5A.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in a Semi-Persistent L1-RSRP
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2-2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

When CCA is used on target frequency, if UE cannot transmit HARQ-ACK for
the MAC CE activation command due to UL CCA failure, the UE shall not
perform MAC CE activation at the MAC action time based on the originally
scheduled HARQ-ACK transmission time specified in clause 5.2.1.5.2 in TS
38.214 \[26\].

When CCA is used on target frequency, if UE cannot transmit HARQ-ACK for
the MAC CE deactivation command due to UL CCA failure, the UE shall
perform MAC CE deactivation at the MAC action time based on the
originally scheduled HARQ-ACK transmission time specified in clause
5.2.1.5.2 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5A.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,

L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1
and 10.1.20 for FR2-2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5A.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5A.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CCA~ is defined in
table 9.5A.4.1-1 for FR1, and in table 9.5A.4.1-2 for FR2-2, where,

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- N = 8

For FR1, for a UE supporting \[*support for Case 1 requirements*\] and
when concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a
UE supporting \[*support for Case 2 requirements*\] and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with NCSG measurement gap(s) are configured, or a UE
supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and when concurrent gaps are
configured,

\- P value for an SSB resource to be measured is defined as N~total~ /
N~outside\_MG~

> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1~, xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
> the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE **measurement gaps** or
> NCSGs and per-FR **measurement gaps** or NCSGs, and, in case of
> Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement
> gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and starting at the
> beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions within the
window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **GAP** occasion within the window W

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.

Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*\[support for Case 1 requirements\]* nor *\[support for Case 2
requirements\]* or when neither of the above configurations applies,
i.e. concurrent measurement gaps, concurrent measurement gap(s) with
Pre-MG(s) and concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s),

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the SSB.

For FR2-2,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
SSB is not overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is not overlapped with measurement
gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P is
$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ =
MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when S SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SSB~ \<MGRP)
and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\- P is
$\ \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion
is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

> Where:

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

T~SSB~ = *ssb-periodicityServingCell*

T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC1 period or SMTC2 period if
configured

\- When a measurement gap only is configured,

\- an SSB is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it overlaps a
measurement gap occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG, an SSB is only considered to be
overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

\- When NCSG only is configured,

\- an SSB is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it overlaps the
VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, and

\- xRP = VIRP

> \- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with
> Pre-MG(s) or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are
> configured, an SSB or an SMTC occasion is not considered to be
> overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap occasion is dropped according
> to clause 9.1.8.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

UE shall report RSRP\_0 (Not valid) if L1\>L1~max~, where L1 and L1~max~
are defined in table 9.5A.4.1-1.

### 9.5A.5 Measurement restriction for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for L1-RSRP without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

#### 9.5A.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

When the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

> \- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
> able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any
> restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure SSB for L1-RSRP measurement.

### 9.5A.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.5A.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB configured as RS for L1-RSRP measurement with the same
SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.5A.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols corresponding
to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier
aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other bands than the
bands in which the serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed
is configured.

#### 9.5A.6.3 Void

#### 9.5A.6.3A Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on serving cell(s) under CCA.

#### 9.5A.6.3B Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2-2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement
on an FR2-2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
> PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on

\- symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP
measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the periodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the semi-persistent CSI-RS resource
configured for L1-RSRP measurement when the resource is activated,
and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the aperiodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement when the reporting is triggered.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2-2 is performed, the
scheduling restrictions on serving cell where L1-RSRP measurement is
performed apply to all serving cells in the band on the symbols that
fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols.

For FR2-2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR1 serving cell(s) under CCA.

9.5B L1-RSRP measurements for Reporting for RedCap
--------------------------------------------------

### 9.5B.1 Introduction

The applicability of the requirements for performing L1-RSRP
measurements for reporting in subclause 9.5B is defined in clause 3.6.
The SSB and SMTC in this clause applies for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if
it is not additional specified.

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured CSI-RS, SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources for
L1-RSRP. The measurements shall be performed for PCell, on the resources
configured for L1-RSRP measurements within the active BWP.

The UE shall be able to measure all CSI-RS resources and/or SSB
resources of the *nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* and/or *csi-SSB-ResourceSet*
within the CSI-Resource*Config* settings configured for L1-RSRP for the
active BWP, provided that the number of resources does not exceed the UE
capability indicated by *beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the
*reportConfigType* according to the CSI reporting configuration(s)
(*CSI-ReportConfig*) for the active BWP.

### 9.5B.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.5B apply, provided:

\- The CSI-RS or SSB or CSI-RS and SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP
measurements are measurable.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SSB the following conditions are met:

For 1 Rx RedCap:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1A.14.1 for FR1,
respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

For 2 Rx RedCap:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.1 and
10.1.20.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant CSI-RS the following conditions are met:

For 1 Rx RedCap:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1A.14.2 for FR1,
respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RS\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.2 for a
corresponding band.

For 2 Rx RedCap:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.2 and
10.1.20.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RS\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.2 for a
corresponding band.

A CSI-RS and SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered
measurable when the measurable resource conditions are met for both
CSI-RS resource and SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

### 9.5B.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1A.14 for
FR1, for 1 Rx RedCap, and clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and clause 10.1.20 for
FR2 for 2 Rx RedCap, if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If
*nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if
groupBasedBeamReporting is enabled,* the UE shall use differential
L1-RSRP based reporting as defined in clause 10.1A.14 for FR1, for 1 Rx
RedCap, and clause 10.1.19 for FR1 and clause10.1.20 for FR2 for 2 Rx
RedCap. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2dB
step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in clause 10.1.6.

PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.5B.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting

### 9.5B.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5B.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_RedCap~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB~ is defined in table
9.5B.4.1-1 for FR1 and table 9.5B.4.1-2 for FR2, for 2 Rx RedCap, and
table 9.5B.4.1-3 for FR1 for 1 Rx RedCap, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise.

\- N= 8.

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
SSB is not overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when SSB is not overlapped with measurement
gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC period (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P is
$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ =
MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when S SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SSB~ \<MGRP)
and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\- P is
$\ \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion
is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

Where:

\- T~SSB~ = *ssb-periodicityServingCell*

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 9.5B.4.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured CSI-RS resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_RedCap~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_RedCap~ is defined
in table 9.5B.4.2-1 for FR1 and in table 9.5B.4.2-2 for FR2, for 2 Rx
RedCap, and in table 9.5B.4.2-3 for 1 Rx RedCap, where

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources, M=1 if higher
layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is configured,
and M=3 otherwise

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources M=1

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The requirements

TCI state is provided with QCL-TypeD for all resources in the resource
set in the MAC CE activating the resource set.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources in a resource set configured with

to meet the accuracy requirements in clauses 10.1.19.2 and 10.1.20.2 if
number of resources in the resource set is smaller than
*maxNumberRxBeam*. The requirements apply provided *qcl-info* is
configured with QCL-TypeD for all resources in the resource set.

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P=1, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with measurement gap and also not
overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when CSI-RS is
partially overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is not overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

CSI-RS is not overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P=P~sharing\ factor~, when CSI-RS is not overlapped with measurement
gap and CSI-RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ =
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P=1, when aperiodic CSI-RS resource is not overlapped with
measurement gap

\-
P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when CSI-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and CSI-RS is

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

and T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
CSI-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)
and CSI-RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

measurement outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,

indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

Where:

T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period.

T~CSI-RS~ = the periodicity of CSI-RS configured for L1-RSRP measurement

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

### 9.5B.5 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS and SSB for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB and CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
without measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the
following clauses.

#### 9.5B.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

> \- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
> able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any
> restriction;

\- If UE does not *support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC, UE is required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP
measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 9.5B.5.2 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is
not required to receive CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the
UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE
shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement without any
restriction.

### 9.5B.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.5B.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For FD-FDD and TDD RedCap UEs, there are no scheduling restrictions due
to L1-RSRP measurement performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as RS for
L1-RSRP measurement with the same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

For HD-FDD RedCap UE, scheduling restrictions apply for transmission on
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS during the CBD evaluation period, as CBD evaluation is
prioritized over UL transmission. The CBD evaluation period equals the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_RedCap~ in
case L1-RSRP measurement is performed on SSB as defined in clause
9.5B.4.1, or T~L1‑RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI‑RS\_RedCap~ in case
L1-RSRP measurement is performed on CSI-RS and/or SSB as defined in
clause 9.5B.4.1.

#### 9.5B.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- For FD-FDD and TDD RedCap UEs, the UE is not expected to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for
CQI on symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

\- For HD-FDD RedCap UE, scheduling restrictions apply for transmission
on PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS during the CBD evaluation period, as CBD evaluation
is prioritized over UL transmission. The CBD evaluation period equals
the measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_RedCap~
in case L1-RSRP measurement is performed on SSB as defined in clause
9.5B.4.1, or T~L1‑RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI‑RS\_RedCap~ in case
L1-RSRP measurement is performed on CSI-RS and/or SSB as defined in
clause 9.5B.4.1.

#### 9.5B.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement.

\- For the case where RS for L1-RSRP measurement is CSI-RS which is
QCLed with active TCI state for PDCCH/PDSCH and not in a CSI-RS resource
set with repetition ON, and N=1 applies as specified in clause 9.5B.4.2

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed based on the CSI-RS.

\- Otherwise

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
> PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on

\- symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP
measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the periodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the semi-persistent CSI-RS resource
configured for L1-RSRP measurement when the resource is activated,
and/or

\- symbols corresponding to the aperiodic CSI-RS resource configured for
L1-RSRP measurement when the reporting is triggered.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

A CSI-RS and SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP shall be considered
measurable when the measurable resource conditions are met for both
CSI-RS resource and SSB resource.

Requirements are defined for periodic, semi-persistent and aperiodic
resources.

### 9.5C.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1 dB step size according to clause 10.1.19C for
FR1 if *nrofReportedRS is configured to one.* If *nrofReportedRS is
configured to be larger than one, or if groupBasedBeamReporting is
enabled,* the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP based reporting as
defined in clause 10.1.19C for FR1. The differential L1-RSRP is
quantized to a 4-bit value with 2 dB step size. The mapping between the
reported L1-RSRP value and the measured quantity is described in clause
10.1.6.

#### 9.5C.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.19C.

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.19C.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement reports, if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.5C.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.5C.4.1 SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_SAN~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_SAN~ is defined in
table 9.5C.4.1-1 for FR1, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of SSB resource occasions that are not overlapped with any
**measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W,
if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

**-** P~sharing\ factor~ **= 3.**

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

  NOTE: T~SSB~ = *ssb-periodicityServingCell* is the periodicity of the SSB-Index configured for L1-RSRP measurement. T~DRX~ is the DRX cycle length. T~Report~ is configured periodicity for reporting.   

9.5C.4.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured CSI-RS resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_SAN~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table
9.5C.4.2-1 for FR1, where

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources, M=1 if higher
layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is configured,
and M=3 otherwise

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources M=1

\- P value for a CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W, if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17*
and LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- **T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS**.**

**-** P~sharing\ factor~ **= 3.**

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the
UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE

performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as RS for L1-RSRP measurement
with the same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.5C.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured

configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_SAN~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_SAN~ is defined in
table 9.5C.7.1-1, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is same as N~outside\_MG~

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

**-** P~sharing\ factor~ **= 3.**

### 9.5C.7.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP Reporting

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the
configured CSI-RS resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_SAN~.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table
9.5C.7.2-1, where

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources, M=1 if higher
layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is configured,
and M=3 otherwise

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources M=1

\- P value for a CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of SSB resource occasions that are not overlapped with any
**measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W,
if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction-r17* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- **T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS**.**

**-** P~sharing\ factor~ **= 3.**

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

Otherwise, for UE with one or multiple omni-directional antennas

For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and when concurrent gaps are
configured,

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~

> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max

or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

concurrent gaps are not configured,

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous conditions.

### 9.5D.5 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS and SSB for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB and CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
without measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the
following clauses.

#### 9.5D.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1, when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 9.5D.5.2 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP

The SSB mentioned in this clause can be associated with the serving cell
PCI.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement, the
UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-RSRP
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE
shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-RSRP measurement without any
restriction.

### 9.5D.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions described in the following clauses
apply when the UE is performing L1-RSRP measurement on serving cell, and
UE is receiving PDCCH/PDSCH from serving cell and/or cell(s) with
different PCI.

#### 9.5D.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as RS for L1-RSRP measurement
with the same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.5D.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols corresponding
to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

9.6 NE-DC: Measurements
-----------------------

### 9.6.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for UE supporting dual connectivity
with NR PCell and E-UTRA FDD or TDD PSCell. The requirements apply to
UEs that have been configured with NE-DC.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.6.2 SFTD Measurements

#### 9.6.2.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for reporting of
SFN and frame time difference between NR PCell and E-UTRA PSCell in
RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements comprise measurement reporting
delay and measurement accuracy. The overall measurement reporting delay
includes an RRC procedure delay specified in TS 38.331 \[2\], and the
SFTD measurement reporting delay specified below.

#### 9.6.2.2 SFTD Measurement requirements

When no DRX is used in either of the NR PCell and E-UTRA PSCell, the
physical layer measurement period of the SFTD measurement shall be
T~measure\_SFTD1~ = max(0.2, 5 \* SMTC period) s.

When DRX is used in either of the NR PCell or the E-UTRA PSCell, or in
both PCell and PSCell, the physical layer measurement period
(T~measure\_SFTD1~) of the SFTD measurement shall be as specified in
table 9.6.2.2-1.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

If E-UTRA PSCell is changed without changing carrier frequency of E-UTRA
PSCell while the UE is performing SFTD measurements, the UE shall still
meet SFTD measurement and accuracy requirements for the new E-UTRA
PSCell. In this case the UE shall restart the SFTD measurement, and the
total physical layer measurement period shall not exceed
T~measure\_SFTD2~ as defined by the following expression:

T~measure\_SFTD2~ = (M+1)\*(T~measure\_SFTD1~) +
M\*T~PSCell\_change\_NEDC~

where:

M is the number of times the E-UTRA PSCell is changed over the
measurement period (T~measure\_SFTD2~), and

T~PSCell\_change\_NEDC~ is the time necessary to change the E-UTRA
PSCell; it can be up to 25 ms.

If PCell is changed, or if E-UTRA PSCell is changed to a different
carrier frequency, the UE shall terminate the SFTD measurement.

The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement when DRX is used as
well as when no DRX is used shall be as specified in clause 10.1.21.1.

9.7 Cross Link Interference measurements
----------------------------------------

### 9.7.1 Introduction

The UE capable of performing CLI measurements shall be able to measure
SRS-RSRP and CLI-RSSI which are defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] within active
DL BWP. The measurements requirements in this clause apply for TDD mode
only.

CLI measurements are only applicable for RRC\_CONNECTED intra-frequency:

\- when SRS-RSRP measurement resource is fully confined within BW of DL
active BWP

\- when CLI-RSSI measurement resource is configured within active BWP

When the UE measures SRS-RSRP and CLI-RSSI, a constant offset relative
to the downlink reference timing in the serving cell shall be applied.
The constant offset value is derived by UE implementation and shall be
at least Tc\*N~TA\_offset~.

For performing CLI measurement in FR2, UE can assume the configured CLI
measurement resources are QCL-ed with TypeD to one of the latest
received PDSCH and the latest monitored CORESET.

CLI measurement requirements defined in clause 9.7 are applicable if

\- CLI measurement is not performed on an NR carrier in the same band as
E-UTRA serving carrier; and

\- UE supports simultaneous Rx/Tx for inter-band CA, inter-band EN-DC,
inter-band NE-DC, and NR-DC.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.7.2 SRS-RSRP measurements

#### 9.7.2.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform SRS-RSRP
measurements of configured *srs-ResourceConfigCLI*. The requirements
apply when the subcarrier spacing for SRS-RSRP measurement resource
configuration is the same as the subcarrier spacing of the active DL BWP
of serving cell. The UE is not required to measure SRS using different
SCS compared to the downlink active BWP SCS of the same carrier.

#### 9.7.2.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.7.2 apply, provided:

\- SRS resources configured for SRS-RSRP measurements are measurable.

An SRS resource configured for SRS-RSRP shall be considered measurable
when for each relevant SRS the following conditions are met:

\- SRS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.22.1 for FR1
and FR2 for a corresponding band,

\- SRS\_RP and SRS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.7 for a corresponding
band.

#### 9.7.2.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send SRS-RSRP reports only for report configurations
according to *reportType* which is *cliPeriodical* or
*cliEventTriggered* when SRS-RSRP report is configured.

The UE shall report the SRS-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1 dB step size according to clause 10.1.22.1 for
FR1 and FR2.

##### 9.7.2.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported SRS-RSRP measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.1.

##### 9.7.2.3.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting 

Reported SRS-RSRP measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.22.1.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.7.2.3.3.

##### 9.7.2.3.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported SRS-RSRP measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.1.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report on.

#### 9.7.2.4 Measurement capability

The UE shall be capable of performing SRS-RSRP measurements on the SRS
resources configured for measurement, provided that the number of SRS to
be monitored by UE does not exceed 8 within a slot, and the total number
of SRSs to be monitored by the UE does not exceed 32.

#### 9.7.2.5 SRS-RSRP measurement period

The UE shall be capable of performing SRS-RSRP measurement based on the
configured SRS resource, and the UE shall be capable of reporting
SRS-RSRP measured over measurement period of
T~SRS\_RSRP\_measurement\_period~ for FR1 and FR2.

### 9.7.3 CLI-RSSI measurements

#### 9.7.3.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform CLI-RSSI
measurement of configured *rssi-ResourceConfigCLI*. The subcarrier
spacing for CLI-RSSI measurement resource configuration can be same or
different from the subcarrier spacing of active BWP. UE shall perform
CLI-RSSI measurement with the SCS of the active BWP.

#### 9.7.3.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.7.3 apply, provided:

\- The measurement resources configured for CLI-RSSI measurements are
measurable.

A measurement resource configured for CLI-RSSI shall be considered
measurable when for each relevant CLI-RSSI resource the following
conditions are met:

\- CLI-RSSI related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.22.2 for FR1
and FR2 for a corresponding band.

#### 9.7.3.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send CLI-RSSI reports only for report configurations
according to *reportType* which is *cliPeriodical* or
*cliEventTriggered* when CLI-RSSI report is configured.

The UE shall report the CLI-RSSI value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-100, -25\] dBm with 1 dB step size according to clause 10.1.22.2 for
FR1 and FR2.

##### 9.7.3.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CLI-RSSI measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.2.

##### 9.7.3.3.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting 

Reported CLI-RSSI measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.22.2.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.7.3.3.3.

##### 9.7.3.3.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported CLI-RSSI measurements contained in periodically triggered
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.22.2.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criteria is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report on.

#### 9.7.3.4 Measurement capability

The UE shall be capable of performing CLI-RSSI measurement based on the
configured resource, provided that the maximum number of CLI-RSSI
measurement resources for the UE does not exceed 64.

#### 9.7.3.5 CLI-RSSI measurement period

The UE shall be capable of performing CLI-RSSI measurement based on the
configured measurement resource within
T~CLI\_RSSI\_measurement\_period~. The UE shall be able to provide a
single RSSI sample for each measurement resource configured for CLI-RSSI
measurement occurring with a configured periodicity. The CLI-RSSI
measurement period T~CLI\_RSSI\_measurement\_period~ corresponds to the
CLI-RSSI measurement resource periodicity, which is configured for by
higher layers via *RSSI-PeriodicityAndOffset*.

If the CLI-RSSI measurement resources configured for measurement are
partially or fully overlapping with SMTC window, SSB or CSI-RS
configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement or measurement gaps,
requirements are not specified for T~CLI\_RSSI\_measurement\_period.~

### 9.7.4 Scheduling availability of UE during CLI measurements

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing CLI
measurements which are SRS-RSRP and CLI-RSSI are described in the
following clause.

#### 9.7.4.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurement on FR1

The following scheduling restriction applies due to CLI measurements.

partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions on serving cell where CLI measurements are
performed apply on all serving cells in the same band on the symbols
that fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

#### 9.7.4.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to CLI measurements.

kHz subcarrier spacing.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on OFDM symbols on
which the UE performs CLI measurements, and on 2 data symbols before an
OFDM symbol used for CLI measurements for 120 kHz subcarrier spacing.

\- For the UE which does not support *cli-SRS-RSRP-FDM\_DL*, the UE is
not expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI
on OFDM symbols on which the UE performs SRS-RSRP measurements, and on 2
data symbols before an OFDM symbol used for SRS-RSRP measurements for
120 kHz subcarrier spacing.

\- For the UE which does not support *cli-RSSI-FDM-DL*, the UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on
OFDM symbols on which the UE performs CLI-RSSI measurements, and on 2
data symbols before an OFDM symbol used for CLI-RSSI measurements for
120 kHz subcarrier spacing.

When TDD intra-band carrier aggregation is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where CLI measurements are performed apply
on all serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

measure interference on corresponding NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM resources if
configured, provided that the number of resources does not exceed the UE
capability indicated by *beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*. If the UE supports
*bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, UE shall be able to measure the
SSB reources of *csi-SSB-ResourceSet* within the *CSI-ResourceConfig
configured outside active BWP,* provided that the SSB is within the
configured UE-specific CBW.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the

layer parameter *smtc1*.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

When UE is configured with aperiodic MUSIM gap and the aperiodic MUSIM
gap is overlapping with CSI-RS resource occasion for L1-SINR, longer
evaluation period would be expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and CSI-RS resource occasions
for L1-SINR are fully overlapped with MUSIM gap(s) or fully overlapped
with the union of MUSIM gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies for the
CSI-RS based L1-SINR measurement.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous conditions.

9.8.4.2 L1-SINR reporting with SSB based CMR and dedicated IMR
configured

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements with the SSB
configured as CMR and dedicated resource configured as IMR for L1-SINR
computation, in which the NZP-CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource configured as
dedicated IMR shall be 1-to-1 mapped to SSB configured as CMR, with the
same periodicity. The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
L1-SINR measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CMR\_IMR~.

The requirements in this clause are not applicable if NZP-CSI-RS or
CSI-IM resource configured as dedicated IMR is scheduled with different
periodicity as SSB configured as CMR.

The value of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CMR\_IMR~ is defined
in table 9.8.4.2-1 for FR1 and in table 9.8.4.2-2 for FR2 when
*highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured, and defined in table
9.8.4.2-3 for FR2 power class 6 UE when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is
configured, where

For the value of M

\- For periodic or semi-persistent NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource as
dedicated IMR, M=1 if the higher layer parameters
*timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* and/or
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured, and M=3
otherwise;

For the value of N in FR2

\- N = 2, 4 or 6 in FR2-1 for UE supporting
*fastBeamSweepingMultiRx-r1*8, according to the conditions described in
clause 3.6.19,

\- N = 8 otherwise.

P is defined as the maximum value between P~CMR~ and P~IMR~, i.e., P =
max(P~CMR~, P~IMR~), where

\- the value of P~CMR~ shall be derived in the same way as the value of
P used for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement in clause 9.5.4.1, in which the
occasions and period of the SSB for CMR shall be used instead.

\- the value of P~IMR~ shall be derived in the same way as the value of
P used for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement in clause 9.5.4.2, in which
the occasions and period of the NZP CSI-RS for NZP-IMR or CSI-IM for
ZP-IMR shall be used instead.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For L1-SINR measurement with SSB as CMR and CSI-RS or CSI-IM as IMR, the
requirement shall apply if the CSI-RS is configured as IMR with
repetition field as "repetition = OFF" or CSI-IM is configured as IMR.

For L1-SINR measurement with SSB as CMR and CSI-RS/CSI-IM as IMR, no
requirement shall apply if SSB occasions for CMR or CSI-RS/CSI-IM
occasions for IMR are fully overlapped with the configured measurement
gap

#### 9.8.4.3 L1-SINR reporting with CSI-RS based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements with the
CSI-RS resource configured as CMR and dedicated resource configured as
IMR for L1-SINR computation, in which the NZP-CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource
configured as dedicated IMR shall be 1-to-1 mapped to CSI-RS resource
configured as CMR, with the same periodicity. The UE physical layer
shall be capable of reporting L1-SINR measured over the measurement
period of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_IMR~.

The requirements in this clause are not applicable if NZP-CSI-RS or
CSI-IM resource configured as dedicated IMR is scheduled with different
periodicity as CSI-RS resource configured as CMR.

The value of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_IMR~ is
defined in table 9.8.4.3-1 for FR1 and in table 9.8.4.3-2 for FR2, where

For the value of M,

\- M=1 shall be applied if

\- aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS as CMR or dedicated IMR, or

\- aperiodic CSI-IMR as dedicated IMR, or

\- periodic and semi-persistent NZP-CSI-RS as CMR or dedicated IMR and
the higher layer parameters *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
and/or *timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured, or

\- periodic and semi-persistent CSI-IM as dedicated IMR and the higher
layer parameters *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* and/or
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured;

\- M=3 otherwise.

For the value of N in FR2

> \- For periodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
> with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
> requirements apply if *qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured for all
> the resources in the resource set and for each resource one RS has
> QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For periodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON,
N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam* / N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
*qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* is configured for all resources in the resource
set.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requirements apply provided TCI state is provided for all resources in
the resource set in the MAC CE activating the resource set and for each
resource has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For semi-persistent CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON,
N=ceil(*maxNumberRxBeam* / N~res\_per\_set~), where N~res\_per\_set~ is
number of resources in the resource set. The requirements apply provided
TCI state is provided for all resources in the resource set in the MAC
CE activating the resource set.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to OFF, N=1. The
requriements apply provided *qcl-info* is configured for all resources
in the resource set and for each resource has QCL-TypeD with

\- SSB for L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, or

\- another CSI-RS in resource set configured with repetition ON.

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR in a resource set configured
with higher layer parameter *repetition* set to ON, N=1. UE is not
required to meet the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.28.1 and
10.1.28.3 if number of resources in the resource set is smaller than
*maxNumberRxBeam*. The requriements apply provided *qcl-info* is
configured for all resources in the resource set.

P is defined as the maximum value between P~CMR~ and P~IMR~, i.e., P =
max(P~CMR~, P~IMR~), where

\- The value of P~CMR~ and P~IMR~ shall be derived in the same way as
the value of P used for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement in clause
9.5.4.2, in which the occasions and period of the CSI-RS for CMR and NZP
CSI-RS for NZP-IMR or CSI-IM for ZP-IMR shall be used instead
respectively.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-RS as IMR, the
requirement shall apply only if CSI-RS resources as CMR and IMR are
configured with the same repetition field and the number of CSI-RS
resources in the resource sets for CMR and IMR are same.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-IM as IMR, the
requirement shall apply only if the number of CSI-RS resources in the
resource set for CMR and the number of CSI-IM resources in the resource
set for IMR are same.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-RS/CSI-IM as IMR, no
requirement shall apply if CSI-RS occasions for CMR or CSI-RS/CSI-IM
occasions for IMR are fully overlapped with the configured measurement
gap.

### 9.8.5 Measurement restriction for L1-SINR measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring L1-SINR without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS/CSI-IM measurements with measurement restrictions as described in
the following clauses.

#### 9.8.5.1 Measurement restriction if SSB configured for L1-SINR Measurement

For FR1, when the SSB configured as CMR for L1-SINR measurement is in
the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-SINR measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-SINR measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-SINR measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-SINR measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB configured as CMR for L1-SINR measurement on one
CC is in the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or
L1-SINR measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE
is required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-SINR measurement
and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement
is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, there is no measurement restriction allowed when the network
configures mixed numerology between SSB configured as CMR for L1-SINR
measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or
L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

For FR2, for UE incapable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*
and for UE capable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,when the
SSB configured as CMR for L1-SINR measurement on one CC fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is required to
measure one of but not both SSB for L1-SINR measurement and SSB for
L1-RSRP measurement on neighbor cell. Longer measurement period for SSB
based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 9.8.5.2 Measurement restriction if CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement
is in the same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement, UE is not required to receive CSI-RS for L1-SINR
measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement
has same SCS than CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement, the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement
has different SCS than CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR me

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-SINR
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-SINR
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-SINR
measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement on one CC is
in the same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, or in the
same symbol as SSB for CBD measurement on the same CC or different CCs
in the same band when beam failure is detected, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement and SSB.
Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-SINR measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement on one CC is
in the same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or
L1-SINR measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based L1-SINR measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource
set configured with repetition ON, or

\- The CSI-RS or the other CSI-RS is configured as dedicated IMR for
L1-SINR computation with SSB as CMR, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed with respect to QCL-TypeD, or the
QCL information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS configured for
L1-SINR measurement without any restriction.

For UE incapable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18* and for UE
capable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

\- For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR
measurement fully or partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from
candidate LTM neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an
SSB.

\- For FR1, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency
L1-RSRP measurement without gap, if CSI-RS and SSB have different SCS
and UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-SINR measurement
is expected, and no requirements are defined.

\- For FR2, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement on one CC
fully or partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate
LTM neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-SINR measurement
is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the UE is indicated with two TCI states for simultaneous
PDSCH reception, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement on
one CC is in the same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the
same band, the UE supporting *schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r1*8
according to the conditions described in clause 3.6.19 shall be able to
measure the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement without any
restriction under the following conditions:

\- Both CSI-RSs are not in any CSI-RS resource set with repetition ON,

\- One CSI-RS has same QCL source as either,

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to 38.214 clause 5.1.5, and

\- the other CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to 38.214 clause 5.1.5.

\- Resources of the active TCI states of the two PDSCHs, and or QCL
sources of the default QCL assumption, or the active TCI state of PDSCH
and QCL source of the default QCL assumption have been reported as a
resource group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

#### 9.8.5.3 Measurement restriction if CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement
is in the same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement, UE is not required to measure CSI-IM for L1-SINR
measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR
measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement on one CC is
in the same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, or in the
same symbol as SSB for CBD measurement on the same CC or different CCs
in the same band when beam failure is detected, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-IM for L1-SINR measurement and SSB.
Longer measurement period for L1-SINR measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement on one CC is
in the same OFDM symbol as the CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or
L1-SINR measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-IM for L1-SINR measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
L1-SINR measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS in a resource set configured with repetition ON, or

\- The CSI-IM or the CSI-RS is configured as dedicated IMR for L1-SINR
computation with SSB as CMR, or

\- The CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The CMR for L1-SINR measurement and the CSI-RS are not QCL-ed w.r.t.
QCL-TypeD, or the QCL information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-IM configured for
L1-SINR measurement without any restriction.

For UE incapable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18* and for UE
capable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

\- For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR
measurement fully or partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from
candidate LTM neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap, UE is not required to
receive CSI-IM for L1-SINR measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an
SSB.

\- For FR2, when the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement on one CC
fully or partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate
LTM neighbor cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-IM based L1-SINR measurement
is expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 9.8.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-SINR measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-SINR
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.8.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-SINR measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement with the
same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.8.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-SINR
measurement based on SSB configured for L1-SINR measurement. For UEs
which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the
following restrictions apply due to L1-SINR measurement based on SSB
configured for L1-SINR measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking /CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be
measured for L1-SINR measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-SINR measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions on serving cell where L1-SINR measurement is
performed apply to all serving cells in the same band on the symbols
that fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided

When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are
no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other
bands than the bands in which the serving cell where L1-SINR measurement
is performed is configured.

9.8.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement on
FR2

\- Resources of the active TCI states for the two PDSCHs have been
reported as a resource group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

\- Otherwise

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the symbols to be
measured for L1-SINR for FR2 power class 6 UE which is not configured
with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*, and for the UE not supporting FR2 power
class 6;

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the symbols to be
measured for L1-SINR, and on 1 data symbol before symbols to be measured
for L1-SINR and 1 data symbol after symbols to be measured for L1-SINR
for FR2 power class 6 UE configured with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on serving cell where L1-SINR measurement is performed
apply to all serving cells in the band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

for the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and

measurement.

#### 9.8.6.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
L1-SINR measurement performed on FR2 serving cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
L1-SINR measurement performed on FR1 serving cell(s).

### 9.8.7 Minimum requirement at transitions

For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, when the L1-SINR measurement
transitions from measurements performed on CD-SSB to measurements
performed on NCD-SSB or vice versa due to BWP switching during one
measurement period, the UE shall use a L1-SINR measurement period that
is the maximum of the L1-SINR measurement period corresponding to the
first SSB type and the second SSB type after the BWP switching.

Subsequent to the above-mentioned measurement periods, the L1-SINR
measurement period requirements are based on the SSB type after the BWP
switch.

9.8D L1-SINR measurements for Reporting for ATG
-----------------------------------------------

configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-SINR value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-23, 40\] dB with 0.5 dB step size if *nrofReportedRS is configured to
one.* If *nrofReportedRS is configured to be larger than one, or if
groupBasedBeamReporting is enabled,* the UE shall use differential
L1-SINR based reporting. The differential L1-SINR is quantized to a
4-bit value with 1 dB step size. The mapping between the reported
L1-SINR value and the measured quantity is described in clause 10.1.16.

#### 9.8D.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-SINR measurements contained in periodic L1-SINR measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.27.

The UE shall transmit the periodic L1-SINR reporting on PUCCH over the
air interface according to the periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in
TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.8D.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting

Reported L1-SINR measurements contained in a Semi-Persistent L1-SINR
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clause 10.1.27. This

PUSCH, if a DCI for triggering report has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-SINR measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command as described in clause 6.1.3.16 in TS
38.321 \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-SINR reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in

aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-SINR reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.27.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-SINR measurement reports, if a DCI
for triggering report has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-SINR reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.8D.4 L1-SINR measurement requirements

#### 9.8D.4.1 L1-SINR reporting with CSI-RS based CMR and no dedicated IMR configured

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements with the
CSI-RS configured as CMR and no dedicated resource configured as IMR for
L1-SINR computation, and the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting L1-SINR measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_Only\_ATG~.

The value of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_Only\_ATG~ is
defined in table 9.8D.4.1-1 for FR1, where

For the value of M,

\- For periodic and semi-persistent CSI-RS resources as CMR, M=1 if
higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* is
configured, and M=3 otherwise;

\- For aperiodic CSI-RS resources as CMR, M=1.

For ATG UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18*,

> P value for a CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as
>
> \- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0
>
> \- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ =
> 0
>
> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max
> is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
> starting at the beginning of any CSI-RS resource occasion:
>
> \- N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within
> the window W, including those overlapped with **measurement gap**
> occasions or SMTC occasions within the window W, and
>
> \- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
> not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window
> W
>
> \- N~available~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
> not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC
> occasion within the window W
>
> \- **T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS
>
> \- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3**.**

Otherwise, for UE with one or multiple omni-directional antenna(s)

For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and when concurrent gaps are
configured,

\- P value for a CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~

> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP\_max
> is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
> starting at the beginning of any CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions
or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS**.**

Otherwise, for a UE not supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or when
concurrent gaps are not configured,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xGP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are \[measurement gaps\] configured for
intra-frequency or inter-frequency, which are overlapping with some but
not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the CSI-RS.

Where:

\- T~CSI-RS~ = the periodicity of CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR
measurement

\- a CSI-RS is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it overlaps a
measurement gap occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement and SMTC means
that CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous conditions.

#### 9.8D.4.2 L1-SINR reporting with SSB based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements with the SSB
configured as CMR and dedicated resource configured as IMR for L1-SINR
computation, in which the NZP-CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource configured as
dedicated IMR shall be 1-to-1 mapped to SSB configured as CMR, with the
same periodicity. The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
L1-SINR measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CMR\_IMR\_ATG~.

The requirements in this clause are not applicable if NZP-CSI-RS or
CSI-IM resource configured as dedicated IMR is scheduled with different
periodicity as SSB configured as CMR.

The value of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CMR\_IMR\_ATG~ is
defined in table 9.8D.4.2-1, where

For the value of M

\- For periodic or semi-persistent NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource as
dedicated IMR, M=1 if the higher layer parameters
*timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* and/or
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured, and M=3
otherwise;

P is defined as the maximum value between P~CMR~ and P~IMR~, i.e., P =
max(P~CMR~, P~IMR~), where

\- the value of P~CMR~ shall be derived in the same way as the value of
P used for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement in clause 9.5D.4.1, in which
the occasions and period of the SSB for CMR shall be used instead.

\- the value of P~IMR~ shall be derived in the same way as the value of
P used for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement in clause 9.5D.4.2, in which
the occasions and period of the NZP CSI-RS for NZP-IMR or CSI-IM for
ZP-IMR shall be used instead.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For L1-SINR measurement with SSB as CMR and CSI-RS or CSI-IM as IMR, the
requirement shall apply if the CSI-RS is configured as IMR with
repetition field as "repetition = OFF" or CSI-IM is configured as IMR.

For L1-SINR measurement with SSB as CMR and CSI-RS/CSI-IM as IMR, no
requirement shall apply if SSB occasions for CMR or CSI-RS/CSI-IM
occasions for IMR are fully overlapped with the configured measurement
gap

#### 9.8D.4.3 L1-SINR reporting with CSI-RS based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

The UE shall be capable of performing L1-SINR measurements with the
CSI-RS resource configured as CMR and dedicated resource configured as
IMR for L1-SINR computation, in which the NZP-CSI-RS or CSI-IM resource
configured as dedicated IMR shall be 1-to-1 mapped to CSI-RS resource
configured as CMR, with the same periodicity. The UE physical layer
shall be capable of reporting L1-SINR measured over the measurement
period of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_IMR\_ATG~.

The requirements in this clause are not applicable if NZP-CSI-RS or
CSI-IM resource configured as dedicated IMR is scheduled with different
periodicity as CSI-RS resource configured as CMR.

The value of T~L1-SINR\_Measurement\_Period\_CSI-RS\_CMR\_IMR\_ATG~ is
defined in table 9.8D.4.3-1, where

For the value of M,

\- M=1 shall be applied if

\- aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS as CMR or dedicated IMR, or

\- aperiodic CSI-IMR as dedicated IMR, or

\- periodic and semi-persistent NZP-CSI-RS as CMR or dedicated IMR and
the higher layer parameters *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
and/or *timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured, or

\- periodic and semi-persistent CSI-IM as dedicated IMR and the higher
layer parameters *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement* and/or
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* are configured;

\- M=3 otherwise.

P is defined as the maximum value between P~CMR~ and P~IMR~, i.e., P =
max(P~CMR~, P~IMR~), where

\- The value of P~CMR~ and P~IMR~ shall be derived in the same way as
the value of P used for CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurement in clause
9.5D.4.2, in which the occasions and period of the CSI-RS for CMR and
NZP CSI-RS for NZP-IMR or CSI-IM for ZP-IMR shall be used instead
respectively.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CSI-RS,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-RS as IMR, the
requirement shall apply only if CSI-RS resources as CMR and IMR are
configured with the same repetition field and the number of CSI-RS
resources in the resource sets for CMR and IMR are same.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-IM as IMR, the
requirement shall apply only if the number of CSI-RS resources in the
resource set for CMR and the number of CSI-IM resources in the resource
set for IMR are same.

For L1-SINR measurement with CSI-RS as CMR and CSI-RS/CSI-IM as IMR, no
requirement shall apply if CSI-RS occasions for CMR or CSI-RS/CSI-IM
occasions for IMR are fully overlapped with the configured measurement
gap.

### 9.8D.5 Measurement restriction for L1-SINR measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring L1-SINR without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB and
CSI-RS/CSI-IM measurements with measurement restrictions as described in
the following clauses.

#### 9.8D.5.1 Measurement restriction if SSB configured for L1-SINR Measurement

For FR1, when the SSB configured as CMR for L1-SINR measurement is in
the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-SINR measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-SINR measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-SINR measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-SINR measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 9.8D.5.2 Measurement restriction if CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement

When the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, UE is
not required to receive CSI-RS for L1-SINR measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement
is within the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS configured for
L1-SINR measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement
without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement
is within the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS configured
for L1-SINR measurement, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS
measurement with restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for L1-SINR
measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based L1-SINR
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR
measurement, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for L1-SINR
measurement without any restriction.

#### 9.8D.5.3 Measurement restriction if CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement

When the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement, UE is
not required to measure CSI-IM for L1-SINR measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-IM configured for L1-SINR
measurement without any restriction.

### 9.8D.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-SINR measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-SINR
measurement are described in the following clauses.

#### 9.8D.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-SINR measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured for L1-SINR measurement with the
same SCS as PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.8D.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-SINR measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-SINR
measurement based on SSB configured for L1-SINR measurement. For UEs
which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the
following restrictions apply due to L1-SINR measurement based on SSB
configured for L1-SINR measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking /CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to be
measured for L1-SINR measurement.

9.9 NR measurements for positioning
-----------------------------------

### 9.9.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for UE capable of performing NR
positioning measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], including RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, NR E-CID, PRS-RSRPP, RSCPD with
RSTD, and RSCP with UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

#### 9.9.1.1 General Aspects of Gap-based Measurement

For gap-based RSTD, RSTD based on aggregated PRS resources from multiple
PFLs, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, UE Rx-Tx time difference based
on aggregated PRS resources and aggregated SRS resources from multiple
PFLs, PRS-RSRPP, DL RSCPD reported with RSTD, DL RSCP reported with UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurements, the requirements in clauses 9.9.2.5,
9.9.2.10, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5, 9.9.4.9, 9.9.6.5, 9.9.7, and 9.9.8 apply
provided:

\- the UE is configured or pre-configured with measurement gaps or
configured with concurrent measurement gaps

\- all positioning frequency layers are measured or associated with only
one per-UE measurement gap, or

\- for the UE supporting *independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, all positioning
frequency layers in the same FR are measured or associated with only one
per-FR measurement gap in the corresponding FR.

\- if the measurement gap is pre-configured, the gap must be activated
throughout the measurement period, and

\- if concurrent measurement gaps are configured, one of the gap
combinations specified in clause 9.1.8.2 is configured, and

\- if the UE does not support *independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, the
configured or pre-configured gap used to perform the PRS measurements
must be of per-UE type, and

\- No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement gaps for PRS
measurement.

All measurement requirements specified in clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.2.10,
9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5, 9.9.4.9, 9.9.6.5, 9.9.7 and 9.9.8 shall apply without
DRX as well as for any DRX configuration specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are fully or partially
overlapped with measurement gaps, and the requirements in clauses
9.9.2.5, 9.9.2.10, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5, 9.9.4.9, 9.9.6.5, 9.9.7, and 9.9.8
are applicable to PRS resources that are fully or partially overlapped
with measurement gaps.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with
measurement gaps if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a
measurement gap occasion. A PRS resource instance is considered to be
overlapped with measurement gap occasion if the minimum number of
unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into account *nr-DL-
PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty* and *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD* is fully
covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time, where the minimum number
is given in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.23, 10.1.23A,
10.1.24, 10.1.25, 10.1.25A, and 10.1.38 for RSTD, RSTD based on
aggregated PRS resources from multiple PFLs, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time
difference and UE Rx-Tx time difference based on aggregated PRS
resources and aggregated SRS resources from multiple PFLs, PRS-RSRPP,
respectively.

When UE is configured with measurement for more than one positioning
requests, the measurement period for each request may be longer than
measurement period when UE is configured with measurement for single
positioning request.

If a positioning measurement gap is configured via *PosGapConfig* and
activated by MAC CE, the measurement requirements in clauses 9.9.2.5,
9.9.2.10, 9.9.3.5, 9.9.4.5, 9.9.4.9, 9.9.6.5, 9.9.7, and 9.9.8 apply
provided that no other MGs are configured, and only one measurement gap
configured via *PosGapConfig* is activated.

When UE supports ***musim-GapPreference-r17*** and if the configured
aperiodic MUSIM gap collides with the measurement gap associated with
PRS measurement, where MUSIM gap collision rule in clause 9.1.10.4 is
applied, longer measurement period for the PRS measurement is expected
than the requirements as defined in clauses 9.9.2.5, 9.9.2.10, 9.9.3.5,
9.9.4.5, 9.9.4.9, 9.9.6.5, 9.9.7, and 9.9.8.

#### 9.9.1.2 General Aspects of Gapless Measurement

The requirements for RSTD, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, and
PRS-RSRPP measurement without measurement gaps specified in clauses
9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6 shall apply provided that:

Positioning frequency layer to be measured is within an active BWP,

UE is configured with PPW, and the PPW for the active BWP containing the
positioning frequency layer to be measured is activated,

No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement period specified
in clauses 9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6, and 9.9.6.6,

PRS is within PPW and does not overlap with other signals/channels of
higher priority,

\- for PPW type 1A/1B, the PPW does not overlap with any symbol for
SSB-based RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB
based RRM measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement
gaps,

\- for PPW type 2, PRS does not overlap with any symbol for SSB-based
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB based RRM
measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement gaps,

max∣ΔT∣≤ THR, where

∆T is the time difference between the start of a slot containing PRS
from the neighbor cell/TRP and the start of the closest slot from the
serving cell;

the range of ∆T is determined by the expected RSTD and expected RSTD
uncertainty in the assistance data;

THR is the threshold as reported in UE capability
*prs-MeasurementWithoutMG-r17*.

SCS of PRS within PPW and SCS of DL active BWP are the same.

All measurement requirements specified in clauses 9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6,
9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6 shall apply without DRX as well as for any DRX
configuration specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

The UE is not required to perform additional SSB measurement for the SSB
configured as QCL source of PRS resources.

The UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are unmuted and
fully or partially overlapped with PPW, and the requirements in clauses
9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6 are applicable to PRS resources
that are unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with PPW.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with PPW
if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a PPW occasion. A PRS
resource instance is considered to be overlapped with PPW occasion if
the minimum number of unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into
account Rx time difference between serving and non-serving cell is fully
covered by the PPW , where the minimum number is given in the accuracy
requirements in clause 10.1.23, 10.1.24, 10.1.25 and 10.1.38 for RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP, respectively.

When UE is configured with measurement for more than one positioning
requests, the measurement period for each request may be longer than
measurement period when UE is configured with measurement for single
positioning request.

When UE supports *MUSIM-GapConfig-17* and the PPW occasion of the target
positioning frequency layer is overlapping with the configured aperiodic
MUSIM gap, longer period for the PRS measurement is expected than the
requirements as defined in clause 9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6 and 9.9.6.6.

#### 9.9.1.3 Scheduling Availability of UE during PRS Measurement without Measurement Gaps

The requirements in this clause apply for UE performing RSTD, PRS-RSRP,
UE Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurement without measurement
gaps.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1A-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
options 1, 2 and 3 is configured with a *type1A* PRS processing window
with priority value '*st1*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS from any serving cell on all symbols
within PRS processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1A-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
option 2 is configured with a *type1A* PRS processing window with
priority value '*st2*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to
receive PDSCH/CSI-RS from any serving cell on all symbols within PRS
processing window but shall receive PDCCH and URLLC PDSCH within PRS
processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1B-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
options 1, 2 and 3 is configured with a *type1B* PRS processing window
with priority value '*st1*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected
to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS from serving cells in the same band as DL
PRS on all symbols within PRS processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType1B-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
option 2 is configured with a *type1B* PRS processing window with
priority value '*st2*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to
receive PDSCH/CSI-RS from a certain band but shall receive PDCCH and
URLLC PDSCH from serving cells in the same band as DL PRS on all symbols
within PRS processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType2-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
options 1, 2 and 3 is configured with a *type2* PRS processing window
with priority value '*st1*' for PRS measurement, then the UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS from the serving cell containing
DL PRS in case of FR1 or from serving cells in the same band as DL PRSi
n case of FR2 on the symbols overlapped with DL PRS within PRS
processing window.

If *prs-ProcessingWindowType2-r17* UE capable of supporting priority
option 2 is configured with a *type2* PRS processing window with
priority value '*st2*' for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to
receive PDSCH/CSI-RS on the symbols overlapped with DL PRS within PRS
processing window but shall receive PDCCH and URLLC PDSCH from the
serving cell containing DL PRS in case of FR1 or from serving cells in
the same band as DL PRSi n case of FR2 on the symbols overlapped with DL
PRS within PRS processing window.

When PRS is lower priority than the DL signals/channels the following
applies when UEs have an activated PRS processing window with *type1A*
or *type1B*:

> \- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except
> SSB of higher priority than PRS in the PPW no later than N~2~ symbols,
> defined in clause 6.4 of TS 38.214 \[26\] for the subcarrier spacing
> $\mu$ of the DL PRS, before the start of the PPW, UE expects to
> receive the DL signals/channels and drop all DL PRS in the PPW.
>
> \- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except
> SSB of higher priority than PRS in the PPW later than N~2~ symbols,
> defined in clause 6.4 of TS 38.214 \[26\] for the subcarrier spacing
> $\mu$ of the DL PRS, before the start of the PPW, UE is not required
> to receive the other DL signals/channels except SSB of higher priority
> and may receive the DL PRS in the PPW.

When PRS is lower priority than the DL signals/channels the following
applies when UEs have an activated PRS processing window with *type2*:

> \- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except
> SSB of higher priority than PRS on a PRS symbol no later than N~2~
> symbols, defined in clause 6.4 of TS 38.214 \[26\] for the subcarrier
> spacing $\mu$ of the DL PRS, before the PRS symbol, UE expects to
> receive the DL signals/channels and drop the PRS symbol.
>
> \- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except
> SSB of higher priority than PRS on a PRS symbol later than N~2~
> symbols, defined in clause 6.4 of TS 38.214 \[26\] for the subcarrier
> spacing $\mu$ of the DL PRS, before the PRS symbol, UE is not required
> to receive the other DL signals/channels except SSB of higher priority
> and may receive the PRS symbol.

For inter-band case for FR2 for the DL signals/channels from a different
FR2 band than the FR2 band of the DL PRS, if the same Rx beam is used
for both FR2 bands and the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority,
UEs are not expected to receive the DL signals/channels if they are
expected to measurement the DL PRS in a configured DL PRS processing
window with *type1B* or *type2*.

### 9.9.2 RSTD measurements

#### 9.9.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.9.2 shall apply provided the UE has
received *NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to measure and report DL RSTD measurements
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

#### 9.9.2.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9.2 apply for periodic and triggered RSTD
measurements, provided:

> \- PRS-RSTD related side conditions given in clause 10.1.23 for FR1
> and FR2 are fulfilled, for a corresponding band.

#### 9.9.2.3 Measurement Capability

UE PRS RSTD measurement capability is as indicated by the UE in
*NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities*, according to TS 37.355\[34\].

#### 9.9.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the
moment when the periodic measurement report is triggered and the moment
when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or
subslot when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with
subframe or slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay
excludes any delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the
measurement report.

The reported RSTD measurement values contained in measurement reports
shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements specified
in clauses 10.1.23.3.

The RSTD measurements performed and reported according to this clause
shall meet the RSTD measurement accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.23,
for each measured DL PRS resource.

longer.

The measurement requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS
symbols are dropped during the measurement period T~RSTD,Total~ within
measurement gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, the
measurement period can be longer.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if the PRS
resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration

given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject

performed by UE by aggregating PRS resources from multiple PFLs as
defined in TS 38.214 \[26\], is defined as:

$$T_{aggregate\_ RSTD} = \sum_{i = 1}^{G}{T_{RSTD\_ aggregate,i}\  + (G - 1)*{T'}_{\text{margin}},}$$

where

> $i$ is the index of effective PFL, corresponding to the group of PFLs

$T_{RSTD\_ aggregate,i}$ is the measurement period for PRS RSTD
measurement in the effective PFL *i* as specified below:

$T_{RSTD\_ aggregate,i} = {\left( {{k_{multiTEG\_ agg,i} \times CSSF}_{PRS\_ agg,i} \times {ceil(\ K}_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}) \times N}_{RxBeam,i} \times \left\lceil \frac{N_{PRS\_ agg\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{agg}}^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS\_ agg,i}}{N_{\text{agg}}} \right\rceil \times N_{sample\_ agg} - 1 \right) \times T}_{effect\_ agg,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last}\text{\_agg},i}$

to measure the same PRS resource as reported in *NR-UE-TEG-Capability*,
and

$k_{TEG,simul,i}$ is the number of Rx TEGs UE can measure simultaneously
which is reported via
*measureSameDL-PRS-ResourceWithDifferentRxTEGsSimul*.

$K_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}$ is a scaling factor for effective PFL $i$ to be
measured within the associated measurement gap pattern, which is defined
as $K_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}$ = **N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured
with concurrent measurement gap, and** $K_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}$ = 1 **for UE
not configured with concurrent measurement gap**.

For a window W of duration max($T_{PRS\_ agg\text{,i}}$~,~ MGRP\_max),
where MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and
per-FR MG within the same FR as the effective PFL, and starting at the
beginning of any associated gap occasions covering the PRS occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions within the window,** including both dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within **the
window, and**

\- N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated gap occasions
covering PRS occasions within the window W, after further accounting for
MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision rule

\- Requirements do not apply if N~available~ = 0.

$N_{PRS\_ agg,i}^{\text{slot}}$ is the maximum number of DL PRS
resources in effective PFL $i$ configured in a slot.

$\text{\ L}_{available\_ PRS\_ agg,i}$ *is the time duration of

$\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$.

\- Note: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS\_agg,i~, only the PRS
resources fully or partially covered by the MG and PRS resources that
satisfy the conditions for PRS BW aggregation are considered.

{N~agg~, T~agg,i~} is UE capability combination per band to aggregate
PRS resources from multiple PFLs within an effective PFL where N~agg~ is
a duration of DL PRS symbols in ms corresponding to
*prs-durationOfTwoPRS-BWA-ProcessingSymbolsN-r18* or
*prs-durationOfThreePRS-BWA-ProcessingSymbolsN-r18* in TS 37.355 \[34\]

TS 37.355 \[34\].

The requirements in this clause for aggregated measurements apply
provided that the linked PRS resource sets on multiple PFLs for
aggregated measurements satisfy all the conditions specified in clause
5.1.6.5.3 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\],
the time$\ T_{RSTD\_ aggregate,Total}$ *s*tarts from the first MG
instance aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data for
aggregation after both the *NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideAssistanceData* message
and *NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation message are delivered from
LMF to the physical layer of UE via LPP \[34\] including a request to
perform measurement by aggregating PRS resources from multiple PFLs via
nr-DL-PRS-JointMeasurementRequestedPFL-List.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the
time$\ T_{RSTD\_ aggregate,Total}$ starts from the first MG instance
aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after the
associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.27\] \[44\], the UE shall perform the aggregated RSTD
measurement in each reporting period and activate the location report at
the time when the periodic timer expires.

When PRS-RSRP is also reported by UE together with RSTD measurement
based on aggregated DL-PRS resources from multiple-PFLs, PRS-RSRP are
performed over the measurement period defined in clause 9.9.2.10.

When PRS-RSRPP is also reported by UE together with RSTD measurement
based on aggregated DL-PRS resources from multiple-PFLs, PRS-RSRPP are
performed over the measurement period defined in clause 9.9.2.10.

If during the measurement period of one or more effective PFLs, the MG
pattern is reconfigured, the measurement period can be longer.

The measurement requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS
symbols are dropped during the measurement period
T~RSTD\_aggregate,Total~ within measurement gaps due to collisions with
other signals; otherwise, the measurement period can be longer.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for aggregated PRS resources,
if the PRS resources to be aggregated are across two sampling duration
of N~agg~ within duration $L_{available\_ PRS\_ agg,i}$.

The measurement requirements do not apply, if time span of the instance
of the PRS resources to be aggregated (including at least the minimum
number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is greater
than UE reported capability N~agg~.

The requirements in clause 9.9.2.10 do not apply if the PRS
configuration given by higher layer parameters
*NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any of the UE measurement
capabilities given by *NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in
*NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities, and it is up to UE implementation which
aggregated PRS resources are measured, subject to* UE measurement
capabilities*.*

If handover occurs while aggregated RSTD measurements are being
performed, then the UE shall continue and complete the on-going
aggregated RSTD measurements. The aggregated RSTD measurement period can
be longer. The UE shall meet the RSTD measurement accuracy requirements
in clause 10.1.23A.2.

### 9.9.3 PRS-RSRP measurements

#### 9.9.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 9.9.3.5 shall apply provided the UE has
received *a* message from LMF via LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to
measure and report PRS-RSRP measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

#### 9.9.3.2 Requirements applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9.3 apply for periodic and triggered
PRS-RSRP measurements, provided:

\- PRS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.24 are met for
a corresponding band.

#### 9.9.3.3 Measurement Capability

UE PRS-RSRP measurement capability is as indicated by the UE in
*NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities* according to TS 37.355 \[34\].

#### 9.9.3.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The reported PRS-RSRP measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clauses 10.1.24.3.

The PRS-RSRP measurement accuracy for all measured PRS resources shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy requriements specified in the
clauses 10.1.24.

#### 9.9.3.5 Measurement Period Requirements

When the physical layer receives *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData*
message and *NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF* via
LPP \[34\], the UE shall be able to measure multiple (up to the UE
capability specified in clause 9.9.3.3) PRS-RSRP measurements, defined
in TS 38.215 \[4\], from configured PRS resources for configured TRPs on
configured positioning frequency layers, within
$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ ms.

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$

where

*i* is the index of positioning frequency layer,

L is total number of positioning frequency layers,

> $T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the PRS-RSRP measurement in
> positioning frequency layer *i*.

$T_{PRS - RSRP,i} = {\left( {\text{CSSF}_{i}*{ceil(\ K}_{p,PRS,i})*N}_{\text{RxBeam},i}*\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS,i}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last}}$

where

> $\text{CSSF}_{i}$ is the carrier specific scaling factor for PRS-RSRP
> measurements specified in clause 9.1.5.2,

$K_{p,PRS,i}$ is a scaling factor for a positioning frequency layer to
be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern, which is
defined as $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = **N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured
with concurrent measurement gap or MUSIM gap or both concurrent
measurement gap and MUSIM gap.** $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = 1 **for UE not
configured with concurrent measurement gap and not configured with MUSIM
gaps**.

For a window W of duration max($T_{PRS,i}$~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and per-FR MG within
the same FR as the positioining frequency layer and periodic MUSIM gaps,
and starting at the beginning of any associated gap occasions covering
the PRS occasion:

**N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions within the window,** including both dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within **the
window, and**

**N~available~ is the number of non-dropped** associated gap occasions
covering **PRS occasions within the window W, after further accounting
for MG and MUSIM gaps collisions by applying the selected gap collision
rule**

Requirements do not apply if **N~available~** =0.

$T_{i}$ corresponds to *durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsInEveryTms* in TS
37.355 \[34\],

$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}} = \ \text{LCM}\left( T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}},\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}} \right)\text{\ is}$
the least common multiple between $T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$ and
$\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}}$ ,

$T_{PRS,i}$ is the maximum PRS resource periodicity among all PRS
resources in positioning frequency layer i,

$\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}}$ is the measurement gap repetition period in
positioning frequency layer *i*.

If positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL PRS resource set
with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among the DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where:

> $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the periodicity of PRS resource sets
> given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-Periodicity*.
>
> $N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource

> *DL-PRS-MutingOption1-r16*.

Note: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
fully or partially covered by the MG are considered.

When PRS-RSRP measurements are configured for DL-AoD, except for
deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time
$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ starts from the first MG instance aligned
with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time$\ T_{PRS - RSRP,total}$
starts from the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in
the assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the PRS-RSRP measurement
in each reporting period and activate the location report at the time
when the periodic timer expires.

NOTE: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with RSTD
measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the* RSTD
measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.2.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the UE
Rx-Tx time difference* measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.4.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

-   if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
    duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

-   if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
    minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy
    requirements) is greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured either per UE request or not per
UE request, the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period $T_{PRS - RSRP,\ total}$ within
measurement gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a
longer measurement period may be used.

The requirements in clause 9.9.3 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If handover occurs while PRS-RSRP measurements are being performed then
the UE shall complete the ongoing PRS-RSRP measurements session. The
PRS-RSRP measurement period can be longer. The UE shall meet the
PRS-RSRP measurement accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.24.

#### 9.9.3.6 Measurement Period Requirements without Measurement Gaps

When the physical layer receives *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData*
message and *NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF* via
LPP \[34\], the UE shall be able to measure multiple (up to the UE
capability specified in clause 9.9.3.3) PRS-RSRP measurements as defined
in TS 38.215 \[4\] without measurement gap, on configured positioning
frequency layer *i*, within $T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ ms.

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$
*if any of the positioning frequency layers are in Case 1, or*

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = max\left( T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \text{T}_{\text{uncertainty,i}} \right)$*,
if all the positioning frequency layers are in Case 2,*

Where,

$i$ is the index of positioning frequency layer, and

$L$ is total number of positioning frequency layers, and

$T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the PRS RSTD measurement in
positioning frequency layer i, and

$\text{T}_{\text{uncertainty,i}}$ is the time from the start of the
first PPW occasion for positioning frequency layer i to the start of

> where

$T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the PRS-RSRP measurement in
positioning frequency layer *i*.

$N_{RxBeam,i}\ $is the scaling factor for Rx beam sweeping, and
$N_{RxBeam,i}$=1 if positioning frequency layer *i* is in FR1. If
positioning frequency layer *i* is in FR2,$\ N_{RxBeam,i}$ is equal to
the value reported by the UE in *supportedLowerRxBeamSweepingFactor-FR2*
if the UE supports the capability for the band containing positioning
frequency layer i, and the LMF indicates *lowerRxBeamSweepingFactor-FR2*
in *NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation*. $N_{RxBeam,i}$ **is** equal
to 8, otherwise.

$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS to be
measured in the positioning frequency layer i to be measured during
$T_{available\_ PRS,i}$, and is calculated in the same way as PRS
duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\]. For
calculation of $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$,

*only unmuted PRS resource instances that meet the applicability
conditions and fully or partially overlapped with PRS processing window
are considered*, if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1, or*

only the PRS resources unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with
the first (PPWL-T2) ms of PPW are considered, if positioning frequency
layer i is in Case 2, where PPWL is the PPW length and T2 corresponds to
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2*.

$N_{PRS,i}^{\text{slot}}$ is the maximum number of DL PRS resources of
positioning frequency layer i configured in a slot,

$\{ N,T\}$ is UE capability combination per band where N is a duration
of DL PRS symbols in ms corresponding to
***ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN*** in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or corresponding to
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN2* in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2*,

$N’$ is UE capability for number of DL PRS resources that it can process
in a slot as indicated by ***ppw-maxNumOfDL-PRS-ResProcessedPerSlot***
in clause 6.4.3 of TS 37.355 \[34\],

$N_{\text{sample}}$ is the number of PRS RSRP measurement samples, where

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 1 if the UE supports
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* \[34\], and the LMF
requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number
of samples, and meets the following conditions:

\- PRS bandwidth is within the active BWP and

\- Magnitude of difference between the serving cell's SS-RSRP and the
neighbor cell's PRS-RSRP is within 6 dB.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 2 if the UE supports
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* \[34\], and the LMF
requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number
of samples, and does not meet the following conditions:

\- PRS bandwidth is within the active BWP and

\- Magnitude of difference between the serving cell's SS-RSRP and the
neighbor cell's PRS-RSRP is within 6 dB.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 4 otherwise.

$\text{T}_{\text{last}}$ is the measurement duration for the last
PRS-RSRP sample, including the sampling time and processing time.

If *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1 and* all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = $T_{\text{i}}$ +PPWL,
else

if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2 and*$\ $all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = PPWL;

otherwise, $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ **=** $T_{\text{i}}$ **+**

$T_{effect,i} = \ \left\lceil \frac{T_{i}}{T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}} \right\rceil*T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$
is the periodicity of PRS-RSRP measurement in positioning frequency
layer *i*,

$T_{i}$ corresponds to ***ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT*** in TS
37.355 \[34\] if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or
corresponds to the sum of *ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2* and

${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among the DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where:

$T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the periodicity of PRS resource sets
given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-Periodicity*.

$N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
muting. If bitmap $\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$ for higher-layer parameter
*DL-*$N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource

given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-MutingBitRepetitionFactor*,
and $L_{\text{muting}}$ is the size of the bitmap
$\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$.

NOTE: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
that meet the applicability conditions and fully or partially covered by
the PRS processing window are considered.

When PRS-RSRP measurements are configured for DL-AoD, the time
$T_{PRS - RSRP,i}$ starts from the first PRS processing window instance
aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

> NOTE: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
> scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with RSTD
measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the* RSTD
measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.2.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the UE
Rx-Tx time difference* measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.4.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration
$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

The requirements in clause 9.9.3 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the PPW is reconfigured or reactivated, the PRS-RSRP
*measurement period can be longer*.

If any *positioning frequency layer is in Case 2, the requirements in
this clause apply provided that the PPWL corresponding to the
positioning frequency layer is larger than (T2+X) ms.*

*The requirements in this clause apply provided that a single
positioning frequency layer is configured for measurement in each PPW.*

#### 9.9.3.7 Void

#### 9.9.3.8 Measurements Period Requirements with both MG and PPW

If the UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the UE shall measure positioning frequency layer
*i* within

\- MG, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with MG, or

\- PPW, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are

The measurement period $T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}}$ is defined as:

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,MG} + \ T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,PPW} + \ T_{\text{guard}}$*,*

Where

*-* $T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,MG}$ is defined in clause 9.9.3.5 and includes
all positioning frequency layers to be measured within MG,

> *-* $T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,PPW}$ is defined in clause 9.9.3.6 and

>
> *-* $T_{\text{guard}}$ is the maximum T~effect~ defined in clauses
> 9.9.3.5 and 9.9.3.6 among all PFLs.

The requirements apply provided the following conditions are satisfied:

\- MGs and PPWs do not overlap in time;

\- Each PFL in the assistance data can be measured completely (all PRS
resources) either within MG or within activated PPW.

### 9.9.4 UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements

#### 9.9.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to measure and report one or more UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

#### 9.9.4.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9.4 apply for periodic and triggered UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurements, provided:

\- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement related side conditions given in
clause 10.1.25 are met for a corresponding band.

\- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement related side conditions given in
clause 10.1.25.x are met for PRS aggregation from multiple PFLs.

UE in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,* according to TS 37.355 \[34\].

#### 9.9.4.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy for all measured DL
PRS resources shall be fulfilled according to the accuracy requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25.

#### 9.9.4.5 Measurement Period Requirements

specified in clause 9.9.4.3) *UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements as
defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\] in configured positioning frequency layers
within the measurement period $T_{UERxTx,Total}$ ms.

$T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,\ Total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$*.*

$$T_{UERxTx,i} = {\left( {{k_{multiTEG,i}*CSSF}_{i}*{ceil(\ K}_{p,PRS,i})*N}_{\text{RxBeam},i}*\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS\text{,i}}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last},i}$$

configured with concurrent measurement gap and not configured with MUSIM
gaps**.

For a window W of duration max($T_{PRS,i}$~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and per-FR MG within
the same FR as the positioning frequency layer and periodic MUSIM gaps,
and starting at the beginning of any associated gap occasions covering
the PRS occasion:

window, and**

**N~available~ is the number of non-dropped** associated gap occasions
covering **PRS occasions within the window W, after further accounting

frequency layer i, and the LMF indicates *lowerRxBeamSweepingFactor-FR2*

equal to 8, otherwise.

$L_{\text{available}\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS
resources in the positioning frequency layer *i*, to be measured during
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$, and is calculated in the same way

NOTE: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
fully or partially covered by the MG are considered.

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\],
the time $T_{UERxTx,Total}$ starts from the first MG instance aligned
with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time$\ T_{UERxTx,Total}$ starts
from the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in the
assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the PRS-RSRP measurement
in each reporting period and activate the location report at the time
when the periodic timer expires.

NOTE: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted if HO
occurs during the measurement period and after SRS reconfiguration on
the target cell is complete.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

\- if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

\- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured either per UE request or not per
UE request, the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period T~UERxTx,Total~ within measurement
gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a longer
measurement period may be used.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

When PRS-RSRPP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRPP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

The requirements in clause 9.9.4 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured,
subject to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

When PSCell or SCell addition or release does not cause SRS
reconfiguration during the measurement period, UE continues the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement, and the measurement period requirements
apply.

When PSCell or SCell addition or release causes SRS reconfiguration
during the measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement after the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell
is complete.

When SRS is reconfigured without serving cell change during the
measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement after the SRS reconfiguration is complete.If UE uplink
transmission timing changes due to the network-configured Timing Advance
command during the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period, then the
UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted after uplink
transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period requirements in this clause shall not apply.

When a serving cell change occurs during the measurement period, the UE
shall continue and complete the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
provided that the serving cell change does not impact SRS configuration
for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 during the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period is restarted after uplink transmission timing
changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period
requirements in this clause shall not apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1.2 during the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period, then:

> \- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period requirements in this
> clause shall apply for a cell, which is also the downlink reference
> cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

\- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period requirements in this
clause shall not apply for a cell, which is not the downlink reference
cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission. The UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement period may be restarted in such case.

When physical layer receives last of
*NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF via LPP

*if any of the positioning frequency layers are in Case 1, or*

$T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap\text{,\ Total}} = max\left( T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap\text{,i}} + \text{T}_{\text{uncertainty,i}} \right)$*,
if all the positioning frequency layers are in Case 2.*

Where,

positioning frequency layer i, and

$\text{T}_{\text{uncertainty,i}}$ is the time from the start of the
first PPW occasion for positioning frequency layer i to the start of
measurement period $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap\text{,\ Total}}$.

A positioning frequency layer is in Case 1 if UE reports
*ppw-durationOfPRS-Processing1-r17* for the band containing the
positioning frequency layer, and a positioning frequency layer is in
Case 2 if UE reports *ppw-durationOfPRS-Processing2-r17* for the band
containing the positioning frequency layer.

$T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap\text{,i}}$ is the measurement period for UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement in positioning frequency layer *i* as
specified below.

including the sampling time and processing time.

If *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1 and* all of the PRS

The time $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ starts from the first PRS processing
window instance aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data
after both the *NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted if HO
occurs during the measurement period and after SRS reconfiguration on
the target cell is complete.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

\- if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

\- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the PRS processing window is reconfigured or reactivated either
per UE request or not per UE request, the measurement period can be
longer.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ within
PRS processing window due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a
longer measurement period may be used.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

When PRS-RSRPP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRPP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

The requirements in clause 9.9.4.6 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured,
subject to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

When PSCell or SCell addition or release does not cause SRS
reconfiguration during the measurement period, UE continues the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement, and the measurement period requirements
apply.

When PSCell or SCell addition or release causes SRS reconfiguration
during the measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement after the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell
is complete.

*W*hen SRS is reconfigured without cell change during the measurement
period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement after
the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell is complete.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the network-configured
Timing Advance command during the UE Rx-Tx measurement period, then the
UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted after uplink
transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period requirements in this clause shall not apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is
restarted after uplink transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1.2 during the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period, then:

> \- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period requirements in this
> clause shall apply for a cell, which is also the downlink reference
> cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

\- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period requirements in this
clause shall not apply for a cell, which is not the downlink reference
cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission. The UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement period may be restarted in such case.

If any *positioning frequency layer is in Case 2, the requirements in
this clause apply provided that the PPWL corresponding to the
positioning frequency layer is larger than (T2+X) ms.*

*The requirements in this clause apply provided that a single
positioning frequency layer is configured for measurement in each PPW.*

#### 9.9.4.7 Void

#### 9.9.4.8 Measurements Period Requirements with both MG and PPW

If the UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the UE shall measure positioning frequency layer
*i* within

\- MG, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with MG, or

\- PPW, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with PPW.

The measurement period $T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,\ Total}}$ is defined as:

$T_{\text{UERxTx}\text{,\ Total}} = T_{UERxTx,Total,MG} + \ T_{UERxTx,Total,PPW}\  + \ T_{\text{guard}}$*,*

Where

*-* $T_{UERxTx,Total,MG}$ is defined in clause 9.9.4.5 and includes all
positioning frequency layers to be measured within MG,

*-* $T_{UERxTx,Total,PPW}$ is defined in clause 9.9.4.6 and includes all
positioning frequency layers to be measured within PPW,

*-* $T_{\text{guard}}$ is the maximum T~effect~ defined in clauses
9.9.4.5 and 9.9.4.6 among all PFLs.

The requirements apply provided the following conditions are satisfied:

\- MGs and PPWs do not overlap in time;

\- Each PFL in the assistance data can be measured completely (all PRS
resources) either within MG or within activated PPW.

#### 9.9.4.9 Measurements Period Requirements with Bandwidth Aggregation

When UE physical layer receives last of
*NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF via LPP \[34\]
with a request to perform measurement by aggregating PRS resources from
multiple PFLs via nr-DL-PRS-JointMeasurementRequestedPFL-List, the UE
shall be able to perform UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement by
aggregating PRS resources from multiple PFLs (*up to the UE capability
specified in clause 9.9.2.3*) defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\], during the
measurement period T~UE\_RxTx\_aggregated,\ Total~ defined as:

T~UE\_RxTx\_aggregated,\ Total~ = T~non-aggregate\_RxTx~ +
T~aggregated\_RxTx~ + T~margin~,

where,

T~non\_aggregate\_RxTx~ is the total measurement period for UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement on PFLs that do not contain PRS resources
for aggregation.

Calculation of T~non\_aggregate~ is based on clause 9.9.4.5 with the
following exceptions,

\- only PFLs containing resource set(s) not linked to any other resource
set(s) are considered in $L$

\- on each PFL $i$, only resource set(s) not linked to any other
resource set(s) are considered in
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$,
$N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}$ and $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 2 if the UE supports the capability of
positioning measurements with reduced number of samples as indicated by
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* specified in TS 37.355
\[34\], and the LMF requests the UE to perform positioning measurements
with reduced number of samples,

\- $\left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)$ ***is replaced
by*** $\left( L - 1 \right)*{T'}_{\text{margin}}$.

T~non\_aggregate\_RxTx~ is equal to zero if UE is not configured to
perform non-aggregated measurements by the LMF.

T~aggregate\_RxTx~ is the total measurement period for UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements performed by UE by aggregating PRS resources
from multiple PFLs as defined in TS 38.214 \[26\].

If UE is configured to perform measurements on PFLs that contain PRS
resources for aggregation and on PFLs that do not contain PRS resources
for aggregation, T~margin~ =${T'}_{\text{margin}}$ is delay margin to
account for delay between Rx-Tx time difference measurement performed by
UE on PFLs that contain PRS resources for aggregation and Rx-Tx time
difference measurement performed by UE on PFLs that do not contain PRS
resources for aggregation.

If UE is only configured to perform measurements on PFLs that contain
PRS resources for aggregation or if UE is only configured to perform
measurements on PFLs that do not contain PRS resources for aggregation,
then T~margin~ = 0.

${T'}_{\text{margin}} = \ max(Teffect,i)$, by considering both
aggregated PFLs and non-aggregated PFLs configured for positioning
measurement.

If UE is capable of performing latency reduced positioning measurements
and is configured to perform latency reduced positioning measurement by
LMF via *reducedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-r17* \[34\], then N~sample~ = 2
shall be considered in calculations of T~aggregate\_RxTx~ and
T~non-aggregate\_RxTx~.

If UE is not capable to perform latency reduced positioning measurements
or is not configured to perform latency reduced positioning measurement
by LMF via *reducedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-r17* \[34\], then N~sample~
= 4 shall be considered in calculations of T~aggregate\_RxTx~ and
T~non-aggregate\_RxTx~.

T~aggregate\_RxTx~, total measurement period for UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements performed by UE by aggregating PRS resources
from multiple PFLs as defined in TS 38.214 \[26\], is defined as:

$$T_{aggregate\_ RxTx} = \sum_{i = 1}^{G}{T_{RxTx\_ aggregate,i}\  + (G - 1)*{T'}_{\text{margin}},}$$

where

> $i$ is the index of effective PFL, corresponding to the group of PFLs
> containing linked PRS resource sets to be aggregated for UE Rx-Tx time
> difference measurement,
>
> G denotes the number of effective PFLs that UE is configured to
> perform aggregated measurements on. G is configured by LMF and is
> provisioned to UE via *nr-DL-PRS-AggregationInfo.*

$T_{RxTx\_ aggregate,i}$ is the measurement period for UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement in the effective positioning frequency layer *i*
as specified below:

$T_{RxTx\_ aggregate,i} = {\left( {{k_{multiTEG\_ agg,i} \times CSSF}_{PRS\_ agg,i} \times {ceil(\ K}_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}) \times N}_{RxBeam\_ agg,i} \times \left\lceil \frac{N_{PRS\_ agg\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{agg}}^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS\_ agg,i}}{N_{\text{agg}}} \right\rceil \times N_{sample\_ agg} - 1 \right) \times T}_{effect\_ agg,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last}\text{\_agg},i}$

Otherwise,

DL PRS resource simultaneously from multiple Rx TEGs, and

$k_{multiTEG,i}$*=*$\left\lceil \frac{N_{TEG,i}}{k_{TEG,simul,i}} \right\rceil$
if UE is capable of receiving the same DL PRS resource simultaneously
from multiple Rx TEGs.

$N_{TEG,i}$ is the number of Rx TEGs with which UE is requested to
measure aggregated PRS resource indicated via
*measureSameDL-PRS-ResourceWithDifferentRxTEGs-r17* or

indicated, $N_{TEG,i}$ is the maximum number of Rx TEGs with which UE
can support to measure the same PRS resource as reported in
*NR-UE-TEG-Capability*, and

$k_{TEG,simul,i}$ is the number of Rx TEGs UE can measure simultaneously
which is reported via
*measureSameDL-PRS-ResourceWithDifferentRxTEGsSimul*.

$K_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}$ is a scaling factor for effective positioning
frequency layer $i$ to be measured within the associated measurement gap
pattern, which is defined as $K_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}$ = **N~total~ /
N~available~ for UE configured with concurrent measurement gap, and**
$K_{p,PRS\_ agg,i}$ = 1 **for UE not configured with concurrent
measurement gap**.

For a window W of duration max($T_{PRS\_ agg\text{,i}}$~,~ MGRP\_max),
where MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and
per-FR MG within the same FR as the effective positioning frequency
layer, and starting at the beginning of any associated gap occasions
covering the PRS occasion:

**- N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions within the window,** including both dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within **the
window, and**

\- N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated gap occasions

MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision rule

\- Requirements do not apply if N~available~ = 0.

resources in effective positioning frequency layer $i$ configured in a
slot.

$\text{\ L}_{available\_ PRS\_ agg,i}$ *is the time duration of
available PRS in the effective positioning frequency layer* $i$ *to be
measured during* $T_{available\_ PRS\_ agg,i}$*, and is calculated in
the same way as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214

The requirements in this clause for aggregated measurements apply
provided that the linked PRS resource sets on multiple PFLs for
aggregated measurements satisfy all the conditions specified in clause
5.1.6.5.3 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273
\[44\], the time$\ T_{UE\_ RxTx\_ aggregated,Total}$ *s*tarts from the
first MG instance aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data
for aggregation after both the *NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation
message and NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message are delivered
from LMF to the physical layer of UE via LPP \[34\] including a request
to perform measurement by aggregating PRS resources from multiple PFLs

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined

time$\ T_{UE\_ RxTx\_ aggregated,Total}$ starts from the first MG
instance aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after the
associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the aggregated UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement in each reporting period and activate the
location report at the time when the periodic timer expires.

When PRS-RSRP is also reported by UE together with UE RX-Tx time
difference measurement based on aggregated DL-PRS resources from
multiple-PFLs, PRS-RSRP are performed over the measurement period
defined in 9.9.4.9.

When PRS-RSRPP is also reported by UE together with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement based on aggregated DL-PRS resources from
multiple-PFLs, PRS-RSRPP are performed over the measurement period
defined in 9.9.4.9.

If during the measurement period of one or more effective positioning
frequency layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured, the measurement period
can be longer.

The measurement requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS
symbols are dropped during the measurement period
T~UE\_RxTx\_aggregated,Total~ within measurement gaps due to collisions
with other signals; otherwise, the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in clause 9.9.4.9 do not apply if the PRS configuration

of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which aggregated PRS resources are

When PSCell or SCell addition or release does not cause SRS
reconfiguration during the measurement period, UE continues the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement, and the measurement period requirements
apply.

When PSCell or SCell addition or release causes SRS reconfiguration
during the measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement after the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell
is complete.

When SRS is reconfigured without serving cell change during the
measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement after the SRS reconfiguration is complete. If UE uplink
transmission timing changes due to the network-configured Timing Advance
command during the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period, then the
UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted after uplink
transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period requirements in this clause shall not apply.

When a serving cell change occurs during the measurement period, the UE
shall continue and complete the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
provided that the serving cell change does not impact SRS configuration
for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 during the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period is restarted after uplink transmission timing
changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period
requirements in this clause shall not apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1.2 during the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period, then:

> \- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period requirements in this
> clause shall apply for a cell, which is also the downlink reference
> cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

\- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period requirements in this
clause shall not apply for a cell, which is not the downlink reference
cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission. The UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement period may be restarted in such case.

The UE shall meet the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy
requirements in clause 10.1.25A.2.

UE in *NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities*, according to TS 37.355\[34\].

#### 9.9.7.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the
moment when the periodic measurement report is triggered and the moment
when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the

able to measure multiple (*up to the UE capability specified in clause
9.9.7.3*) DL RSTD and RSCPD measurements, defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\],
during the time window only.

When LMF does not configure measurement time window(s):

\- When a single PFL, requirements in clause 9.9.2.5 apply to both RSCPD
and RSTD measurements.

\- When multiple PFLs are configured for legacy measurements, the UE
performs RSCPD measurement on a single PFL that is common between the
reference TRP and the target TRP. The requirement in clause 9.9.2.5

performing both RSTD and RSCPD measurement inside the indicated time
window subject to *supportOfMeasurementsInTimeWindow*:

\- The requirements in Clause 9.9.7.5 apply to DL RSTD measurement and
DL RSCPD measurement.

If a one-shot time window is configured*, the UE shall be able to
measure multiple (*up to the UE capability specified in clause 9.9.7.3*)
DL RSTD and DL RSCPD measurements, defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\], *based
on the indicated PRS resource sets occurring inside the* one-shot *time
window* during the measurement period $T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,Total}$
defined as:

$T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,Total} = min(L_{\text{window}},\text{MGL}) + T_{i}$
*,*

and the UE shall be able to measure multiple DL RSTD measurements,
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], during the measurement period
$T_{RSTD,Total,with\ one\ shot\ window}$ defined as:

$T_{RSTD,Total,\ with\ one\ shot\ window} = T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,Total} + max\left( T_{effect,i} \right) + T_{RSTD,Total}$
,

where:

> \- the start of the measurement is the start of the one-shot time
> window, and
>
> \- $L_{\text{window}}$ is the length of the one-shot window, and
>
> \- $T_{effect,i}$ ***and*** $T_{i}$ ***are*** defined in the following
> of this clause, and
>
> \- $T_{\text{RSTD},\text{Total}}$ is defined in clause 9.9.2.5, and
>
> \- $\text{MGL}$ is the measurement gap length.

The requirements with one-shot window assume scaling factors equal 1 for
the PFLs, for which the one-shot time window is configured.

If a periodic time window is configured*, the UE shall be able to
measure multiple (*up to the UE capability specified in clause 9.9.7.3*)
RSTD and DL RSCPD measurements, defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\], during the
measurement period $T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,Total}$ defined as:

$T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,Total} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,i} + \ \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)\ }$

where:

\- $i$ is the index of positioning frequency layer,

\- $L$ is total number of positioning frequency layers, and

\- $T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the PRS RSTD measurement in
positioning frequency layer i

$T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,i}$ is the measurement period for PRS RSTD with
RSCPD measurement in positioning frequency layer *i* as specified below:

$T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,i} = {\left( {{k_{multiTEG,i} \times CSSF}_{PRS,i} \times {ceil(\ K}_{p,PRS,i}) \times N}_{RxBeam,i} \times \left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS,i}}{N} \right\rceil \times N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right) \times T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last}\text{,i}}$
,

where:

DL-RSCPD measurement performed during $T_{RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,i}$ is a
single sample measurement. The DL-RSCPD measurement of reference TRP and
the target TRP is performed on the same PFL.

$N_{RxBeam,i}$, $\text{CSSF}_{PRS,i}$, $k_{multiTEG,i}$,
$N_{\text{PRS},i}^{\text{slot}}$, $N$, $N’$, $T_{effect,i}$***,*** and
$\text{T}_{\text{last}\text{,i}}$ are defined in clause 9.9.2.5.

$N_{\text{sample}}$ = 1 or 2 or 4 as defined in clause 9.9.2.5.

$\text{\ L}_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}$ is the time duration of
available PRS in the positioning frequency layer to be measured during
$T_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}$, and is calculated in the same way
as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\].

> When periodic time window(s) are configured by the LMF and PFL *i* is
> associated with the configured time window,
> $T_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i} = \text{LCM}(T_{prs,i},\ \text{MGRP},\ T_{\text{window}})$,
> the least common multiple between $T_{prs,i}$ , $\text{MGRP\ }$and
> $T_{\text{window}}$, $T_{\text{window}}$ being the maximum periodicity
> of the indicated time window(s).
>
> When the periodic time window(s) are configured by the LMF and the PFL
> *i* is not associated with the configured time window,
> $T_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i} = \text{LCM}(T_{prs,i},\ \text{MGRP})$.

$T_{prs,i}$ and $\text{MGRP}$ are defined in clause 9.9.2.5.

$L_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}$ *and* $T_{prs,i}$ *are calculated
by* only considering the PRS resources in the indicated resources sets
overlapping with both the MG and the indicated time window(s).

$K_{p,PRS,i}$ is a scaling factor for a positioning frequency layer to
be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern, which is
defined as $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = **N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured
with concurrent measurement gap, and** $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = 1 **for UE not
configured with concurrent measurement gap**.

When periodic time window(s) are configured by the LMF, for a window W
of duration max($T_{PRS,i}$~,~ MGRP\_max, $T_{\text{window}}$), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and per-FR
MG within the same FR as the positioning frequency layer, and starting
at the beginning of any associated gap occasions covering the PRS
occasion and the periodic time window:

**N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions and the periodic time window(s) within the window W,**
including both dropped and non-dropped instances of the associated
measurement gap within **the window W, and**

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated gap occasions
covering PRS occasions and the periodic time window(s) within the window
W, after further accounting for MG collisions by applying the selected
gap collision rule.

Requirements do not apply if **N~available~** =0.

Otherwise, for a window W of duration max($T_{PRS,i}$~,~ MGRP\_max),
where MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and
per-FR MG within the same FR as the positioning frequency layer, and
starting at the beginning of any associated gap occasions covering the
PRS occasion:

**N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions within the window W,** including both dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within **the
window, and**

> **N~available~ is the number of non-dropped** associated gap occasions
> covering **PRS occasions within the window W, after further accounting
> for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision rule**
>
> Requirements do not apply if **N~available~** =0.

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\],
the time T~RSCPD\ with\ RSTD~ *s*tarts from the first time window
(T~RSCPD~) configured by LMF within MG instance aligned with a DL PRS
resource(s) in the assistance data after both the
*NR-TDOA-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation message are delivered from LMF to
the physical layer of UE via LPP \[34\].*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time T~RSCPD\ with\ RSTD~
starts from the first time window (T~RSCPD~) configured by LMF within MG
instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in the assistance data after
the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the RSCPD with RSTD
measurement in each reporting period within the time window(T~RSCPD~)
configured by LMF within MG instance and activate the location report at
the time when the periodic timer expires.

If during the measurement period, the MG pattern is reconfigured or time
window (T~RSCPD~) for RSCPD measurement is reconfigured, the measurement
period can be longer.

When PRS-RSRP is also configured to UE, RSCPD with RSTD and RSRP are
performed over the same measurement period.

When PRS-RSRPP is also configured to UE, RSCPD with RSTD and RSRPP are
performed over the same measurement period.

The measurement requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS
symbols are dropped during the measurement period T~RSCPD\ with\ RSTD,i~
within measurement gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise,
the measurement period can be longer.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if the PRS
resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration
$L_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}$.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if time
span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the minimum number
of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is greater than
UE reported capability N.

The requirements in clause 9.9.7 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If handover occurs while RSTD and RSCPD measurements are being performed
together by UE, then the UE shall continue and complete the on-going
RSTD and RSCPD measurements. The measurement period for RSCPD with RSTD
measurement can be longer. The UE shall meet the RSTD measurement
accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.23. The UE shall also meet the
RSCPD measurement accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.43.2.

the measurement period $T_{RSCP\ with\ UERxTx,Total}$ defined as:

$T_{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx,Total} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx,i} + \ \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)\ }$*,*

where:

\- $i$ is the index of positioning frequency layer,

\- $L$ is total number of positioning frequency layers, and

\- $T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement in positioning frequency layer *i*.

$T_{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx,i}$ is the measurement period for DL RSCP
with UE Rx-Tx measurement in positioning frequency layer *i* as
specified below:

$T_{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx,i} = {\left( {{k_{multiTEG,i}*\text{CSSF}}_{PRS,i}*{ceil(\ K}_{p,PRS,i})*N}_{RxBeam,i}*\left\lceil \frac{N_{PRS,i}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last}\text{,i}}$
,

where:

-   DL RSCP performed during $T_{\text{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx}}$ is a
    single sample measurement where DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx measurements
    are performed on the same PFL.

-   $N_{RxBeam,i}$, $\text{CSSF}_{PRS,i}$, $k_{multiTEG,i}$,
    > $N_{\text{sample}},\ N_{\text{PRS},i}^{\text{slot}}$, $N$, $N’$,
    > $T_{effect,i}$***,*** and $\text{T}_{\text{last}\text{,i}}$ are
    > defined in clause 9.9.4.5.

-   $N_{\text{sample}}$ = 1 or 2 or 4 as defined in clause 9.9.4.

-   $K_{p,PRS,i}$ is a scaling factor for a positioning frequency layer
    > to be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern,
    > which is defined as $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = **N~total~ / N~available~ for
    > UE configured with concurrent measurement gap, and** $K_{p,PRS,i}$
    > = 1 **for UE not configured with concurrent measurement gap**.

When periodic time window(s) are configured by the LMF, for a window W
of duration max($T_{PRS,i}$~,~ MGRP\_max, $T_{\text{window}}$), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and per-FR
MG within the same FR as the positioning frequency layer, and starting
at the beginning of any associated gap occasions covering the PRS
occasion and the periodic time window:

**N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions and the periodic time window(s) within the window W,**
including both dropped and non-dropped instances of the associated
measurement gap within **the window W, and**

N~available~ is the number of non-dropped associated gap occasions
covering PRS occasions and the periodic time window(s) within the window
W, after further accounting for MG collisions by applying the selected
gap collision rule.

Requirements do not apply if **N~available~** =0.

Otherwise, for a window W of duration max($T_{PRS,i}$~,~ MGRP\_max),
where MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and
per-FR MG within the same FR as the positioning frequency layer, and
starting at the beginning of any associated gap occasions covering the
PRS occasion:

**N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions within the window W,** including both dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within **the
window W, and**

**N~available~ is the number of non-dropped** associated gap occasions
covering **PRS occasions within the window W, after further accounting
for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision rule**

Requirements do not apply if **N~available~** =0.

\- $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS
resources in the positioning frequency layer, to be measured during
$T_{available\_ PRS,i}$, and is calculated in the same way as PRS
duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\].

\- When periodic time window(s) are configured by the LMF and PFL *i* is
associated with the configured time window,
$T_{available\_ PRS,i} = \text{LCM}(T_{prs,i},\ \text{MGRP},\ T_{\text{window}})$,
the least common multiple between $T_{prs,i}$ , MGRP$\ $, and
$T_{\text{window}}$, $T_{\text{window}}$ being the maximum periodicity
of the indicated time window(s).

\- When periodic time window(s) are configured by the LMF and the PFL
*i* is not associated with the configured time window,
$T_{available\_ PRS,i} = \text{LCM}(T_{prs,i},\ \text{MGRP})$.

\- $T_{prs,i}$ and MGRP are defined in clause 9.9.8.5.

\- $L_{\text{available}\_ PRS,i}$ and $T_{prs,i}$ are calculated by only
considering the PRS resources in the indicated resources sets
overlapping with both the MG and the indicated time window(s).

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\],
the time $T_{\text{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx}}$ starts from the first time
window (T~DL\ RSCP~) configured by LMF within MG instance aligned with
DL PRS resource(s) in the assistance data after both the
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the
time$\ T_{\text{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx}}$ starts from the first time
window (T~DL\ RSCP~) configured by LMF within MG instance aligned with
DL PRS resource(s) in the assistance data after the associated event(s)
occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the DL RSCP with UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurement in each reporting period and activate
the location report at the time when the periodic timer expires.

The DL RSCP with UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is
restarted if HO occurs during the measurement period and after SRS
reconfiguration on the target cell is complete.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

\- if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
duration $L_{available\_ PRS}$ or

\- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of the positioning frequency layer, the
MG pattern is reconfigured either per UE request or not per UE request,
the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period
$T_{\text{DL\ RSCP\ with\ UERxTx}}$ within measurement gaps due to
collisions with other signals; otherwise, a longer measurement period
may be used.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for multi-RTT,with a request to perform RSCP
with UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

When PRS-RSRPP is configured for multi-RTT with a request to perform
RSCP with UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement, RSCP with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements and PRS-RSRPP measurements are performed over
the same measurement period.

The requirements in clause 9.9.8 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer parameters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured,
subject to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

When PSCell or SCell addition or release does not cause SRS
reconfiguration during the measurement period, UE shall continue and
complete the DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements, and the
measurement period requirements apply.

When PSCell or SCell addition or release causes SRS reconfiguration
during the measurement period, UE shall restart the DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement after the SRS reconfiguration on the target
cell is complete.

When SRS is reconfigured without serving cell change during the
measurement period, UE shall restart the DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement after the SRS reconfiguration is complete.

When a serving cell change occurs during the measurement period, the UE
shall restart DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the network-configured
Timing Advance command during the measurement period, then the DL RSCP
with UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is restarted after
uplink transmission timing changes, and the DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 during the measurement period,
then the DL RSCP with UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is
restarted after uplink transmission timing changes, and the DL RSCP and
UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period requirements in this clause
shall not apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1.2 during the measurement period, then:

\- DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx measurement period requirements in this clause
shall apply for a cell, which is also the downlink reference cell
(defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

\- DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx measurement period requirements in this clause
shall not apply for a cell, which is not the downlink reference cell
(defined in clause 7.1.1) for SRS transmission. The DL RSCP with UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurement period may be restarted in such case.

positioning measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], including RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, and PRS-RSRPP measurements.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

This clause applies to both RedCap positioning with and without FH.

#### 9.9A.1.1 General Aspects of Gap-based Measurement

For gap-based RSTD, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, and PRS-RSRPP
measurements, the requirements in clauses 9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4 and
9.9A.5 apply provided:

\- the RedCap UE is configured or pre-configured with measurement gaps
or configured with concurrent measurement gaps

\- all positioning frequency layers are measured or associated with only
one per-UE measurement gap, or

\- for the RedCap UE supporting *independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, all
positioning frequency layers in the same FR are measured or associated
with only one per-FR measurement gap in the corresponding FR.

\- if the measurement gap is pre-configured, the gap must be activated
throughout the measurement period, and

\- if concurrent measurement gaps are configured, one of the gap
combinations specified in clause 9.1.8.2 is configured, and

\- if the RedCap UE does not support *independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, the
configured or pre-configured gap used to perform the PRS measurements
must be of per-UE type, and

\- No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement gaps for PRS
measurement, and

All measurement requirements specified in clauses 9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4
and 9.9A.5 shall apply without DRX as well as for any DRX configuration
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

RedCap UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are fully or
partially overlapped with measurement gaps, and the requirements in
clauses 9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4 and 9.9A.5 are applicable to PRS
resources that are fully or partially overlapped with measurement gaps.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with
measurement gaps if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a
measurement gap occasion. A PRS resource instance is considered to be
overlapped with measurement gap occasion if the minimum number of
unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into account *nr-DL-
PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty* and *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD* is fully
covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time, where

\- the minimum number is given in the accuracy requirements without FH
for 2Rx RedCap UEs in clause 10.1.23.2 for RSTD measurement, 10.1.24.2
for PRS-RSRP measurement, 10.1.25.2 for UE Rx-Tx *time difference*
measurement, and 10.1.38.2 for PRS-RSRPP measurement,

2Rx RedCap UEs in clause 10.1A.16.2.2 for RSTD measurement, 10.1A.17.2
for PRS-RSRP measurement, 10.1A.18.2.3 for UE Rx-Tx *time difference*
measurement, and 10.1A.19.2 for PRS-RSRPP measurement,and

\- the minimum number is given in the accuracy requirements with FH for
1Rx RedCap UEs in clause 10.1A.16.2.2 for RSTD measurement, 10.1A.17.2
for PRS-RSRP measurement, 10.1A.18.2.4 for UE Rx-Tx *time difference*
measurement, and 10.1A.19.2 for PRS-RSRPP measurement.

When RedCap UE is configured with measurement for more than one
positioning requests, the measurement period for each request may be
longer than measurement period when RedCap UE is configured with
measurement for single positioning request.

If a positioning measurement gap is configured via *PosGapConfig* and
activated by MAC CE, the measurement requirements in clauses 9.9A.2,
9.9A.3, 9.9A.4 and 9.9A.5 apply provided that no other MGs are
configured, and only one measurement gap configured via *PosGapConfig*
is activated.

#### 9.9A.1.2 General Aspects of Gapless Measurement for RedCap positioning without FH

The requirements for RSTD, PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference, and
PRS-RSRPP measurement without measurement gaps specified in clauses
9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4 and 9.9A.5 shall apply provided that:

\- Positioning frequency layer to be measured is within an active BWP,

\- UE is configured with PPW, and the PPW for the active BWP containing
the positioning frequency layer to be measured is activated,

\- No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement period
specified in clauses 9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4 and 9.9A.5,

\- PRS is within PPW and does not overlap with other signals/channels of
higher priority,

\- for PPW type 1A/1B, the PPW does not overlap with any symbol for
SSB-based RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB
based RRM measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement
gaps,

\- for PPW type 2, PRS does not overlap with any symbol for SSB-based
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB based RRM
measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement gaps,

\- max∣ΔT∣≤ THR, where

\- ∆T is the time difference between the start of a slot containing PRS
from the neighbor cell/TRP and the start of the closest slot from the
serving cell;

\- the range of ∆T is determined by the expected RSTD and expected RSTD
uncertainty in the assistance data;

\- THR is the threshold as reported in UE capability
*prs-MeasurementWithoutMG-r17*.

\- SCS of PRS within PPW and SCS of DL active BWP are the same.

All measurement requirements specified in clauses 9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4
and 9.9A.5 shall apply without DRX as well as for any DRX configuration
specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

The UE is not required to perform additional SSB measurement for the SSB
configured as QCL source of PRS resources.

The UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are unmuted and
fully or partially overlapped with PPW, and the requirements in clauses
9.9A.2, 9.9A.3, 9.9A.4 and 9.9A.5 are applicable to PRS resources that
are unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with PPW.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with PPW
if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a PPW occasion. A PRS
resource instance is considered to be overlapped with PPW occasion if
the minimum number of unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into
account Rx time difference between serving and non-serving cell is fully
covered by the PPW , where

\- the minimum number is given in the accuracy requirements without FH
for 2Rx RedCap UEs in clauses 10.1.23.2 for RSTD measurement, 10.1.24.2
for PRS-RSRP measurement, 10.1.25.2 for UE Rx-Tx *time difference*
measurement, and 10.1.38.2 for PRS-RSRPP measurement, and

difference* measurement, and 10.1A.19.2 for PRS-RSRPP measurement.

When UE is configured with measurement for more than one positioning
requests, the measurement period for each request may be longer than
measurement period when UE is configured with measurement for single
positioning request.

#### 9.9A.1.3 Scheduling Availability of UE during PRS Measurement without Measurement Gaps for RedCap positioning without FH

The requirements in this clause apply for RedCap UE performing RSTD,
PRS-RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time difference and PRS-RSRPP measurement without
measurement gaps.

If Cap. 1A UE capable of supporting priority options 1, 2 and 3 is
configured with priority state 1 for PRS measurement, then UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS on all symbols within PRS
processing window.

If Cap.1A UE capable of supporting priority option 2 is configured with
priority state 2 for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to receive
PDSCH/CSI-RS on all symbols within PRS processing window but shall
receive PDCCH and URLLC PDSCH within PRS processing window.

If Cap. 1B UE capable of supporting priority options 1, 2 and 3 is
configured with priority state 1 for PRS measurement, then UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS from a certain \[band or CC\] on
all symbols within PRS processing window.

If Cap. 1B UE capable of supporting priority option 2 is configured with
priority state 2 for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to receive
PDSCH/CSI-RS from a certain \[band or CC\] but shall receive PDCCH and
URLLC PDSCH from a certain \[band or CC\] on all symbols within PRS
processing window.

If Cap. 2 UE capable of supporting priority options 1, 2 and 3 is
configured with priority state 1 for PRS measurement, then the UE is not
expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS on the symbols overlapped with DL
PRS within PRS processing window.

If Cap. 2 UE capable of supporting priority option 2 is configured with
priority state 2 for PRS measurement, then UE is not expected to receive
PDSCH/CSI-RS on the symbols overlapped with DL PRS within PRS processing
window but shall receive PDCCH and URLLC PDSCH on the symbols overlapped
with DL PRS within PRS processing window.

When PRS is lower priority than the DL signals/channels the following
applies for cap1A and 1B UEs:

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS in the PPW no later than N~2~ symbols,
defined in clause 6.4 of \[26\], for the subcarrier spacing $\mu$ of the
DL PRS, before the start of the PPW, UE expects to receive the DL
signals/channels and drop all DL PRS in the PPW.

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS in the PPW later than N~2~ symbols, defined
in clause 6.4 of \[26\], for the subcarrier spacing $\mu$ of the DL PRS,
before the start of the PPW, UE is not required to receive the other DL
signals/channels except SSB of higher priority and may receive the DL
PRS in the PPW.

When PRS is lower priority than the DL signals/channels the following
applies for cap 2 UEs:

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS on a PRS symbol no later than N~2~ symbols,
defined in clause 6.4 of \[26\] for the subcarrier spacing $\mu$ of the
DL PRS, before the PRS symbol, UE expects to receive the DL
signals/channels and drop the PRS symbol.

\- If UE determines the presence of other DL signals/channels except SSB
of higher priority than PRS on a PRS symbol later than N~2~ symbols,
defined in clause 6.4 of \[26\] for the subcarrier spacing $\mu$ of the
DL PRS, before the PRS symbol, UE is not required to receive the other
DL signals/channels except SSB of higher priority and may receive the
PRS symbol.

For inter-band case for FR2 for the DL signals/channels from a different
FR2 band than the FR2 band of the DL PRS, if the same Rx beam is used
for both FR2 bands and the DL PRS is determined to be higher priority,
capability 1B and 2 UEs are not expected to receive the DL
signals/channels.

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\],
the time$\ T_{RSTD,Total}$ *s*tarts from the first MG instance aligned
with a DL PRS resource(s) in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation message are delivered from LMF to
the physical layer of UE via LPP \[34\].*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time$\ T_{RSTD,Total}$ starts
from the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in the
assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the RSTD measurement in
each reporting period and activate the location report at the time when
the periodic timer expires.

> Note: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
> scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for DL-TDOA, RSTD and RSRP are performed
over the same measurement period.

When PRS-RSRPP is configured for DL-TDOA, RSTD and RSRPP are performed
over the same measurement period.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured, the measurement period can be
longer.

The measurement requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS
symbols are dropped during the measurement period T~RSTD,Total~ within
measurement gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, the
measurement period can be longer.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if the PRS
resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration
$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if time
span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the minimum number
of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is greater than
UE reported capability N.

The requirements in clause 9.9A.2 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If handover occurs while RSTD measurements are being performed, then the
UE shall continue and complete the on-going RSTD measurements. The RSTD
measurement period can be longer. The UE shall meet the RSTD measurement
accuracy requirements in clause 10.1A.16.2.

##### 9.9A.2.5.2 Measurements Period Requirements without FH without MG

When physical layer receives last of *NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideAssistanceData*
message and *NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF via
LPP \[34\], the RedCap UE shall be able to measure multiple (*up to the
RedCap UE capability specified in clause 9.9A.2.3*) DL RSTD
measurements, defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\], during the measurement period
$T_{RSTD,Total}$ defined as:

$T_{RSTD,Total} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{RSTD\_ wo\_ gap,i} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$,
if any of the positioning frequency layers are in Case 1, or

$T_{i}$ corresponds to *ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT* in TS
37.355 \[34\] if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or
corresponds to the sum of *ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2* and
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN2* in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2*,

$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i} = \ \text{LCM}\left( T_{\text{PRS},i},\text{PPWRP}_{i} \right)$,
the least common multiple between $T_{\text{PRS},i}$ and
$\text{PPWRP}_{i}$.

$\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ PPWRP}_{i}$ is the repetition periodicity of the PRS
processing window applicable for measurements in the positioning
frequency layer *i*.

$T_{\text{PRS},i}$ is the periodicity of DL PRS resource with muting on
positioning frequency layer *i*.

If more than one PRS periodicities are configured in positioning
frequency layer *i*, the least common multiple of PRS periodicities
$T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$ among all DL PRS resource
sets in the positioning frequency layer is used to derive
$T_{\text{PRS},i}$, where,

> ${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,

$N$ is a duration of DL PRS symbols in ms corresponding to
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN* in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or corresponding to
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN2* in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2*.

$N’$ is UE capability for number of DL PRS resources that it can process
in a slot as indicated by ***ppw-maxNumOfDL-PRS-ResProcessedPerSlot***
specified in TS 37.355 \[34\].

The time$\ T_{RSTD\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ *s*tarts from the first instance of
the activated PPW for measurement of positioning frequency layer *i*
aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation message are delivered from LMF to
the physical layer of UE via LPP \[34\].*

When PRS-RSRP is configured for DL-TDOA, RSTD and RSRP are performed
over the same measurement period.

When PRS-RSRPP is configured for DL-TDOA, RSTD and RSRPP are performed
over the same measurement period.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the PPW is re-configured or reactivated, the measurement period
can be longer.

The measurement requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS
symbols are dropped during the measurement period
$T_{RSTD\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ within PPW due to collisions with other signals;
otherwise, the measurement period can be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if the PRS
resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration
$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource, if time
span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the minimum number
of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is greater than
UE reported capability N.

The requirements in clause 9.9A.2 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-TDOA-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If handover occurs while RSTD measurements are being performed, then the
UE shall continue and complete the on-going RSTD measurements. The RSTD
measurement period can be longer. The UE shall meet the RSTD measurement
accuracy requirements in clause 10.1A.16.2.1.

If any *positioning frequency layer is in Case 2, the requirements in
this clause apply provided that the PPWL corresponding to the
positioning frequency layer is larger than (T2+X) ms.*

*The requirements in this clause apply provided that a single
positioning frequency layer is configured for measurement in each PPW.*

##### 9.9A.2.5.3 Measurements Period Requirements without FH with both MG and PPW

If the RedCap UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the UE shall measure positioning frequency layer
*i* within

> \- MG, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
> overlapped with MG, or
>
> \- PPW, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
> overlapped with PPW.

The measurement period $T_{RSTD,Total}$ is defined as:

$T_{RSTD,Total} = T_{RSTD,Total,MG} + \ T_{RSTD,Total,PPW} + \ T_{\text{guard}}$*,*

Where

\- $T_{RSTD,Total,MG}$ is defined in clause 9.9A.2.5.1 and includes all
positioning frequency layers to be measured within MG,

\- $T_{RSTD,Total,PPW}$ is defined in clause 9.9A.2.5.2 and includes all
positioning frequency layers to be measured within PPW,

\- $T_{\text{guard}}$ is the maximum T~effect~ defined in clauses
9.9A.2.5.1 and 9.9A.2.5.2 among all PFLs.

The requirements apply provided the following conditions are satisfied:

\- MGs and PPWs do not overlap in time;

\- Each PFL in the assistance data can be measured completely (all PRS
resources) either within MG or within activated PPW.

#### 9.9A.2.6 Measurements Period Requirements with FH

##### 9.9A.2.6.1 Measurements Period Requirements with FH with MG

When UE physical layer receives last of *NR-TDOA-ProvideAssistanceData*
message and *NR-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF via LPP
\[34\], requesting RedCap UE to measure DL RSTD measurement with FH, the
RedCap UE shall be able to measure multiple (*up to the RedCap UE
capability specified in clause 9.9A.2.3*) DL RSTD measurements, defined*
in TS 38.215 \[4\], during the measurement period $T_{RSTD,Total}$
defined in clause 9.9A.2.5.1 with using the following definition for
$N_{\text{sample}}$ and $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$:

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$ is the number of PRS RSTD measurement samples,
where

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 2 if the RedCap UE supports
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* \[34\], and the LMF
requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number
of samples.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 4 otherwise.

\- A measurement sample with FH is defined as a PRS measurement over
multiple hops within a single measurement gap occasion.

\- $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ *is the time duration of available PRS in the
positioning frequency layer i to be measured during a MG, and is
calculated by:*

$L_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i} = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{J}{N_{\text{hop},i,j}*L_{\text{per} - \text{hop},i,j}}$

where,

\- $N_{hop,i,j}$ is the number of hops that UE can do in an MG occasion
*j* as defined in the following, and

\- $L_{per - hop,i,j}$ is the time duration of available PRS resources
in the positioning frequency layer *i* in each hop to be measured in MG
instance *j* during $T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$, and is
calculated in the same way as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5
of TS 38.214 \[26\]. *For calculation of* $L_{per - hop,i,j}$*, only the
PRS resources unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with* the
sampling duration in each hop *are considered*;

\- *J* is the number of MG instance during
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$.

*The sampling window per hop is the first* $T_{\text{sample},hop}$
*symbols in each hop, where*
$T_{\text{sample},hop} = \ T_{\text{hop}} - \text{RR}T_{\text{FH}}$,
$T_{\text{hop}}$ is the applicable length per hop as defined in table
9.9A.2.6.1-1, and $\text{RR}T_{\text{FH}}$ is the retuning time between
Rx hops as reported by UE in *rf-RxRetuneTimeFR1 or rf-RxRetuneTimeFR2*
via *NR-DL-PRS-ProcessingCapability* \[34\]. The first hop within a MG
instance starts at no earlier than the earliest arrival time of the
first unmuted PRS resource fully or partially overlapped with the MG
instance taking into account the *expectedRSTD* and
*expectedRSTD-uncertainty* in the PRS assistance data.

The number of hops within a single MG occasion $N_{hop,i,j}$ is defined
as

$N_{\text{hop},i,j} = \min\left( N_{\text{hops},\text{effect},i,j},\left\lfloor \frac{{N3}_{i}}{L_{\text{per} - \text{hop},i,j}} \right\rfloor,N_{\text{hop},\max,i} \right)$

where

\- $N_{hop,max,i}$ is the maximum number of Rx hops signaled by UE in
*maximumFH-Hops* via *NR-DL-PRS-ProcessingCapability* as specified in
\[34\] for positioning frequency layer *i*

\- ${N3}_{i}$ is indicated via UE capability
*processingPRS-SymbolsDurationN3-r18* for positioning frequency layer
*i*

\- $N_{hops,effect,i,j}$ is the effective number of Rx hops within a MG
instance *j*,

\- $N_{hops,effect,i,j} = 2*N_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}}$, if
$N_{\text{hops}}^{\text{slot}}$ = 2,

$N_{\text{hops}}^{\text{slot}}$ = 1,

\- $N_{hops,effect,i,j} = N_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}}$, if
$N_{\text{hops}}^{\text{slot}}$ = 1/2 and $M_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}}$

\-
$N_{hops,effect,i,j} = \left\lfloor \frac{\left( N_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}} - 1 \right)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1$,
if $N_{\text{hops}}^{\text{slot}}$ = 1/2 and
$M_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}}$ =1,

repetitions within the MG occasion, excluding the gap retuning times,

provided all PRS resources in each PFL have the same number of PRS
repetitions $\left( N_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}} \right)$ within an MG
instance and the same PRS repetition interval
$\left( M_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}} \right)$, otherwise the measurement

over the BW of $\text{BW}_{\text{total}}$ defined as

$$\text{BW}_{\text{total}} = min\left( \text{BW}_{\text{PRS}},N_{\text{hop}}*\text{BW}_{per - hop} - \left( N_{\text{hop}} - 1 \right)*\text{BW}_{\text{overlap}} \right)$$

#### 9.9A.3.5 Measurements Period Requirements without FH

##### 9.9A.3.5.1 Measurement Period Requirements without FH with MG

When the physical layer receives *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData*
message and *NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF* via
LPP \[34\], the RedCap UE shall be able to measure multiple (up to the
RedCapUE capability specified in clause 9.9A.3.3) PRS-RSRP measurements,
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], from configured PRS resources for configured
TRPs on configured positioning frequency layers, within
$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ ms.

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$

If positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL PRS resource set
with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among the DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where:

> $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the periodicity of PRS resource sets
> given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-Periodicity*.
>
> $N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
> muting.

> where $T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the muting repetition factor
> given by the higher-layer parameter

> size of the bitmap $\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$.
>
> NOTE: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
> fully or partially covered by the MG are considered.

When PRS-RSRP measurements are configured for DL-AoD, except for
deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time
$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ starts from the first MG instance aligned
with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time$\ T_{PRS - RSRP,total}$
starts from the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in
the assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the PRS-RSRP measurement
in each reporting period and activate the location report at the time
when the periodic timer expires.

> Note: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
> scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with RSTD
measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the* RSTD
measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.2.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the UE
Rx-Tx time difference* measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9.4.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within duration
$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the MG pattern is reconfigured either per UE request or not per
UE request, the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period $T_{PRS - RSRP,\ total}$ within
measurement gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a
longer measurement period may be used.

The requirements in clause 9.9A.3 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If handover occurs while PRS-RSRP measurements are being performed then
the UE shall complete the ongoing PRS-RSRP measurements session. The
PRS-RSRP measurement period can be longer. The UE shall meet the
PRS-RSRP measurement accuracy requirements in clause 10.1A.17.2.

##### 9.9A.3.5.2 Measurement Period Requirements without FH without MG

When the physical layer receives *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData*
message and *NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF* via
LPP \[34\], the RedCap UE shall be able to measure multiple (up to the
RedCap UE capability specified in clause 9.9A.3.3) PRS-RSRP measurements
as defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] without measurement gap, on configured
positioning frequency layer *i*, within $T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$
ms.

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{L}{T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \left( L - 1 \right)*\max\left( T_{effect,i} \right)}$
*if any of the positioning frequency layers are in Case 1, or*

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = max\left( T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,i}} + \text{T}_{\text{uncertainty,i}} \right)$*,
if all the positioning frequency layers are in Case 2,*

Where,

If positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL PRS resource set
with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among the DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where:

$T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the periodicity of PRS resource sets
given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-Periodicity*.

$N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
muting. If bitmap $\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$ for higher-layer parameter
*DL-*$N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
muting.
$N_{\text{muting}} = T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}*L_{\text{muting}}$,
where $T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the muting repetition factor
given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-MutingBitRepetitionFactor*,
and $L_{\text{muting}}$ is the size of the bitmap
$\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$.

> Note: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
> that meet the applicability conditions and fully or partially covered
> by the PRS processing window are considered.

When PRS-RSRP measurements are configured for DL-AoD, the time
$T_{PRS - RSRP,i}$ starts from the first PRS processing window instance
aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

> Note: No per-positioning frequency layer requirement is applied in
> scenarios when multiple positioning frequency layers are configured.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with RSTD
measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the* RSTD
measurement requirements defined in clause 9.9A.2.

*When the PRS-RSRP measurement is configured together with UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement then the PRS-RSRP measurement shall meet the UE
Rx-Tx time difference* measurement requirements defined in clause
9.9A.4.

If CSSF changes during the measurement period, the measurement period
could be longer.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

\- if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

\- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

The requirements in clause 9.9A.3 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities, and
it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured, subject
to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

If during the measurement period of one or more positioning frequency
layers, the PPW is reconfigured or reactivated, the PRS-RSRP
*measurement period can be longer*.

If any *positioning frequency layer is in Case 2, the requirements in
this clause apply provided that the PPWL corresponding to the
positioning frequency layer is larger than (T2+X) ms.*

*The requirements in this clause apply provided that a single
positioning frequency layer is configured for measurement in each PPW.*

##### 9.9A.3.5.3 Measurements Period Requirements without FH with both MG and PPW

If the RedCap UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the UE shall measure positioning frequency layer
*i* within

\- MG, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with MG, or

\- PPW, if PRS resources on positioning frequency layer *i* are
overlapped with PPW.

The measurement period $T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}}$ is defined as:

$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,\ total}} = T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,MG} + \ T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,PPW} + \ T_{\text{guard}}$*,*

Where

*-* $T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,MG}$ is defined in clause 9.9A.3.5.1 and
includes all positioning frequency layers to be measured within MG,

*-* $T_{PRS - RSRP,Total,PPW}$ is defined in clause 9.9A.3.5.2 and
includes all positioning frequency layers to be measured within PPW,

*-* $T_{\text{guard}}$ is the maximum T~effect~ defined in clauses
9.9A.3.5.1 and 9.9A.3.5.2 among all PFLs.

The requirements apply provided the following conditions are satisfied:

\- MGs and PPWs do not overlap in time;

\- Each PFL in the assistance data can be measured completely (all PRS
resources) either within MG or within activated PPW.

#### 9.9A.3.6 Measurements Period Requirements with FH

##### 9.9A.3.6.1 Measurements Period Requirements with FH with MG

When the UE the physical layer receives
*NR-DL-AoD-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF* via LPP \[34\],
*requesting RedCap UE to measure* PRS-RSRP *measurement with FH*, the
RedCap UE shall be able to measure multiple (up to the RedCapUE
capability specified in clause 9.9A.3.3) PRS-RSRP measurements, defined
in TS 38.215 \[4\], from configured PRS resources for configured TRPs on
configured positioning frequency layers, within
$T_{PRS - RSRP\text{,total}}$ ms as defined clause 9.9A.3.5.1 with using
the following definition for $N_{\text{sample}}$ and
$L_{available\_ PRS,i}$:

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$ is the number of PRS-RSRP measurement samples,
where

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 2 if the UE supports
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* \[34\], and the LMF
requests the UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number
of samples.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 4 otherwise.

\- A measurement sample with FH is defined as a PRS measurement over
multiple hops within a single measurement gap occasion.

\- $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ *is the time duration of available PRS in the
positioning frequency layer i to be measured during a MG, and is
calculated by:*

$L_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i} = \ \sum_{j = 1}^{J}{N_{\text{hop},i,j}*L_{\text{per} - \text{hop},i,j}}$

where,

\- $N_{hop,i,j}$ is the number of hops that UE can do in an MG occasion
*j* as defined in the following, and

\- $L_{per - hop,i,j}$ is the time duration of available PRS resources
in the positioning frequency layer *i* in each hop to be measured in MG
instance *j* during $T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$, and is
calculated in the same way as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5
of TS 38.214 \[26\]. *For calculation of* $L_{per - hop,i,j}$*, only the
PRS resources unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with* the
sampling duration in each hop *are considered*;

\- *J* is the number of MG instance during
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$.

*The sampling window per hop is the first* $T_{\text{sample},hop}$
*symbols in each hop, where*
$T_{\text{sample},hop} = \ T_{\text{hop}} - \text{RR}T_{\text{FH}}$,
$T_{\text{hop}}$ is the applicable length per hop as defined in table
9.9A.3.6.1-1, and $\text{RR}T_{\text{FH}}$ is the retuning time between
Rx hops as reported by UE in *rf-RxRetuneTimeFR1 or rf-RxRetuneTimeFR2*
via *NR-DL-PRS-ProcessingCapability* \[34\]. The first hop within a MG
instance starts at no earlier than the earliest arrival time of the
first unmuted PRS resource fully or partially overlapped with the MG
instance taking into account the *expectedRSTD* and
*expectedRSTD-uncertainty* in the PRS assistance data.

The number of hops within a single MG occasion $N_{hop,i,j}$ is defined
as

$N_{\text{hop},i,j} = \min\left( N_{\text{hops},\text{effect},i,j},\left\lfloor \frac{{N3}_{i}}{L_{\text{per} - \text{hop},i,j}} \right\rfloor,N_{\text{hop},\max,i} \right)$

LPP specified in TS 37.355 \[34\] requesting the UE to measure and
report one or more UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements defined in TS
38.215 \[4\].

If UE does not support RX FH for PRS measurement as indicated by UE

*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* in the measurement request,
the requirements in clauses 9.9A.4.5, 9.9A.4.6 and 9.9A.4.7 shall apply
for applicable configurations.

If UE supports RX FH for PRS measurement as indicated by UE capability
*NR-DL-PRS-ProcessingCapability*, and LMF requests UE to use RX FH for
PRS measurement as indicated via
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* in the measurement request,
the requirements in clause 9.9A.4.8 shall apply.

#### 9.9A.4.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9A.4 apply for periodic and triggered UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurements, provided:

> \- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement related side conditions given
> in clause 10.1A.18.2 are met for a corresponding band.

\- SRS is configured on at least one of the PCell, PSCell and SCell.

\- The UE transmits SRS within \[-160, 160\] msec of at least one DL PRS

#### 9.9A.4.7 Measurements Period Requirements without FH with both MG and PPW

The requirements in clause 9.9.4.8 shall apply.

#### 9.9A.4.8 Measurements Period Requirements with FH

The requirements in this clause apply when a RedCap UE is requested by
the LMF to perform measurements with FH, and UE reports measurement
based on multiple hops.

The requirements in clause 9.9A.4.5 shall apply with the following
modifications.

\- $N_{\text{sample}}$= 2 if the UE supports the capability of
positioning measurements with reduced number of samples as indicated by
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples-RRC-CONNECTED* specified in TS 37.355
\[34\], and the LMF requests the UE to perform positioning measurements
with reduced number of samples. Otherwise, $N_{\text{sample}}$= 4.

\- A measurement sample with FH is defined as a PRS measurement over
multiple hops within a single measurement gap.

\-
$L_{\text{available}\_ PRS,i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{J}{N_{hop,i,j}*L_{per - hop,i,j}}$,
where

\- $N_{hop,i,j}$ is the number of hops that UE can do in an MG occasion
*j* as defined in the following, and

\- $L_{per - hop,i,j}$ is the time duration of available PRS resources
in the positioning frequency layer *i* in each hop to be measured in MG
instance *j* during $T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$, and is
calculated in the same way as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5
of TS 38.214 \[26\]. *For calculation of* $L_{per - hop,i,j}$*, only the
PRS resources unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with* the
sampling duration in each hop *are considered*;

\- *J* is the number of MG instance during
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$.

*The sampling window per hop is the first* $T_{\text{sample},hop}$
*symbols in each hop, where*
$T_{\text{sample},hop} = \ T_{\text{hop}} - \text{RR}T_{\text{FH}}$,
$T_{\text{hop}}$ is the applicable length per hop as defined in table
9.9A.4.8-1, and $\text{RR}T_{\text{FH}}$ is the retuning time between Rx
hops as reported by UE in *rf-RxRetuneTimeFR1 or rf-RxRetuneTimeFR2* via
*NR-DL-PRS-ProcessingCapability specified in* TS 37.355 \[34\]. The
first hop within a MG instance starts at no earlier than the earliest
arrival time of the first unmuted PRS resource fully or partially
overlapped with the MG instance taking into account the *expectedRSTD*
and *expectedRSTD-uncertainty* in the PRS assistance data.

The number of hops within a single MG occasion $N_{hop,i,j}$ is defined
as

$N_{\text{hop},i,j} = \min\left( N_{\text{hops},\text{effect},i,j},\left\lfloor \frac{{N3}_{i}}{L_{\text{per} - \text{hop},i,j}} \right\rfloor,N_{\text{hop},\max,i} \right)$

where

### 9.9A.5 PRS-RSRPP measurements for RedCap

#### 9.9A.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for RedCap UE, when the UE
received *NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP
\[34\] requesting the UE to measure and report one or more PRS-RSRPP
measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

If UE does not support FH for PRS measurement as indicated by UE
capability *NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities*, or if LMF does not request
UE to use FH for PRS measurement as indicated via
*NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* in the measurement request, the
requirements in clauses 9.9A.5.5, 9.9A.5.6 and 9.9A.5.7 shall apply for
applicable configurations.

If UE supports FH for PRS measurement as indicated by UE capability
*NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities*, and LMF requests UE to use FH for PRS
measurement as indicated via *NR-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* in
the measurement request, the requirements in clause 9.9A.5.8 shall
apply.

#### 9.9A.5.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9A.5 apply for periodic and triggered
PRS-RSRPP measurements, provided:

\- PRS-RSRPP related side conditions given in clause 10.1A.19.2 are met
for a corresponding band.

#### 9.9A.5.3 Measurement Capability

UE PRS-RSRPP measurement capability is as indicated by the UE in
*NR-DL-AoD-ProvideCapabilities* according to TS 37.355 \[34\].

#### 9.9A.5.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes the delay uncertainty caused by inserting the measurement
report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The reported PRS-RSRPP measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1A.19.3.

The PRS-RSRPP measurement accuracy for all measured PRS resources shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy requriements specified in the
clause 10.1A.19.2.

#### 9.9A.5.5 Measurement Period Requirements without FH with MG

For PRS measurement within MG configured to UE, measurement period
requirements for PRS-RSRP defined in clause 9.9A.3.5.1 is re-used for
PRS-RSRPP.

#### 9.9A.5.6 Measurement Period Requirements without FH without MG

For PRS measurement without MG configured to UE, measurement period
requirements for PRS-RSRP defined in clause 9.9A.3.5.2 is re-used for
PRS-RSRPP.

The PRS-RSRPP measurement requirements in this clause apply for the
first path PRS-RSRP measurement.

#### 9.9A.5.7 Measurements Period Requirements without FH with both MG and PPW

If the UE is configured with both MG applicable to positioning
measurement and PPW, the measurement period requirements for PRS-RSRP
defined in clause 9.9A.3.5.3 is re-used for PRS-RSRPP.

#### 9.9A.5.8 Measurements Period Requirements with FH 

The measurement period requirements for PRS-RSRP defined in clause
9.9A.3.6 are re-used for PRS-RSRPP.

9.9C NR measurements for positioning in Satellite Access
--------------------------------------------------------

### 9.9C.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements for UE capable of performing NR
positioning measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], including UE Rx-Tx
time difference , when the PCell is served by a Satellite Access Node
(SAN).

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

#### 9.9C.1.1 General Aspects of Gap-based Measurement

For gap-based UE Rx-Tx time difference, the requirements in clauses
9.9C.4.5 apply provided:

\- the UE is configured or pre-configured with measurement gaps or
configured with concurrent measurement gaps

\- all positioning frequency layers are measured or associated with only
one per-UE measurement gap, or

\- if the measurement gap is pre-configured, the gap must be activated
throughout the measurement period, and

\- if concurrent measurement gaps are configured, one of the gap
combinations specified in clause 9.1.8.2 is configured, and

\- if the UE does not support *independentGapConfigPRS-r17*, the
configured or pre-configured gap used to perform the PRS measurements
must be of per-UE type, and

\- No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement gaps for PRS
measurement, and

All measurement requirements specified in clause 9.9C.4.5 shall apply
without DRX as well as for any DRX configuration specified in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are fully or partially
overlapped with measurement gaps, and the requirements in clause
9.9C.4.5 and are applicable to PRS resources that are fully or partially
overlapped with measurement gaps.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with
measurement gaps if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a
measurement gap occasion. A PRS resource instance is considered to be
overlapped with measurement gap occasion if the minimum number of
unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into account *nr-DL-
PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty* and *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD* is fully
covered by the MGL excluding RF switching time, where the minimum number
is given in the accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.25C, for UE Rx-Tx
time difference .

When UE is configured with measurement for more than one positioning
requests, the measurement period for each request may be longer than
measurement period when UE is configured with measurement for single
positioning request.

If a positioning measurement gap is configured via *PosGapConfig* and
activated by MAC CE, the measurement requirements in clause 9.9.4C.5
apply provided that no other MGs are configured, and only one
measurement gap configured via *PosGapConfig* is activated.

#### 9.9C.1.2 General Aspects of Gapless Measurement

The requirements for UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement without
measurement gaps specified in clause 9.9C.4.6 shall apply provided that:

Positioning frequency layer to be measured is within an active BWP,

UE is configured with PPW, and the PPW for the active BWP containing the
positioning frequency layer to be measured is activated,

No active BWP switching occurs during the measurement period specified
in clauses 9.9.2.7, 9.9.3.6, 9.9.4.6, and 9.9.6.6,

PRS is within PPW and does not overlap with other signals/channels of
higher priority,

\- for PPW type 1A/1B, the PPW does not overlap with any symbol for
SSB-based RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB
based RRM measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement
gaps,

\- for PPW type 2, PRS does not overlap with any symbol for SSB-based
RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement on any CC or for SSB based RRM
measurement on any MOs that are measured outside measurement gaps,

SCS of PRS within PPW and SCS of DL active BWP are the same.

All measurement requirements specified in clause 9.9C.4.6 shall apply
without DRX as well as for any DRX configuration specified in TS 38.331
\[2\].

The UE is not required to perform additional SSB measurement for the SSB
configured as QCL source of PRS resources.

The UE is only required to measure PRS resources that are unmuted and
fully or partially overlapped with PPW, and the requirements in clause
9.9C.4.6 are applicable to PRS resources that are unmuted and fully or
partially overlapped with PPW.

A PRS resource is considered to be fully (partially) overlapped with PPW
if all (some) of its instances are overlapped with a PPW occasion. A PRS
resource instance is considered to be overlapped with PPW occasion if
the minimum number of unmuted repetitions of the instance taking into
account Rx time difference between serving and non-serving cell is fully
covered by the PPW, where the minimum number is given in the accuracy
requirements in clause 10.1.25C for UE Rx-Tx time difference.

When UE is configured with measurement for more than one positioning
requests, the measurement period for each request may be longer than
measurement period when UE is configured with measurement for single
positioning request.

#### 9.9C.1.3 Scheduling Availability of UE during PRS Measurement without Measurement Gaps

The requirements in clause 9.9.1.3 apply for UE performing UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement without measurement gaps according to clause
9.9C.4.6.

### 9.9C.2 Void

### 9.9C.3 Void

### 9.9C.4 UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements

#### 9.9C.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to measure and report one or more UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

#### 9.9C.4.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.9C.4 apply for periodic and triggered UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurements, provided:

> \- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement related side conditions given
> in clause 10.1.25C are met for a corresponding band.

\- SRS is configured on the PCell.

\- The UE transmits SRS within \[-160, 160\] msec of the DL PRS resource
of the TRP corresponding to the PCell in the assistance data.

#### 9.9C.4.3 Measurement Capability

UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement capability is as indicated by the
UE in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,* according to TS 37.355 \[34\].

#### 9.9C.4.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement
report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement values contained in measurement
reports shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25C.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy for all measured DL
PRS resources shall be fulfilled according to the accuracy requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25C.

#### 9.9C.4.5 Measurement Period Requirements

When physical layer receives last of
*NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF via LPP
\[34\], UE shall be able to measure multiple* (up to the UE capability
specified in clause 9.9C.4.3) *UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements as
defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\] from its PCell in a single configured
positioning frequency layer *i* within the measurement period
$T_{UERxTx,i}$ ms.

Measurement period $T_{UERxTx,i}$ is defined as

$$T_{UERxTx,i} = \left( \text{CSSF}_{i}*ceil\left( K_{p,PRS,i} \right)*\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{available\_ PRS\text{,i}}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last},i}$$

Where

> $\text{CSSF}_{i}$ is the carrier-specific scaling factor for NR
> PRS-based measurement in the positioning frequency layer *i* as
> defined in clause 9.1.5.2,

$K_{p,PRS,i}$ is a scaling factor for a positioning frequency layer to
be measured within the associated measurement gap pattern, which is
defined as $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = **N~total~ / N~available~ for UE configured
with concurrent measurement gap, and** $K_{p,PRS,i}$ = 1 **for UE not
configured with concurrent measurement gap**.

For a window W of duration max($T_{PRS,i}$~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max
is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG and per-FR MG within
the same FR as the positioning frequency layer, and starting at the
beginning of any associated gap occasions covering the PRS occasion:

**N~total~ is the total number of** associated gap occasions covering
**PRS occasions within the window,** including both dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within **the
window, and**

**N~available~ is the number of non-dropped** associated gap occasions
covering **PRS occasions within the window W, after further accounting
for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision rule**

Requirements do not apply if **N~available~** =0.

$L_{\text{available}\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS
resources in the positioning frequency layer *i*, to be measured during
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$, and is calculated in the same way
as PRS duration K defined in clause 5.1.6.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\]. *For
calculation of* $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$*, only the PRS resources unmuted
and fully or partially overlapped with MG are considered.*

$N_{PRS,i}^{\text{slot}}$ is the maximum number of DL PRS resources of
positioning frequency layer i configured in a slot,

$\{ N,T\}$ is UE capability combination per band where N is a duration
of DL PRS symbols in ms corresponding to
*durationOfPRS-ProcessingSysmbols* in TS 37.355 \[34\] processed every T
ms corresponding to *durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsInEveryTms* in TS
37.355 \[34\] for a given maximum bandwidth supported by UE
corresponding to *supportedBandwidthPRS* in clause 4.2.7.2 of TS 37.355
\[34\],

$N’$ is UE capability for number of DL PRS resources that it can process
in a slot corresponding to *maxNumOfDL-PRS-ResProcessedPerSlot* as
specified in clause 6.4.3 of TS 37.355 \[34\],

> $N_{\text{sample}}$ is the number of UE Rx-Tx time difference
> measurement samples and $N_{\text{sample}} = 1$.

$\text{T}_{\text{last,i}}$ is the measurement duration for the last UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurement sample in the positioning layer i,
including the sampling time and processing time,
$\text{T}_{\text{last,i}}$ *=* $T_{\text{i}}$ *+*
$T_{available\_ PRS\text{,i}}$ ,

$T_{effect,i}$ is periodicity of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement in
positioning frequency layer *i*:

$T_{effect,i} = \ \left\lceil \frac{T_{i}}{T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}} \right\rceil*T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS},i}$

where

$T_{i}$ corresponds to *durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsInEveryTms* in TS
37.355 \[34\],

$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}} = \ \text{LCM}\left( T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}},\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}} \right)$,
the least common multiple between $T_{PRS,i}$ and
$\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}}$

> $\text{MGRP}_{\text{i}}$ is the measurement gap repetition periodicity
> in positioning frequency layer *i*.

$T_{PRS,i}$ is the PRS resource periodicity in positioning frequency
layer *i*. If the positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL
PRS resource sets with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where

> $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the periodicity of PRS resource sets
> given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-Periodicity*.
>
> $N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
> muting.
> $N_{\text{muting}} = T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}*L_{\text{muting}}$,
> where $T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the muting repetition factor
> given by the higher-layer parameter
> *DL-PRS-MutingBitRepetitionFactor*, and $L_{\text{muting}}$ is the
> size of the bitmap $\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$

NOTE: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
fully or partially covered by the MG are considered.

Except for deferred MT-LR as defined in clause 4.1a.5 TS 23.273 \[44\],
the time $T_{UERxTx,Total}$ starts from the first MG instance aligned
with DL PRS resources in the assistance data after both the
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

For deferred MT-LR with other event than "Periodic Location" as defined
in clause 4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the time$\ T_{UERxTx,Total}$ starts
from the first MG instance aligned with a DL PRS resource(s) in the
assistance data after the associated event(s) occurs.

For deferred MT-LR with event "Periodic Location" as defined in clause
4.1a.5.1 TS 23.273 \[44\], the UE shall perform the PRS-RSRP measurement
in each reporting period and activate the location report at the time
when the periodic timer expires.

When HO occurs during the measurement period, UE shall stop PRS
measurement for the source cell after HO occurs, and shall start PRS
measurement for the target cell after SRS reconfiguration on the target
cell is complete.

When satellite switch with re-sync occurs during the measurement period,
UE shall stop PRS measurement at *t-Service* if hard switching is
applicable, or at *t-ServiceStart* if soft switching is applicable, and
shall start PRS measurement after the switch is complete.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

\- if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or

\- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements) is
greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period, the MG pattern is reconfigured either
per UE request or not per UE request, the measurement period can be
longer.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period T~UERxTx,Total~ within measurement
gaps due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a longer
measurement period may be used.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

The requirements in clause 9.9C.4 do not apply if the PRS configuration
given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData* exceeds any
of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured,
subject to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

When SRS is reconfigured without serving cell change during the
measurement period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement after the SRS reconfiguration is complete.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the network-configured
Timing Advance command during the UE Rx-Tx *time difference* measurement
period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is
restarted after uplink transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 during the UE Rx-Tx *time
difference* measurement period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period is restarted after uplink transmission timing
changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period
requirements in this clause shall not apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1C.2 during the UE Rx-Tx *time
difference* measurement period, then:

\- UE Rx-Tx *time difference* measurement period requirements in this
clause shall apply for a cell, which is also the downlink reference cell
(defined in clause 7.1C.1) for SRS transmission.

#### 9.9C.4.6 Measurement Period Requirements without Measurement Gaps

When physical layer receives last of
*NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData* message and
*NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message from LMF via LPP
\[34\], UE shall be able to measure multiple* (up to the UE capability
specified in clause 9.9C.4.3) *UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements as
defined* in TS 38.215 \[4\] from its Pcell in a single configured
positioning frequency layer *i* within the measurement period
$T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ ms.

In the following requirements, a positioning frequency layer *i* is in
Case 1 if UE reports *ppw-durationOfPRS-Processing1-r17* for the band
containing the positioning frequency layer, and a positioning frequency
layer is in Case 2 if UE reports *ppw-durationOfPRS-Processing2-r17* for
the band containing the positioning frequency layer.

Measurement period $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ is defined as

$T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i} = {\left( \left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil\left\lceil \frac{L_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}}}{N} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}} - 1 \right)*T}_{effect,i} + \text{T}_{\text{last},i}$

Where

> $T_{effect,i}$ is the periodicity of the UE Rx-Tx time difference
> measurement in positioning frequency layer i as defined further in
> this clause.
>
> $L_{\text{available}\_ PRS,i}$ is the time duration of available PRS

> \[26\]. *For calculation of* $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$*,*

only the unmuted PRS resources that meet the applicability conditions
and fully or partially overlapped with PRS processing window are
considered, if positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1, or

only the PRS resources unmuted and fully or partially overlapped with
the first (PPWL-T2) ms of PPW are considered, if positioning frequency
layer i is in Case 2, where PPWL is the PPW length and T2 corresponds to
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2*.

> $N_{PRS,i}^{\text{slot}}$ is the maximum number of DL PRS resources of
> positioning frequency layer i configured in a slot,
>
> $\{ N,T\}$ is UE capability combination per band where N is a duration

> *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2*,
>
> $N’$ is UE capability for number of DL PRS resources that it can

>
> $\text{T}_{\text{last,i}}$ is the measurement duration for the last UE
> Rx-Tx time difference measurement sample in the positioning layer i,
> including the sampling time and processing time.

If *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1 and* all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = $T_{\text{i}}$ +PPWL,
else

if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2 and* all of the PRS
resources to be measured are available in the same PPW occasion during
T~available~, then $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ = PPWL;

otherwise, $\text{T}_{\text{last},i}$ **=** $T_{\text{i}}$ **+**
$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}}$**.**

> $T_{effect,i}$ is periodicity of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
> in positioning frequency layer *i*:

$T_{effect,i} = \ \left\lceil \frac{T_{i}}{T_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}} \right\rceil*T_{\text{availabl}e_{\text{PRS}},i}$

where

$T_{i}$ corresponds to ***ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT*** in TS
37.355 \[34\] if *positioning frequency layer i is in Case 1*, or
corresponds to the sum of *ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsT2* and
*ppw-durationOfPRS-ProcessingSymbolsN2* in TS 37.355 \[34\] if
*positioning frequency layer i is in Case 2*,

$T_{\text{available}\_\text{PRS}\text{,i}} = \ \text{LCM}\left( T_{\text{PRS}\text{,i}},\text{PPWRP}_{\text{i}} \right)$,
the least common multiple between $T_{PRS,i}$ and
$\text{PPWRP}_{\text{i}}$

$\text{PPWRP}_{\text{i}}$ is the PRS processing window repetition
periodicity in positioning frequency layer *i*.

$T_{PRS,i}$ is the PRS resource periodicity in positioning frequency
layer *i*. If the positioning frequency layer *i* has more than one DL
PRS resource sets with different PRS periodicities with muting,
${T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}} = N}_{\text{muting}}*T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$,
the least common multiple of $T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS\ with\ muting}}$
among DL PRS resource sets is used to derive $T_{PRS,i}$, where

$T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the periodicity of PRS resource sets
given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-Periodicity*.

$N_{\text{muting}}$ is the scaling factor considering PRS resource
muting.
$N_{\text{muting}} = T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}*L_{\text{muting}}$,
where $T_{\text{muting}}^{\text{PRS}}$ is the muting repetition factor
given by the higher-layer parameter *DL-PRS-MutingBitRepetitionFactor*,
and $L_{\text{muting}}$ is the size of the bitmap
$\left\{ b^{1} \right\}$

NOTE: For the purpose of calculating T~PRS,i~, only the PRS resources
that meet the applicability conditions and fully or partially covered by
the PRS processing window are considered.

The time $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ starts from the first PRS processing
window instance aligned with DL PRS resources in the assistance data
after both the *NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation message and
NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideAssistanceData message from LMF via LPP \[34\] are
delivered to the physical layer of UE.*

When HO occurs during the measurement period, UE shall stop PRS
measurement for the source cell after HO occurs, and shall start PRS
measurement for the target cell after SRS reconfiguration on the target
cell is complete.

When satellite switch with re-sync occurs during the measurement period,
UE shall stop PRS measurement at *t-Service* if hard switching is
applicable, or at *t-ServiceStart* if soft switching is applicable, and
shall start PRS measurement after the switch is complete.

The measurement requirements do not apply for a PRS resource:

> \- if the PRS resource is across two sampling duration of N within
> duration $L_{available\_ PRS,i}$ or
>
> \- if time span of the PRS resource instance (including at least the
> minimum number of repetitions specified in the accuracy requirements)
> is greater than UE reported capability N.

If during the measurement period, the PRS processing window is
reconfigured or reactivated either per UE request or not per UE request,
the measurement period can be longer.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided no PRS symbols are
dropped during the measurement period $T_{UERxTx\_ wo\_ gap,i}$ within
PRS processing window due to collisions with other signals; otherwise, a
longer measurement period may be used.

When PRS-RSRP is configured for multi-RTT, the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurements and PRS-RSRP measurements are performed over the same
measurement period.

The requirements in clause 9.9C.4.6 do not apply if the PRS
configuration given by higher layer paramters *NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceData*
exceeds any of the UE measurement capabilities given by
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourcesCapability* in *NR-Multi-RTT-ProvideCapabilities,
and it is up to UE implementation which PRS resources are measured,
subject to* UE measurement capabilities*.*

*W*hen SRS is reconfigured without cell change during the measurement
period, UE shall restart the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement after
the SRS reconfiguration on the target cell is complete.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the network-configured
Timing Advance command during the UE Rx-Tx *time difference* measurement
period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period is
restarted after uplink transmission timing changes, and the UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurement period requirements in this clause shall not
apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the change in the
N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1C.2-2 during the UE Rx-Tx *time
difference* measurement period, then the UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement period is restarted after uplink transmission timing
changes, and the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement period
requirements in this clause shall not apply.

If UE uplink transmission timing changes due to the UE autonomous timing
adjustment defined in clause 7.1C.2 during the UE Rx-Tx *time
difference* measurement period, then:

> \- UE Rx-Tx *time difference* measurement period requirements in this

If any positioning frequency layer is in Case 2, the requirements in
this clause apply provided that the PPWL corresponding to the
positioning frequency layer is larger than (T2+X) ms.

The requirements in this clause apply provided that a single positioning
frequency layer is configured for measurement in each PPW.

9.10 CSI-RS based L3 measurements
---------------------------------

### 9.10.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the UE regarding CSI-RS
based measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements
are split in intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements
requirements.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided:

\- Only one MO is configured per CSI-RS frequency layer, and

\- all CSI-RS resources in the same MO are configured with the same
*csi-rs-MeasurementBW*, and

\- *associatedSSB* is configured in *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and
detectable, and

\- all CSI-RS resources in the same MO are configured with the same
periodicity, and

\- the associated SSB is QCLed with the corresponding CSI-RS resources
in FR2, and

\- the number of CSI-RS resources in any duration that equals to the
length of a slot is no larger than UE capability
*maxNumberCSI-RS-RRM-RS-SINR*.

\- When there are mixed numerologies, the length of a slot is defined
based on the smallest SCS

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.10.2 CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements

#### 9.10.2.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement
provided that:

\- the SCS of the CSI-RS resource of the neighbour cell configured for
measurement is the same as the SCS of the CSI-RS resource on the serving
cell indicated for measurement, and

\- the CP type of the CSI-RS resource of neighbour cell configured for
measurement is the same as the CP type of the CSI-RS resource of the
serving cell indicated for measurement, and

\- It is applied for SCS = 60KHz

\- the centre frequency of the CSI-RS resource of the neighbour cell
configured for measurement is the same as the centre frequency of the
CSI-RS resource of the serving cell indicated for measurement

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR measurements of identified
intra-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell or the PSCell.

No measurement gap is needed for intra-frequency CSI-RS resources
measurements.

For intra-frequency CSI-RS based measurements, UE may cause scheduling
restriction as specified in clause 9.10.2.6.

Note: Extended CP for CSI-RS based measurement is not supported in this
release.

#### 9.10.2.2 Requirements applicability

The measurement of the associated SSB follows the same requirements as
SSB based measurements defined in clause 9.2.

The requirements in clause 9.10.2 apply, provided:

\- Only one intra-frequency CSI-RS layer per serving cell is configured,
and

\- The BW of the CSI-RS on the intra-frequency neighbor cell is within
the active BWP of the UE, and

\- The associated SSB of the CSI-RS resources being identified or
measured are detectable, and the CSI-RS resources configured for CSI-RS
based L3 measurements are measurable, and

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS resources of intra-MO is the same as that of
the CSI-RS resources configured for the serving cell, and

\- All CSI-RS resources on one intra-frequency layer are configured
within up to two separate windows where each window is up to 5 ms, and

\- for the case of single window further provided

\- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 10 ms, 20 ms or
40 ms

\- for the case of two separate windows further provided

\- The two windows are either both fully non-overlapped with MG or both
partially overlapped with MG

> \- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 20 ms or 40
> ms

\- The starting point of the first window is the slot boundary of the
serving cell, where the corresponding slot contains the configured L3
CSI-RS resource of the serving cell in the servingCellMO with the
smallest offset, and

> \- The starting point of the second window if configured is determined
> by an offset of half of the CSI-RS periodicity in slots with regards
> to the starting point of the first window, and

\- Numerology for intra-frequency CSI-RS and data of serving cell are
the same.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant associated SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2.1 and
10.1.3.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7.1 and
10.1.8.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12.1 and
10.1.13.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource shall be considered measurable when for each relevant
CSI-RS resource:

\- CSI-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2.3 and
10.1.3.3 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7.2 and
10.1.8.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12.2 and
10.1.13.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.12 for a
corresponding band.

#### 9.10.2.3 Number of cells and number of CSI-RS

##### 9.10.2.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 32 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI on the
intra-frequency layer, and

\- the cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB

##### 9.10.2.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For one single intra-frequency CSI-RS layer in a band, during each layer
1 measurement period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP,
CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 32 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI, and

\- the cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB.

where this single intra-frequency layer shall be:

\- PCC on which UE is configured to report CSI-RS measurement when UE is
configured with SA NR operation mode with PCC in the band; or

\- PSCC on which UE is configured to report CSI-RS measurement when UE
is configured with EN-DC with PSCC in the band; or

\- One of the SCCs on which UE is configured to report CSI-RS based
measurements when neither PCC nor PSCC is in the same band, so that the
selected SCC shall be an SCC where the UE is configured with CSI-RSRP
measurement reporting if such SCC exists, otherwise the selected SCC is
determined by UE implementation.

The UE shall also be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least 2 CSI-RSs on serving cell for each of
the other intra-frequency layer(s) in the same band.

For each FR2 band, UE is only required to measure neighbour cell CSI-RS
on the CSI-RS layer, whose associated SSB is on the same SSB layer as
the one where UE is required to measure neighbour cell SSB.

#### 9.10.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

Note: The UE is not required to report CSI-RS based L3 measurements when
the timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is larger than one CP. If the UE reports
CSI-RS based L3 measurements when the timing offset exceeds one CP, the
UE is not required to meet the CSI-RS based L3 measurement accuracy
requirements for CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR in TS 38.133 \[2\]
clause 10.1, which apply only when the timing offset is no larger than
one CP.

##### 9.10.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.3, 10.1.7.2, 10.1.8.2, 10.1.12.2 and 10.1.13.2.

##### 9.10.2.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.3, 10.1.7.2, 10.1.8.2, 10.1.12.2 and
10.1.13.2.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.10.2.4.3.

##### 9.10.2.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI- SINR measurements contained in
event triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.3, 10.1.7.2, 10.1.8.2, 10.1.12.2 and 10.1.13.2.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criterion is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than the CSI-RS based measurement defined in
clause 9.10.2.5. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

#### 9.10.2.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameters
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and *associatedSSB*, the CSI-RS based
measurement shall include PSS/SSS detection time of associatedSSB, the
time period used to acquire the SFN information and CSI-RS based
measurement period without gap.

\- PSS/SSS detection time of associatedSSB is the intra-frequency
T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ in clause 9.2.5.1.

\- The time period used to acquire the SFN information is equal to 0 if
the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is synchronous with the
serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled). Otherwise, the time
period used to acquire the SFN information is T~CSI-RS\_SFN\_intra~ as
shown in table 9.10.2.5-3 for FR1. It is assumed that
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is always enabled for FR1 TDD and FR2.

\- If the associatedSSB, which has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.2.5.1,
becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the associatedSSB
becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ±
3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as defined in
clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\], PSS/SSS detection time and time period
used to acquire the SFN information are equal to 0.

The measurement period for CSI- RS based intra-frequency measurements
without gaps is as shown in table 9.10.2.5-1and table 9.10.2.5-2.

Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SS/PBCH
block is configured but not detected by the UE, or if CSI-RS is
configured with associated SSB but not QCL-ed to the associated SSB, the
UE is not required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource.

  NOTE 1: The requirements apply assuming CSI-RS configuration with {D=3 with PRBs ≥ 48}. D is frequency domain density for the 1-port CSI-RS for L3 mobility defined in clause 7.4.1 of TS 38.211 \[6\].   

M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ : For a UE supporting power class 1,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =40. For a UE supporting FR2 power class 2,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 3,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24. For a UE supporting power class 4,
M~meas\_period\_w/o\_gaps~ =24.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5.

For a UE not supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or for a UE is
supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* but not configured with concurrent
measurement gaps, and the UE does not support
\[*musim-GapPreference-r17\]* or is supporting
\[*musim-GapPreference-r17\]* but not configured with periodic MUSIM
gaps,

\- if the intra-frequency CSI-RS resource does not overlap with any
measurement gaps, K~p\_CSI-RS~=1;

\- if some occasions of the intra-frequency CSI-RS resource is
overlapped with any measurement gaps, K~p\_CSI-RS~ = 1/(1- (CSI-RS
resource period /MGRP)) , where CSI-RS resource period \< MGRP, and the
MGRP is the periodicity of the measurement gap.

\- Otherwise, when UE supports concurrent measurement gaps or
\[*musim-GapPreference-r17\]* or both concurrent measurement gaps and
*\[musim-GapPreference-r17\],* and concurrent measurement gaps or
periodic MUSIM gaps or both concurrent gaps and periodic MUSIM gaps are
configured, K~p\_CSI-RS~ is the scaling factor for a CSI-RS frequency
layer to be measured outside gap which is defined as K~p\_CSI-RS~ =
**N~total~ / N~available~**

For a window W of duration max(CSI-RS period~,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP
max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG, periodic MUSIM
gaps, and per-FR MG within the same FR as the CSI-RS frequency layer,
and starting at the beginning of any gap occasions covering the CSI-RS
resources:

N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with other MG and MUSIM gap occasions
within the window, and

N~available~ is the number of CSI-RS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any other non-dropped MG or non-dropped MUSIM gap
occasions within the window W, after accounting for MG and MUSIM gap
collisions by applying the collision rules for the measurement gap and
MUSIM gap in clauses 9.1.8.3, 9.1.10.4 and 9.1.10.5, respectively.

K~p\_CSI-RS~ = 1 when N~available~ = 0

Requirements in this clause do not apply when N~available~ = 0 due to
fully overlapping between CSI-RS occasions and MUSIM gap occasions
within the window W.

When UE supports \[*MUSIM-GapConfig-17\]* and the CSI-RS occasions of
the target frequency layer is overlapping with the configured aperiodic
MUSIM gap, longer cell identification period for the target frequency
layer is expected.

#### 9.10.2.6 Scheduling availability of UE during CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements 

UE is required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when
CSI-RS resources are completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.
Note the configured CSI-RS symbol is indicated in
*firstOFDMSymbolInTimeDomain* included in
*CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility* for RRM. When UE is required to perform
CSI-RS based RRM measurements, and any of the conditions in the
following clauses is met, there are restrictions on the scheduling
availability; otherwise, there is no scheduling restriction. Note same
numerology for intra-frequency CSI-RS and data of serving cell is
considered in this release.

##### 9.10.2.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing CSI-RS based measurements in TDD bands

When UE performs CSI-RS intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band,

\- UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on configured CSI-RS
resource symbols, and on 1 OFDM symbol before and after each
consecutively configured CSI-RS symbols.

When TDD intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured on the
non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Ohterwise, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with the aforementioned restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

##### 9.10.2.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing CSI-RS based measurements in FR2 

When the UE performs CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements for L3
mobility management in FR2, the following restrictions apply.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on the configured CSI-RS symbol within
the configured slot as indicated in *slotConfig of the corresponding
CSI-RS resource to be measured for mobility.*

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions due to a given serving cell also apply to all other serving
cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap
with aforementioned restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to
CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ or CSI-SINR measurement on an FR2 intra-frequency
cell in different bands, provided that UE is capable of independent beam
management on this FR2 band pair.

### 9.10.3 CSI-RS based Inter-frequency measurements

#### 9.10.3.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.10.2.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and the higher layer parameter
*associatedSSB* is configured, the UE shall be able to identify
inter-frequency cells indicated for measurement and perform CSI-RSRP,
CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency cells.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect the
associated SSB nor perform measurement of the CSI-RS resource configured
in *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* on an inter-frequency measurement object
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, and
ends later than the gap end -- switching time. When the inter-frequency
cells are in FR2 and the per-FR gap is configured to the UE in EN-DC, SA
NR, NE-DC and NR-DC, or the serving cells are in FR2, the
inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-UE gap is configured to the
UE in SA NR and NR-DC, the switching time is 0.25 ms. Otherwise the
switching time is 0.5 ms.

If a UE is configured with multiple concurrent gaps, the requirements in
this clause shall apply when the measurement gap pattern is configured
to be associated to the CSI-RS resources of the inter-frequency layer.

#### 9.10.3.2 Requirements applicability

The associated SSB layer of the CSI-RS follows the same requirements as
SSB based measurements defined in clause 9.3.

The requirements in clause 9.10.3 apply, provided:

\- The associated SSB of the cell being identified or measured is
detectable, and

\- All CSI-RS resources on one inter-frequency layer are configured
within a window of up to 5 ms, and

\- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 10 ms, 20 ms or
40 ms, and

\- CSI-RS resources for measurements and the associated SSB for cell
identification are configured within measurement gap.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant associated SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4.1 and
10.1.5.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9.1 and
10.1.10.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14.1 and
10.1.15.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource shall be considered measurable when for each relevant
CSI-RS resource:

\- CSI-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4.3 and
10.1.5.3 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9.2 and
10.1.10.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- CSI \_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.13 for a
corresponding band.

#### 9.10.3.3 Number of cells and number of CSI-RS resources

##### 9.10.3.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 14 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI , and

\- The cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB.

##### 9.10.3.3.2 Requirements for FR2

For each inter-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 24 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI, and

\- The cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer the associated SSB.

#### 9.10.3.4 Measurements reporting requirements

Note: The UE is not required to report CSI-RS based L3 measurements when
the timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is larger than one CP. If the UE reports
CSI-RS based L3 measurements when the timing offset exceeds one CP, the
UE is not required to meet the CSI-RS based L3 measurement accuracy
requirements for CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR in TS 38.133 \[2\]
clause 10.1, which apply only when the timing offset is no larger than
one CP.

##### 9.10.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.2, 10.1.5.2, 10.1.9.2, 10.1.10.2, 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2.

##### 9.10.3.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.2, 10.1.5.2, 10.1.9.2, 10.1.10.2, 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.10.3.4.3.

##### 9.10.3.4.3 Event-triggered Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.2, 10.1.5.2, 10.1.9.2, 10.1.10.2, 10.1.14.2 and
10.1.15.2.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 × TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be within CSI-RS based measurement defined in clause
9.10.3.5. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

#### 9.10.3.5 Inter-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, if configured with the higher layer
parameters *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and *associatedSSB,* the UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable CSI-RS based inter-frequency cell
within T ~CSI-RS\_identify\_inter~,

T ~CSI-RS\_identify\_inter~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync~ + T
~CSI-RS\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~CSI-RS\_SFN\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync~ is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection which is
determined according to T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ in clause 9.3.4,

~TCSI-RS\_SFN\_inter\ is\ the\ time\ period\ used\ to\ acquire\ the\ SFN\ information\ of\ the\ cell\ being\ measured,\ which\ is\ shown\ in\ table\ 9.10.3.5-3\ for\ FR1\ and\ equals\ inter-frequency\ TSSB\_time\_index\_inter\ in\ clause\ 9.3.4\ for\ FR2,~

T~CSI-RS\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of
CSI-RS based measurement given in table 9.10.3.5-1 and table 9.10.3.5-2.

M~meas\_period\_inter~: For a UE supporting FR2 power class 1 or 5,
M~meas\_period\_inter~ =8×N samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power class
2, M~meas\_period\_inter~=5×N samples. For a UE supporting FR2 power
class 3, M~meas\_period\_inter~ =5×N samples. For a UE supporting FR2
power class 4, M~meas\_period\_inter~ = 5×N samples. Note that scaling
factor N = \[8\].

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1.5 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

When UE supports concurrent measurement gaps or
\[*musim-GapPreference-r17\]* or both concurrent measurement gap and
\[*musim-GapPreference-r17\]*, and concurrent measurement gaps or
periodic MUSIM gaps or both concurrent gaps and periodic MUSIM gaps are
configured, K~p\_CSI-RS~ is the scaling factor for a CSI-RS frequency
layer to be measured within the associated measurement gap which is
defined as K~p\_CSI-RS~ = N~total~ / N~available~. K~p\_CSI-RS~ = 1 for
UE not configured with concurrent measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps.

\- For a window W of duration max(CSI-RS period,
MGRP\_max)[,]{.underline} where MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all
configured per-UE MG, periodic MUSIM gaps, and per-FR MG within the same
FR as the CSI-RS frequency layer, and starting at the beginning of any
gap occasions covering the CSI-RS resources.

\- N~total~ is the total number of associated gap occasions covering
CSI-RS resources within the window, **including** those **overlapped**
with other measurement gap and MUSIM gap instances within the window,
and

\- N~available~ is the number of **non-dropped** associated gap
occasions covering CSI-RS resources within the window W, after
accounting for MG and MUSIM gap collisions by applying the collision
rules for the measurement gap and MUSIM gap in clause 9.1.8.3 and
9.1.10.5, respectively.

\- Requirements do not apply if N~available~ = 0

When UE supports \[***musim-GapPreference-r17***\] and if the configured
aperiodic MUSIM gap collides with the measurement gap associated with
the target frequency layer, where MUSIM gap collision rule in clause
9.1.10.4 is applied, longer cell identification period for the target
inter-frequency is expected.

Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SSB is
configured but not detected by the UE, or if CSI-RS configured with
associated SSB but not QCL-ed to the associated SSB, the UE is not
required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource.

9.10D CSI-RS based L3 measurements for ATG
------------------------------------------

### 9.10D.1 Introduction

This clause contains general requirements on the ATG UE regarding CSI-RS
based measurement reporting in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The requirements
are split in intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements
requirements.

The requirements in this clause apply, provided:

\- Only one MO is configured per CSI-RS frequency layer, and

\- all CSI-RS resources in the same MO are configured with the same
csi-rs-MeasurementBW, and

\- *associatedSSB* is configured in *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and
detectable, and

\- all CSI-RS resources in the same MO are configured with the same
periodicity, and

\- the number of CSI-RS resources in any duration that equals to the
length of a slot is no larger than UE capability
*maxNumberCSI-RS-RRM-RS-SINR*.

\- When there are mixed numerologies, the length of a slot is defined
based on the smallest SCS

### 9.10D.2 CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements

#### 9.10D.2.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement
provided that:

\- the SCS of the CSI-RS resource of the neighbour cell configured for
measurement is the same as the SCS of the CSI-RS resource on the serving
cell indicated for measurement, and

\- the CP type of the CSI-RS resource of neighbour cell configured for
measurement is the same as the CP type of the CSI-RS resource of the
serving cell indicated for measurement, and

\- It is applied for SCS = 60KHz

\- the centre frequency of the CSI-RS resource of the neighbour cell
configured for measurement is the same as the centre frequency of the
CSI-RS resource of the serving cell indicated for measurement

The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and perform
CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR measurements of identified
intra-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell.

No measurement gap is needed for intra-frequency CSI-RS resources
measurements.

For intra-frequency CSI-RS based measurements, UE may cause scheduling
restriction as specified in clause 9.10D.2.6.

Note: Extended CP for CSI-RS based measurement is not supported in this
release.

#### 9.10D.2.2 Requirements applicability

The measurement of the associated SSB follows the same requirements as
SSB based measurements defined in clause 9.2D.

The requirements in clause 9.10D.2 apply, provided:

\- Only one intra-frequency CSI-RS layer per serving cell is configured,
and

\- The BW of the CSI-RS on the intra-frequency neighbor cell is within
the active BWP of the UE, and

\- The associated SSB of the CSI-RS resources being identified or
measured are detectable, and the CSI-RS resources configured for CSI-RS
based L3 measurements are measurable, and

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS resources of intra-MO is the same as that of
the CSI-RS resources configured for the serving cell, and

\- All CSI-RS resources on one intra-frequency layer are configured
within up to two separate windows where each window is up to 5 ms, and

\- for the case of single window further provided

\- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 10 ms, 20 ms or
40 ms

\- for the case of two separate windows further provided

\- The two windows are either both fully non-overlapped with MG or both
partially overlapped with MG

\- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 20 ms or 40 ms

\- The starting point of the first window is the slot boundary of the
serving cell, where the corresponding slot contains the configured L3
CSI-RS resource of the serving cell in the servingCellMO with the
smallest offset, and

\- The starting point of the second window if configured is determined
by an offset of half of the CSI-RS periodicity in slots with regards to
the starting point of the first window, and

\- Numerology for intra-frequency CSI-RS and data of serving cell are
the same.

An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant associated SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2.1 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7.1 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12.1 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.2 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource shall be considered measurable when for each relevant
CSI-RS resource:

\- CSI-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.2.3 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.7.2 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.12.2 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- CSI\_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.12 for a
corresponding band.

#### 9.10D.2.3 Number of cells and number of CSI-RS

##### 9.10D.2.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each intra-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 32 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI on the
intra-frequency layer, and

\- the cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB

#### 9.10D.2.4 Measurement Reporting Requirements

Note: The UE is not required to report CSI-RS based L3 measurements when
the timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is larger than one CP. If the UE reports
CSI-RS based L3 measurements when the timing offset exceeds one CP, the
UE may not meet the CSI-RS based L3 measurement accuracy requirements
for CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR in TS 38.133 \[2\] clause 10.1,
which apply only when the timing offset is no larger than one CP.

##### 9.10D.2.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.3, 10.1.7.2, and 10.1.12.2.

##### 9.10D.2.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.3, 10.1.7.2, and 10.1.12.2.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.10D.2.4.3.

##### 9.10D.2.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI- SINR measurements contained in
event triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in
clauses 10.1.2.3, 10.1.7.2, and 10.1.12.2.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long as
no reporting criterion is fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources being available for UE to send the measurement report on.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than the CSI-RS based measurement defined in
clause 9.10D.2.5. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

#### 9.10D.2.5 Intra-frequency measurements without measurement gaps

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameters
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and *associatedSSB*, the CSI-RS based
measurement shall include PSS/SSS detection time of associatedSSB, the
time period used to acquire the SFN information and CSI-RS based
measurement period without gap.

\- PSS/SSS detection time of associatedSSB is the intra-frequency
T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_intra~ in clause 9.2D.5.1.

\- The time period used to acquire the SFN information is equal to 0 if
the UE is indicated that the neighbour cell is synchronous with the
serving cell (*deriveSSB-IndexFromCell* is enabled). Otherwise, the time
period used to acquire the SFN information is T~CSI-RS\_SFN\_intra~ as
shown in table 9.10D.2.5-3 for FR1.

\- If the associatedSSB, which has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.2D.5.1,
becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the associatedSSB
becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ±
3200/$2^{µ}$ T~c~, where *µ* is the SCS configuration as defined in
clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\], PSS/SSS detection time and time period
used to acquire the SFN information are equal to 0.

The measurement period for CSI- RS based intra-frequency measurements
without gaps is as shown in table 9.10D.2.5-1.

Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SS/PBCH
block is configured but not detected by the UE, or if CSI-RS is
configured with associated SSB but not QCL-ed to the associated SSB, the
UE is not required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource.

CSSF~intra~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1D.5.

For a UE not supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or for a UE is
supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* but not configured with concurrent
measurement gaps,

\- if the intra-frequency CSI-RS resource does not overlap with any
measurement gaps, K~p\_CSI-RS~=1;

\- if some occasions of the intra-frequency CSI-RS resource is
overlapped with measurement gaps, K~p\_CSI-RS~ = 1/(1- (CSI-RS resource
period /MGRP)) , where CSI-RS resource period \< MGRP, and the MGRP is
the periodicity of the measurement gap.

\- Otherwise, when UE supports concurrent measurement gaps*,* and
concurrent measurement gaps are configured, K~p\_CSI-RS~ is the scaling
factor for a CSI-RS frequency layer to be measured outside gap which is
defined as K~p\_CSI-RS~ = **N~total~ / N~available~**

For a window W of duration max(CSI-RS period~,~ MGRP\_max), where
MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE MG, and
starting at the beginning of any gap occasions covering the CSI-RS
resources:

N~total~ is the total number of CSI-RS resources within the window,
including those overlapped with other MG occasions within the window,
and

N~available~ is the number of CSI-RS resources that are not overlapped
with any other non-dropped MG occasion within the window W, after
accounting for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision
rule.

K~p\_CSI-RS~ = 1 when N~available~ = 0

For UE supporting *antennaArrayType-r18*,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap are not fully
overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped
by intra-frequency SMTC occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and
*SS-RSSI-Measurement* are configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by
the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement
objects on the same serving carrier which can be merged. and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.

For UE not supporting *antennaArrayType-r18*, K~layer1\_measurement~=1.

#### 9.10D.2.6 Scheduling availability of UE during CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurements 

UE is required to be capable of measuring without measurement gaps when
CSI-RS resources are completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.
Note the configured CSI-RS symbol is indicated in
*firstOFDMSymbolInTimeDomain* included in
*CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility* for RRM. When UE is required to perform
CSI-RS based RRM measurements, and any of the conditions in the
following clauses is met, there are restrictions on the scheduling
availability; otherwise, there is no scheduling restriction. Note same
numerology for intra-frequency CSI-RS and data of serving cell is
considered in this release.

##### 9.10D.2.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing CSI-RS based measurements in TDD bands

When ATG UE performs CSI-RS intra-frequency measurements in a TDD band,

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on configured
CSI-RS resource symbols, and on 1 OFDM symbol before and after each
consecutively configured CSI-RS symbols.

When the ATG UE capable of *antennaArrayType-r18* performs
intra-frequency neighbouring cell measurements in a TDD band,

\- The UE is not expected to receive PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on
configured CSI-RS resource symbols, and on 1 OFDM symbol before and
after each consecutively configured CSI-RS symbols.

### 9.10D.3 CSI-RS based Inter-frequency measurements

#### 9.10D.3.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as a CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.10D.2.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and the higher layer parameter
*associatedSSB* is configured, the UE shall be able to identify
inter-frequency cells indicated for measurement and perform CSI-RSRP,
CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements of identified inter-frequency cells.

When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect the
associated SSB nor perform measurement of the CSI-RS resource configured
in *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* on an inter-frequency measurement object
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, and
ends later than the gap end -- switching time. The switching time is 0.5
ms.

#### 9.10D.3.2 Requirements applicability

The associated SSB layer of the CSI-RS follows the same requirements as
SSB based measurements defined in clause 9.3D.

The requirements in clause 9.10D.3 apply, provided:

\- The associated SSB of the cell being identified or measured is
detectable, and

\- All CSI-RS resources on one inter-frequency layer are configured
within a window of up to 5 ms, and

\- The periodicity of the configured CSI-RS resources is 10 ms, 20 ms or
40 ms, and

\- CSI-RS resources for measurements and the associated SSB for cell
identification are configured within measurement gap.

An inter-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant associated SSB:

\- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4.1 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9.1 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- SS-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14.1 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding
band.

A CSI-RS resource shall be considered measurable when for each relevant
CSI-RS resource:

\- CSI-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.4.3 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-RSRQ related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.9.2 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- CSI-SINR related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.14.2 for FR1,
for a corresponding band,

\- CSI \_RP and CSI-RS Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.13 for a
corresponding band.

#### 9.10D.3.3 Number of cells and number of CSI-RS resources

##### 9.10D.3.3.1 Requirements for FR1

For each inter-frequency CSI-RS layer, during each layer 1 measurement
period, the UE shall be capable of performing CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and
CSI-SINR measurements for at least:

\- 14 CSI-RSs with different CSI-RS index and/or PCI , and

\- The cells to be monitored based on CSI-RS are the same set or a
subset of the cells monitored based on the layer of the associated SSB.

#### 9.10D.3.4 Measurements reporting requirements

NOTE: The UE is not required to report CSI-RS based L3 measurements when
the timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is larger than one CP. If the UE reports
CSI-RS based L3 measurements when the timing offset exceeds one CP, the
UE may not meet the CSI-RS based L3 measurement accuracy requirements
for CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR in TS 38.133 \[2\] clause 10.1,
which apply only when the timing offset is no larger than one CP.

##### 9.10D.3.4.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.3, 10.1.9.2 and 10.1.14.2.

##### 9.10D.3.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.3, 10.1.9.2, and 10.1.14.2.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 9.10D.3.4.3.

##### 9.10D.3.4.3 Event-triggered Reporting

Reported CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ, and CSI-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.4.3, 10.1.9.2 and 10.1.14.2.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 × TTI~DCCH~. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be within CSI-RS based measurement defined in clause.
When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

#### 9.10D.3.5 Inter-frequency measurements with measurement gaps

When measurement gaps are provided, if configured with the higher layer
parameters *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and *associatedSSB,* the UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable CSI-RS based inter-frequency cell
within T ~CSI-RS\_identify\_inter~,

T ~CSI-RS\_identify\_inter~ = (T~PSS/SSS\_sync~ + T
~CSI-RS\_measurement\_period\_inter~ + T~CSI-RS\_SFN\_inter~) ms

Where:

T~PSS/SSS\_sync~ is the time period used in PSS/SSS detection which is
determined according to T~PSS/SSS\_sync\_inter~ in clause 9.3D.4,

T~CSI-RS\_SFN\_inter~ is the time period used to acquire the SFN
information of the cell being measured, which is shown in table
9.10D.3.5-3 for FR1,

T~CSI-RS\_measurement\_period\_inter~: equal to a measurement period of
CSI-RS based measurement given in table 9.10D.3.5-1.

CSSF~inter~: it is a carrier specific scaling factor and is determined
according to CSSF~within\_gap,i~ in clause 9.1D.5 for measurement
conducted within measurement gaps.

If a UE which supports concurrent measurement gaps has been configured
with concurrent measurement gaps, K~p\_CSI-RS~ is the scaling factor for
a CSI-RS frequency layer to be measured within the associated
measurement gap which is defined as K~p\_CSI-RS~ = N~total~ /
N~available~. K~p\_CSI-RS~ = 1 for for UE not configured with concurrent
measurement gaps.

\- For a window W of duration max(CSI-RS period,
MGRP\_max)[,]{.underline} where MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all
configured per-UE MG and per-FR1 MG within the same FR as the CSI-RS
frequency layer, and starting at the beginning of any gap occasions
covering the CSI-RS resources.:

\- N~total~ is the total number of associated gap occasions covering
CSI-RS resources within the window, **including both** dropped and
non-dropped instances of the associated measurement gap within the
window, and

\- N~available~ is the number of **non-dropped** associated gap
occasions covering CSI-RS resources within the window W, after
accounting for MG collisions by applying the selected gap collision
rule.

\- Requirements do not apply if N~available~ = 0

For UE supporting *antennaArrayType-r18*,

K~layer1\_measurement~=1,

\- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap are not fully
overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC occasions, or

\- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped
by intra-frequency SMTC occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB
symbols and the RSSI symbols, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* and
*SS-RSSI-Measurement* are configured, where SSB symbols are indicated by
the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all the configured measurement
objects on the same serving carrier which can be merged. and RSSI
symbols are indicated by *SS-RSSI-Measurement*;

> K~layer1\_measurement~=1.5, otherwise.

For UE not supporting *antennaArrayType-r18*, K~layer1\_measurement~=1.

Additionally, for a given CSI-RS resource, if the associated SSB is
configured but not detected by the UE, or if CSI-RS configured with
associated SSB but not QCL-ed to the associated SSB, the UE is not
required to monitor the corresponding CSI-RS resource.

9.11 NR measurements with autonomous gaps
-----------------------------------------

### 9.11.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are applicable for CGI identification of
an intra frequency and inter-frequency NR target cell.

The requirements in this clause are specified for CGI identification of
an NR target cell and are applicable for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured with SA or NR-DC or NE-DC operation mode, or with EN-DC
operation mode for CGI identification requested by NR PSCell.

The overall CGI reporting delay is defined in clause 9.11.3.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.11.2 CGI identification of an NR cell with autonomous gaps

The UE shall identify and report the CGI of a known NR target cell when
requested by the network for the purpose of reportCGI. Only one cell is
provided to the UE with *cellForWhichToReportCGI* for identifying the
CGI.The UE may make autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and
uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to
clause 5.5.3 of TS 38.331 \[2\]. Note that a UE is not required to use
autonomous gap if *useAutonomousGaps* is set to false. If autonomous
gaps are used for measurement with the purpose of reportCGI, regardless
of whether DRX is used or not, or whether SCell(s) are configured or
not, the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of NR cell within:

T~identify\_CGI~ = (T~MIB~ + T ~SIB1~) ms

Where:

T~MIB~ is the time period used to acquire MIB message. T~MIB~ = 6 \*
T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on FR1 and T~MIB~ = 25 \*
T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on FR2.

T~SIB1~ is the time period used to acquire SIB1 message. T~SIB1~ = 6 \*
T~RMSI-scheduling~ ms.

Where T~SMTC~ is the SMTC periodicity configured for the target cell
measurement, and T~RMSI-scheduling~ is

\- the maximum between the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually
transmitted by the NR target cell and 20 ms when SSB and RMSI CORESET
multiplexing pattern is 1

\- the maximum between the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually
transmitted by the NR target cell and T~SMTC~ when SSB and RMSI CORESET
multiplexing pattern is 2 or 3.

The requirement for identifying the CGI of an NR cell within
T~identify\_CGI~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well as when any
of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

Within the time T~identify\_CGI~, over which the UE identifies the CGI
of an NR cell, the UE shall fulfil interruption requirements specified
in,

\- clause 8.2.1.2.16 for NR serving cells and clause 7.32.2.15 in TS
36.133 \[15\] for E-UTRA serving cells if the UE is configured with
EN-DC operation mode,

\- clause 8.2.2.2.14 if the UE is configured with SA operation mode,

\- clause 8.2.3.2.14 for NR serving cells and clause 7.36.2.14 in TS
36.133 \[15\] for E-UTRA serving cells if the UE is configured with
NE-DC operation mode,

\- clause 8.2.4.2.11 if the UE is configured with NR-DC operation mode.

In the requirement a cell is known if,

\- During the last 5 seconds for FR1 or 3 seconds for FR2 before the
reception of the report CGI command:

\- The UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index for
the target cell and

\- During MIB decoding at least reported SSBs remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2
or 9.3 of TS 38.133, and

\- During SIB1 decoding the SSB used for MIB decoding remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2
or 9.3 of TS 38.133, and

\- During MIB decoding, the SSB for MIB decoding remains detectable with
SNR ≥-3 dB

\- During SIB1 decoding, the PDSCH for SIB1 decoding remains detectable
with SNR ≥-3 dB

### 9.11.3 CGI reporting delay

The CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command that
will trigger a CGI report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than T~identify\_CGI~ defined in
clause 9.11.2 plus RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\], and additional 20 ms margin if target cell is on FR2.

9.11A NR measurements with autonomous gaps for RedCap
-----------------------------------------------------

### 9.11A.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are applicable for CGI identification of
an intra frequency and inter-frequency NR target cell.

The requirements in this clause are specified for CGI identification of
an NR target cell and are applicable for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured with SA operation mode.

The overall CGI reporting delay is defined in clause 9.11A.3.

### 9.11A.2 CGI identification of an NR cell with autonomous gaps 

The UE shall identify and report the CGI of a known NR target cell when
requested by the network for the purpose of reportCGI. Only one cell is
provided to the UE with *cellForWhichToReportCGI* for identifying the
CGI.The UE may make autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and
uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to
clause 5.5.3 of TS 38.331 \[2\]. Note that a UE is not required to use
autonomous gap if *useAutonomousGaps* is set to false. If autonomous
gaps are used for measurement with the purpose of reportCGI, regardless
of whether DRX is used or not, the UE shall be able to identify a new
CGI of NR cell within:

T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~ = (T~MIB\_redcap~ + T ~SIB1\_redcap~) ms

Where:

> For 2 Rx RedCap UE:

T~MIB\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire MIB message.
T~MIB\_redcap~ = 6 \* T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on
FR1 and T~MIB\_redcap~ = 25 \* T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier
frequency on FR2.

T~SIB1\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire SIB1 message.
T~SIB1\_redcap~ = 6 \* T~RMSI-scheduling~ ms.

> For 1 Rx RedCap UE:

T~MIB\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire MIB message.
T~MIB\_redcap~ = 6 \* T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on
FR1.

T~SIB1\_redcap~ is the time period used to acquire SIB1 message.
T~SIB1\_redcap~ = 12 \* T~RMSI-scheduling~ ms.

Where T~SMTC~ is the SMTC periodicity configured for the target cell
measurement, and T~RMSI-scheduling~ is

\- the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually transmitted by the NR
target cell when SSB and RMSI CORESET multiplexing pattern is 1

\- the maximum between the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually
transmitted by the NR target cell and T~SMTC~ when SSB and RMSI CORESET
multiplexing pattern is 2 or 3.

The requirement for identifying the CGI of an NR cell within
T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well as
when any of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

Within the time T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~, over which the UE identifies
the CGI of an NR cell, the UE shall fulfil interruption requirements
specified in,

\- clause 9.11A.4if the UE is configured with SA operation mode.

In the requirement a cell is known if,

\- During the last 5 seconds for FR1 or 3 seconds for FR2 before the
reception of the report CGI command:

\- The UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index for
the target cell and

\- During MIB decoding at least reported SSBs remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses
9.2B or 9.3B of TS 38.133, and

\- During SIB1 decoding the SSB used for MIB decoding remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses
9.2B or 9.3B of TS 38.133, and

\- During MIB decoding, the SSB for MIB decoding remains detectable with
SNR ≥-3 dB

\- During SIB1 decoding, the PDSCH for SIB1 decoding remains detectable
with SNR ≥-3 dB

### 9.11A.3 CGI reporting delay

The CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command that
will trigger a CGI report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than T~identify\_CGI\_redcap~
defined in clause 9.11A.2 plus RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12
in TS 38.331 \[2\], and additional 20 ms margin if target cell is on
FR2.

### 9.11A.4 CGI reporting scheduling restriction

When a RedCap UE is identifying CGI of an NR cell with autonomous gaps,
the UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/TRS/CSI-RS for CQI on PCell for the following slots:

\- with up to K1 interruptions with interrupted slots up to X1 specified
in table 9.11A.4-1 for each interruption during MIB decoding time period
T~MIB\_redcap~ (ms) specified in clause 9.11A.2.

\- with up to L1 interruptions with interrupted slots up to Y1 specified
in table 9.11A.4-1 during SIB1 decoding time period T~SIB1\_redcap~ (ms)
specified in clause 9.11A.2 for SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling
multiplexing patterns 1.

\- with up to L2 interruptions with interrupted slots up to interruption
length Y2 specified in table 9.11A.4-1 during SIB1 decoding time period
T~SIB1\_redcap~ (ms) specified in clause 9.11A.2 for SSB and CORESET for
RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2 and 3.

Where:

\- K1 = 6 for the target cell carrier frequency on FR1 and K1 = 25 for
the target cell carrier frequency on FR2, and

\- L1 = T~SIB1\_redcap~ /20 and

\- L2 = T~SIB1\_redcap~ /T~SMTC~, where T~SMTC~ is the periodicity of
the SMTC occasion configured for the target cell carrier.

9.11D NR measurements with autonomous gaps for ATG
--------------------------------------------------

The requirements in clause 9.11 shall apply only for FR1 without
considering CA/DC and inter-RAT measurement.

### 9.11D.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are applicable for CGI identification of
an intra frequency and inter-frequency NR target cell.

The requirements in this clause are specified for CGI identification of
an NR target cell and are applicable for a UE:

\- in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and

\- configured with SA for CGI identification requested by NR PSCell.

The overall CGI reporting delay is defined in clause 9.11D.3.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.11D.2 CGI identification of an NR cell with autonomous gaps

The UE shall identify and report the CGI of a known NR target cell when
requested by the network for the purpose of reportCGI. Only one cell is
provided to the UE with *cellForWhichToReportCGI* for identifying the
CGI.The UE may make autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and
uplink transmission for receiving MIB and SIB1 message according to
clause 5.5.3 of TS 38.331 \[2\]. Note that a UE is not required to use
autonomous gap if *useAutonomousGaps* is set to false. If autonomous
gaps are used for measurement with the purpose of reportCGI, regardless
of whether DRX is used or not, or whether SCell(s) are configured or
not, the UE shall be able to identify a new CGI of NR cell within:

T~identify\_CGI~ = (T~MIB~ + T ~SIB1~) ms

Where:

T~MIB~ is the time period used to acquire MIB message. T~MIB~ = 6 \*
T~SMTC~ ms for target cell carrier frequency on FR1.

T~SIB1~ is the time period used to acquire SIB1 message. T~SIB1~ = 6 \*
T~RMSI-scheduling~ ms.

Where T~SMTC~ is the SMTC periodicity configured for the target cell
measurement, and T~RMSI-scheduling~ is

\- the maximum between the periodicity with which the SIB1 is actually
transmitted by the NR target cell and 20 ms when SSB and RMSI CORESET
multiplexing pattern is 1.

The requirement for identifying the CGI of an NR cell within
T~identify\_CGI~ is applicable when no DRX is used as well as when any
of the DRX cycles specified in TS 38.331 \[2\] is used.

Within the time T~identify\_CGI~, over which the UE identifies the CGI
of an NR cell, the UE shall fulfil interruption requirements specified
in clause 8.2.2.2.14.

In the requirement a cell is known if,

\- During the last 5 seconds for FR1 before the reception of the report
CGI command:

\- The UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index for
the target cell and

\- During MIB decoding at least reported SSBs remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses
9.2D or 9.3D of TS 38.133, and

\- During SIB1 decoding the SSB used for MIB decoding remains detectable
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses
9.2D or 9.3D of TS 38.133, and

\- During MIB decoding, the SSB for MIB decoding remains detectable with
SNR ≥-3 dB

\- During SIB1 decoding, the PDSCH for SIB1 decoding remains detectable
with SNR ≥-3 dB

### 9.11D.3 CGI reporting delay

The CGI reporting delay is defined as the time between a command that
will trigger a CGI report and the point when the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the air interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
of 2 x TTI~DCCH~ resulting when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes any
delay caused by lack of UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.

The CGI reporting delay shall be less than T~identify\_CGI~ defined in
clause 9.11.2 plus RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

9.12 Measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation
---------------------------------------------------

### 9.12.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are applicable for UE capable of
RTT-based propagation delay compensation based on PRS/TRS and SRS, where
the UE is configured with *measObjectRxTxDiff* in
*MeasObjectToAddModList defined in TS 38.331 \[2\]*.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.12.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.12 apply for periodic triggered UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurements, provided:

\- If UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is based on PRS, the related
side conditions given in clause 10.1.39.2 are met for a corresponding
band.

\- If UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is based on TRS, the related
side conditions given in clause 10.1.39.3 are met for a corresponding
band.

\- SRS is configured on at least one of the PCell.

All measurement requirements specified in clause 9.12.4 shall apply when
no DRX is in use as well as for when DRX is in use (clause 3.6.1) for
any DRX configuration specified in TS 38.331 \[2\].

### 9.12.3 Measurement Capability

If UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is based on PRS, the capability
is as indicated by the UE in *rtt-BasedPDC-PRS-r17 in TS 38.331 \[2\].*

If UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement is based on TRS, the capability
is as indicated by the UE in *rtt-BasedPDC-CSI-RS-ForTracking-r17 in TS
38.331 \[2\]*.

### 9.12.4 Measurement period requirements

#### 9.12.4.1 PRS Measurement Period

When UE is configured with *prs-Ref-r17* in *MeasObjectRxTxDiff*-r17
defined in TS 38.331 \[2\] and provided with PRS resource configuration,
the UE shall be able to measure UE Rx-Tx time difference on PCell within

$T_{UERxTx,\ PRS} = {\left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{PRS}}^{\text{slot}}}{N^{'}} \right\rceil*N_{\text{sample}}*K_{layer3}*{\text{LCM}(T}_{\text{PRS}},\ T_{\text{DRX}})}_{}$

Where:

$N_{\text{PRS}}^{\text{slot}}$ is the maximum number of DL PRS resources
configured in a slot,

in a slot corresponding to *maxNumberPRS-ResourceProcessedPerSlot-r17*
as specified in *TS 38.331 \[2\]*,

$N_{\text{sample}}$ is the number of UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement samples and $N_{\text{sample}}$= 4,

$T_{\text{PRS}}$ is the PRS resource periodicity specific for RTT-based
propagation delay compensation,

$T_{\text{DRX}}$ is the DRX cycle length when DRX is in use, 1 ms
otherwise.

$K_{layer3}$ is

N~total~ / N~available~, when N~available~\>0

Where,

\- For a window W of duration LCM(T~PRS~, MGRP\_max, T~SMTC~) and
starting at the beginning of any PRS resource occasion, where T~SMTC~ is

measurement gaps, otherwise MGRP\_max is the MGRP of configured per-UE
measurement gap or per-FR measurement gap within the same FR as PCell:

\- N~total~ is the total number of PRS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~available~ is the number of PRS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with:

> gap collisions by applying the measurement gap collision rule in
> clause 9.1.8.3 within the window W
>
> \- For FR2: any measurement gap occasions nor any SMTC occasions
> within window W. And for a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* after
> accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the measurement
> gap collision rule in clause 9.1.8.3 nor any SMTC occasions within the
> window W.

No requirements shall apply if N~available~=0.

UE is only required to perform UE Rx-Tx time difference on PRS within
the active DL BWP.

When UE is configured to perform UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement
based on PRS, the requirements apply provided that the SCS of the PRS is
same as that of the active BWP on PCell.

For FR2, the requirements apply if QCL information is provided for all
the PRS resources in the resource set and for each resource one RS has
QCL-TypeD.

If PRS resources overlap with Type 1A/1B/2 PPW, the UE is allowed longer
measurement period to measure UE Rx-Tx time difference on PCell.

#### 9.12.4.2 TRS Measurement Period

When UE is configured with *csi-RS-Ref-r17* in *MeasObjectRxTxDiff*-r17
defined in TS 38.331 \[2\] and provided with TRS resource configuration,
the UE shall be able to measure UE Rx-Tx time difference on PCell within
the measurement period T~UERx-Tx\_TRS~, where:

$T_{UERxTx,TRS} = N_{\text{sample}}\ *K_{layer3}*{LCM(T}_{\text{TRS}},\ T_{\text{DRX}})$

Where

$N_{\text{sample}}$ is the number of UE Rx-Tx time difference

MGRP\_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement
gaps and per-FR measurement gaps within the same FR as PCell for a UE
that support *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and is configured with concurrent
measurement gaps, otherwise MGRP\_max is the MGRP of configured per-UE
measurement gap or per-FR measurement gap within the same FR as PCell:

\- N~total~ is the total number of TRS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~available~ is the number of TRS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with

> \- For FR1: any **measurement gap** occasions within window W. And for

> accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the measurement
> gap collision rule in clause 9.1.8.3 nor any SMTC occasions within the
> window W.

No requirements shall apply if N~available~=0.

UE is only required to perform UE Rx-Tx time difference on TRS within
the active DL BWP. When UE is configured to perform UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement based on TRS, the requirements apply provided
that the SCS of the TRS is same as that of the active BWP on PCell.

For FR2, the requirements apply if QCL information is provided for all
the TRS resources in the resource set and for each resource one RS has
QCL-TypeD.

If TRS resources overlap with Type 1A/1B/2 PPW, the UE is allowed longer
measurement period to measure UE Rx-Tx time difference on PCell.

### 9.12.5 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall report UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement results if UE
supports *gNB-SideRTT-BasedPDC-r17*.

The measurement reporting delay excludes the delay uncertainty caused by
inserting the measurement report into the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The
delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI~DCCH~ where TTI~DCCH~ is the duration of
subframe or slot or subslot when the measurement report is transmitted
on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or subslot duration. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by no UL resources for UE to
send the measurement report.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement values contained in measurement
report shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements
specified in clause 10.1.25.3, with k = 5.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy shall be fulfilled
according to the accuracy requirements specified in clause 10.1.39.2 and
10.1.39.3 for PRS and TRS, respectively.

### 9.12.6 Scheduling availability during measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation

During measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation in an FR2 cell,

\- For the case where the PRS or TRS for PDC measurement is QCLed with
active TCI state for PDCCH/PDSCH, there are no scheduling restrictions
due to PDC measurement performed based on PRS or TRS.

\- Otherwise, the UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or
receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols
corresponding to the PRS or TRS resource configured for PDC measurement.

### 9.12.7 Measurement restriction for measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation

During measurement for Propagation Delay Compensation in an FR2 cell,
when the PRS or TRS for PDC measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB or CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both PRS or TRS for PDC measurement and the other RS if they
are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL information is not known to
UE. Longer measurement period for PRS or TRS for PDC measurement is
expected.

### 9.12.8 Measurement requirement for Propagation Delay Compensation with MUSIM gaps

The measurement requirement defined for measurement for Propagation
Delay Compensation in this clause 9.12 applies, if there is no overlap
between MUSIM gaps and PRS or TRS for propagation delay compensation
measurements.

9.13 L1-RSRP measurements for a cell with different PCI from serving cell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.13.1 Introduction

When configured by the network, the UE shall be able to perform L1-RSRP
measurements of configured measurement resources from a cell with
different PCI in addition to serving cell (PCI indicated in
*additionalPCI-r17*), with the measurement resources configured as SSBs
of the cell with different PCI.

The UE shall be able to measure all SSB resources of the cell with
different PCI in *csi-SSB-ResourceSet* within the CSI-Resource*Config*
settings for the active BWP, while the *additionalPCI-r17 of the SSB
resources are different from serving cell PCI.* The number of resources,
including the number of resources configured for serving cell L1-RSRP
measurement in clause 9.5, does not exceed the UE capability indicated
by *beamManagementSSB-CSI-RS*.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the higher
layer parameter *reportConfigType* of each reporting setting
*CSI-ReportConfig* for the active BWP.

The measurement reporting delay can be longer for the measurement
reporting requirements in this clause when IDC autonomous denial is
configured.

### 9.13.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in the clause 9.13 are applicable to inter-cell beam
management and inter-cell multi-TRP scenarios.

The requirements in clause 9.13 apply, provided the SSB from cell with
PCI different from serving cell configured for L1-RSRP if the following
conditions are met:

\- the number of cells with PCI different from seving cells N~max~ = 1
for FR2 and N~max~ = maxNrofAdditionalPCI for FR1. Where,
maxNrofAdditionalPCI is defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

\- The SSB from the cell with different PCI completely contained in the
active BWP or associated with initial downlink BWP of the UE

\- The SSB of the cell with different PCI from serving cell has the same
SCS, SFN offset and center frequency as the SSB of the serving cell

\- For a UE that supports both *multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*, the
requirements apply when RX timing difference is up to MRTD as specified
in clause 7.6.8.

\- For a UE which does not support *rxTimingDiff-r18*, the requirements
apply when RX timing difference is less than CP

\- The cell with different PCI from serving cell is known

\- The SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements are measurable

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP for cell with different PCI from
serving cell shall be considered measurable when for each relevant SSB
the following conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19.1 and
10.1.20.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

The cell with different PCI from serving cell is considered as known if
the following conditions are met in this requirement:

\- The UE has sent a valid L3 measurement report during the last 5
seconds, and

\- The SSB from the cell with different PCI remains detectable according
to the cell identification requirements specified in clause 9.2.

Otherwise, the cell is unknown.

In case the SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements outside
SMTCs are overlapped with PDSCH/PDCCH that is associated to serving
cell, L1-RSRP measurement performance degradation is expected.

### 9.13.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports only for report configurations
configured for the active BWP.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
\[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step size according to clauses 10.1.19 for
FR1 and 10.1.20 for FR2 if *nrofReportedRS* is configured to one. If
*nrofReportedRS* is configured to be larger than one, or if
*groupBasedBeamReporting-r17* is enabled, the UE shall use differential
L1-RSRP based reporting as defined in clauses 10.1.19 for FR1 and
10.1.20 for FR2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value
with 2dB step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and
the measured quantity is described in clause 10.1.6.

In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

#### 9.13.3.1 Periodic Reporting

### 9.13.4 L1-RSRP measurement requirements

#### 9.13.4.1 Inter-cell SSB based L1-RSRP Reporting

If a cell with PCI different from serving cell is known according to
clause 9.13.2, the UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP
measurements based on the configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP
computation, and the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
L1-RSRP measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CDP~. The requirements specified in
this clause are only applicable when

\- *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is not configured, and

\- *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured, and

\- *highSpeedMeasCA-Scell-r17* is not configured, and

\- *SSBs of CDP outside SMTCs for L1-RSRP measurement* are not
overlapped with concurrent gaps.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CDP~ is defined in
table 9.13.4.1-1 for FR1, The value of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CDP~ is defined in table 9.13.4.1-2
for FR2 when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured, where

\- M=1 if higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurement*
is configured, and M=3 otherwise

\- N= 8.

When UE supports *musim-GapPreference-r17*, and periodic MUSIM gaps are
configured,

\- an SSB or an SMTC occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a
gap occasion if the gap occasion is dropped according to 9.1.10,

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P = P~L1\_sharing\ factor~ \* P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ /
N~outside\_MG~ in FR2, if N~available~ = 0

\- P is defined as below based on P~2~, where P~2~ = N~total~ /
N~available~ in FR2, if N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, MUSIM
gap(s) and/or per-FR measurement gaps within the same FR as serving
cell, and starting at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions,
MUSIM gap occasions or SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any non-dropped **measurement gap** occasion nor
non-dropped MUSIM gap occasion within the window W, and

\- N~available~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any non-dropped **measurement gap** occasion,
non-dropped MUSIM gap occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W.

**-** an SSB or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped with the
MUSIM gap if it overlaps a MUSIM gap occasion.

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

Otherwise, when UE does not support *musim-GapPreference-r17* or when no
MUSIM gaps are configured,

For FR1,

\- P=$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{\text{MRGP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

> \- P is P~L1\_sharing~\*P~sharing\ factor,\ CDP~, when SSB is not
> overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is fully overlapped with SMTC

\-
P~2~=$\ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{\text{MGRP}} - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap and SSB is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB\_CDP~ \< T~SMTCperiod~)
and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ ≠ MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB\_CDP~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P~2~
is$\frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when SSB is partially overlapped with GAP and SSB is partially
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB\_CDP~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC
occasion is not overlapped with GAP and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and
T~SSB\_CDP~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- P~2~=
$\frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{{min(T}_{\text{SMTCperiod}},MGRP)}}$,when
SSB is partially overlapped with measurement gap (T~SSB\_CDP~ \<MGRP)
and SSB is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB\_CDP~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap.

\- If SSB resource from serving cell is configured for L1-RSRP
measurements, and P~1~ is valid accoding to 9.5.4.1, and any symbol of
the SSBs from serving cell and cell with different PCI are overlapping
or adjacent (in time domain)

\- P =
$\frac{P_{2}}{1 - \frac{P_{2}*T_{SSB\_ CDP}}{{P_{1}*T}_{SSB\_ SC}}}$ ,
if P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~ \< P~1~\*T~SSB\_SC~.

\- P = P~2~, if P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~\> P~1~\*T~SSB\_SC~.

\- P = 2\*P~2~, if P~1~\*T~SSB\_SC~ = P~2~\*T~SSB\_CDP~.

\- Otherwise, P = P~2~

\- T~SSB\_CDP~ = SSB periodicity of the cell with PCI different from
serving cell

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = the configured SMTC period

\- T~SSB\_SC~ = ssb-periodicityServingCell of the serving cell

P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

P~L1\_sharing~ = 2, if SSB resource from serving cell is configured for
L1-RSRP measurements, and P~sharing\_factor~ is used in clause 9.5.4.1,
and any symbol of the SSBs from serving cell and cell with different PCI
are overlapping or adjacent (in time domain). P~L1\_sharing~ = 1,
otherwise.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell with PCI different from serving cell,
longer evaluation period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an NR CGI.

When UE is configured with aperiodic MUSIM gap and the aperiodic MUSIM
gap is overlapping with SSB resource occasion for inter-cell L1-RSRP,
longer evaluation period would be expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and SSB resource occasions for
inter-cell L1-RSRP are fully overlapped with MUSIM gap(s) or fully
overlapped with the union of MUSIM gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement
applies for the SSB based inter-cell L1-RSRP measurement.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell with PCI different from serving cell,
longer L1 RSRP measurement period would be expected during the period
T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

### 9.13.5 Measurement restriction for L1-RSRP measurement

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for L1-RSRP without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

Unless explicitly stated, the SSB to be measured for L1-RSRP measurement
is transmitted from cell(s) with PCI different from serving cell(s).

#### 9.13.5.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1,

If UE does not support \[*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*\],

> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as SSB

>
> \- UE shall be able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without

If UE supports \[*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*\],

when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and SSB transmitted from serving
cell(s) for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement are overlapping or
partially overlapping in OFDM symbols,

> \- UE shall be able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without

when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and CSI-RS transmitted from serving
cell(s) for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement are overlapping or
partially overlapping in OFDM symbols,

for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

> symbol as SSB transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD, or CBD
> measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

### 9.13.6 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions described in the following clauses
apply when UE is performing L1-RSRP measurement on cell(s) with PCI
different from serving cell, and UE is receiving PDCCH/PDSCH from
serving cell and/or cell(s) with different PCI.

#### 9.13.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement with the same SCS as
PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.13.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

If UE does not support \[*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*\],

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
> PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols
> corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

If UE supports \[*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*\],

\- For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols which are
overlapped or partially overlapped with SSB symbols configured for
L1-RSRP measurement

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions apply to cell(s) in the same band on the symbols that fully
or partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) to be measured and
configured on the non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions apply to cell(s) in the same band on the symbols
that fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are
no scheduling restrictions on FR1 cells configured in other bands than
the bands in which the cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed is
configured.

#### 9.13.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
> PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on symbols
> corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions is performed apply to cell(s) in the band on the symbols
that fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 cells in the bands due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s) in different band(s), provided that
UE is capable of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.
Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is configured
with different numerology between SSB on one FR2 band and data on the
other FR2 band provided the UE is configured for IBM operation for the
band pair.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

#### 9.13.6.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR1 cell(s).

#### 9.13.6.5 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs L1-RSRP measurement on cell with different PCI from
serving cell in a TDD band, the following restrictions apply due to
L1-RSRP measurement

If UE does not support \[*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*\],

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on symbols
corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement,
where the transmission of PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS may be on serving cell(s) and
cell(s) with PCI different from serving cell(s), and restricted symbols
may partially or fully overlap with UL symbols

If UE supports \[*multiDCI-InterCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* or
*multiDCI-IntraCellMultiTRP-TwoTA-r18* and *rxTimingDiff-r18*\],

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on the symbols
configured for L1-RSRP measurement which are overlapped or partially
overlapped with SSB symbols configured for L1-RSRP measurement

9.14 NR intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurements for neighbor cell
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.14.1 Introduction

A measurement is defined as an SSB based intra-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell
and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour cell are the same,
and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also the same.

When configured with *LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig-r18* by the network, the UE
shall be able to perform L1-RSRP measurements of configured measurement
resources from a neighbor cell, with the measurement resources
configured as SSBs of the neighbor cell.

If the number of resources/cells, including the number of
resources/cells configured for L1-RSRP measurement in clause 9.14
exceeds the UE capability specified in clause 9.14.4, it is up to UE
implementation on how to choose cells/SSB to measure, and the cells
which have TCI state(s) in the LTM candidate cell active TCI state list
shall be prioritized.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity and send periodic,
semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the higher layer
parameter *reportConfigType-r18* of each reporting setting
*LTM-CSI-ReportConfig-r18*.

### 9.14.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in the clause 9.14 are applicable to FR1 and FR2-1 for
LTM.

The requirements in clause 9.14 apply, provided for the SSB from the
neighbor cell configured for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement, the
following conditions are met:

\- The cell is known

\- The SSB configured for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement is on the
same carrier frequency of SSB configured for L3 intra-frequency
measurement.

\- The SSB resources configured for L1-RSRP measurements are measurable.

An SSB resource configured for L1-RSRP for neighbor cell shall be
considered measurable when for each relevant SSB the following
conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.19D for FR1 and
10.1.20A for FR2-1, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

The cell is considered as known if the following conditions are met in
this requirement:

\- The UE has performed L3 measurement on the target cell during the
last 5 seconds, and

\- The SSB from the target cell configured for L1 measurement remains
detectable according to the cell identification requirements specified
in clause 9.2.

Otherwise, the cell is unknown.

### 9.14.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
-140, -44 dBm with 1 dB step size according to clauses 10.1.19D for FR1
and 10.1.20A for FR2 if *noOfReportedRS-PerCell-r18* and
*noOfReportedCells-r18* are both configured to one. If
*noOfReportedRS-PerCell-r18* and/or *noOfReportedCells-r18* are
configured to be larger than one, the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP
based reporting as defined in clause 10.1.19D for FR1 and 10.1.20A for
FR2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2 dB
step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in clause 10.1.6, where the reported
differential value for unmeasured LTM L1-RSRP resources is DIFFRSRP\_15
in table 10.1.6.1.

#### 9.14.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19D for FR1 and
10.1.20A for FR2, respectively. The UE shall transmit the periodic
L1-RSRP reporting on PUCCH over the air interface according to the
periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.14.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in a semi-Persistent L1-RSRP
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19D for
FR1 and 10.1.20A for FR2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.14.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19D for FR1
and 10.1.20A for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement report if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.14.4 Number of SSB frequency layers, number of cells and number of SSBs

The number of intra-frequency layers, number of cells and number of SSBs
that UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements on are
reported by the capabilities
*supportedMaxIntraInterFreqLayersWithoutGaps-r18,
supportedMaxNeighCellsPerFreqLayersWithoutGaps-r18,
supportedMaxSSB-PerFreqLayersWithoutGaps-r18,
supportedMaxCellsWithoutGapsL1-Meas-r18, supportedMaxSSB-L1-Meas-r18,
and supportedMaxSSB-WithinSlotL1-Meas-r18*.

For L1-RSRP measurement on neighbour cell, UE measures only one
intra-frequency layer on each FR2 band in CA scenario, where this single
intra-frequency layer shall be the same frequency layer that UE performs
L3 intra-frequency layer measurement in that FR2 band.

### 9.14.5 L1-RSRP intra-frequency measurement requirements without measurement gaps

#### 9.14.5.1 Intra-frequency SSB based L1-RSRP reporting

The requirements specified in this clause are only applicable when

\- *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* is not configured, and

\- *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured, and

\- *highSpeedMeasCA-Scell-r17* is not configured.

\- The SSB from the neighbor cell is completely contained in the active
BWP of the UE

If a neighbor cell is known according to clause 9.14.2, the UE shall be
capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the configured SSB
resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical layer shall be
capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_intra~ if *deriveSSB-IndexFromCell*
is enabled or UE has reported SSB index in L3 measurement report of the
same cell. Otherwise, UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
L1-RSRP measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_intra~+T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~,
where T~SSB\_time\_index\_intra~ is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.2.5.1-3.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_intra~ is defined for
FR1 in table 9.14.5.1-1 for UE incapable of
*multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18* and in table 9.14.5.1-2 for UE
capable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*. The value of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_intra~ is defined for FR2 in table
9.14.5.1-3 for UE incapable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*
and in table 9.14.5.1-4 for UE capable of
*multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*, where

\- M=1.

\- N= 8.

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~ \> 0

> For a window W of duration max (T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is
> the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps and
> per-FR measurement gaps within the same FR as serving cell, and
> starting at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion
within the window W

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- P~L1\_sharing~ is defined as

\- When number of neighboring cells configured with SSB based L1-RSRP
measurement is 1

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 2, if any symbol of the SSBs from serving cell and
neighbor cell are overlapping or adjacent (in time domain)

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 1, otherwise

\- When number of neighboring cells configured with SSB based L1-RSRP
measurement is more than 1

\- When none of TCI state(s) of the intra-frequency neighbor cells or
inter-frequency neighbor cells without gap are in the LTM candidate cell
active TCI state list

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 3\*N~Neighbor\_Cell~, where N~Neighbor\_Cell~ is the
number of neighbor cells to measure on intra-frequency and
inter-frequency without gap

\- Otherwise

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 3\*N~Neighbor\_Cell\_in\_list~, where
N~Neighbor\_Cell\_in\_list~ is the number of neigbour cells including
intra-frequency neighbor cell(s) and inter-frequency neighbor cell(s)
without gap which have TCI state(s) in the LTM candidate cell active TCI
state list. No requirements are defined for the cell(s) which do not
have TCI state(s) in the LTM candidate cell active TCI state list.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among
all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2
have the same offset.

Longer measurement period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell, longer measurement period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period would
be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

### 9.14.6 Measurement restriction for L1-RSRP measurement

Measurement restrictions described in the following clauses apply when
UE is performing L1-RSRP measurement on neighbor cell(s) without
measurement gap.

Unless explicitly stated, the SSB to be measured for L1-RSRP measurement
is transmitted from neighbor cell(s).

#### 9.14.6.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1,

when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement fully or partially overlaps with
the OFDM symbol as SSB transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD,
CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- UE shall be able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without
any restriction;

when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;

\- \[If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement
and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP measurement
is expected, and no requirements are defined\].

For FR2, for UE incapable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*
and for UE capable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC fully or partially
> overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB transmitted from serving cell(s)
> for RLM, BFD, or CBD measurement on the same CC or different CCs in
> the same band, UE is required to measure one of but not both SSBs.
> Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP is expected, and no
> requirements are defined.
>
> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC fully or partially
> overlaps with the OFDM symbol as CSI-RS transmitted from serving

> CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but not both
> SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
> SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are
> defined.

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

### 9.14.7 Scheduling availability of UE during L1-RSRP measurement

Scheduling availability restrictions described in the following clauses
apply when UE is performing L1-RSRP measurement on neighbor cell(s)
without measurement gap.

Unless explicitly stated, the SSB to be measured for L1-RSRP measurement
is transmitted from neigbor cell(s).

#### 9.14.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement with the same SCS as
PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

#### 9.14.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the concerned OFDM
symbols, where the concerned OFDM symbols are

corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement, if
UE supports *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

\- the same OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, if UE does not support
*multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions apply to cell(s) in the same band on the symbols that fully
or partially overlap with restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier
aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 cells configured in other bands than the bands in
which the cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed.

#### 9.14.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the concerned OFDM

\- the same and 1 OFDM symbol before or after the OFDM symbols
corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement, if
UE supports *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

\- the same OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, if UE does not support
*multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions apply to cell(s) in the band on the symbols that fully or
partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 cells in the bands due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s) in different band(s), provided that
UE is capable of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.
Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is configured
with different numerology between SSB on one FR2 band and data on the
other FR2 band provided the UE is configured for IBM operation for the
band pair.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

#### 9.14.7.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR1 cell(s).

#### 9.14.7.5 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs L1-RSRP measurement on neighbor cell in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on the concerned
OFDM symbols and restricted symbols may partially or fully overlap with
UL symbols, where the concerned OFDM symbols are

\- the same and 1 OFDM symbol before or after the OFDM symbols
corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement, if
UE supports *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

\- the same OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, if UE does not support
*multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*.

9.15 NR inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurements for neighbor cell
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.15.1 Introduction

A L1-RSRP measurement is defined as an inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement provided it is not defined as an intra- frequency L1-RSRP
measurement according to clause 9.14.

For UE supporting *ltm-InterFreqMeasGap-r18*, when measurement gaps are
configured, the UE shall be able to perform inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurements of SSBs from inter-frequency neighbor cells. For UE
supporting *interFreqSSB-L1-MeasWithoutGaps-r18*, the UE shall perform
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurements of SSBs from inter-frequency
neighbor cells without gaps if SSBs are within active BWPs.

The UE shall measure SSB resources within the
*LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig-r18* settings configured for L1-RSRP measurement
on inter-frequency neighbor cells with measurement gaps according to UE
capability specified in clause 9.15.4*. If* the number of resources
configured exceeds the UE capability specified in clause 9.15.4*,* it is
up to UE implementation on how to choose resources to measure, and the
cell(s) which have TCI state(s) in the LTM candidate cell active TCI
state list shall be prioritized.

The UE shall report the measurement quantity (*reportQuantity*) and send
periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic reports, according to the higher
layer parameter *reportConfigType-r18*of each reporting setting
*LTM-CSI-ReportConfig-r18*.

For UE supporting *interFreqL1-OnlyInBC-r18,* for each BC in which the
UE indicates in *interFreqL1-MeasConfig-r18* capability, the UE is only
required to measure and report L1-RSRP SSB measurements configured for
the indicated BC.

### 9.15.2 Requirements Applicability

The requirements in clause 9.15 apply if the following conditions are
met:

\- The SSB configured for inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement is on the
same carrier frequency of SSB configured for RRM measurement in one of
the measurement objects configured in the measObjectNR.

\- The inter-frequency neighbor cell is known.

\- The SSB resources configured for inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurements
are measurable.

An SSB resource configured for inter-frequency L1-RSRP shall be
considered measurable when for each relevant SSB the following
conditions are met:

\- L1-RSRP related side conditions given in clauses 10.1.19E.1 and
10.1.20B.1 for FR1 and FR2, respectively, for a corresponding band,

\- SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding
band.

The inter-frequency neighbor cell is considered as known if the
following conditions are met in this requirement:

\- The UE has performed L3 measurement on the target cell during the
last 5 seconds, and

\- The SSB from the target cell configured for L1 measurement remains
detectable according to the cell identification requirements specified
in clause 9.3.

Otherwise, the cell is unknown.

### 9.15.3 Measurement Reporting Requirements

The UE shall send L1-RSRP reports for report configurations configured
for the inter-frequency L1 measurement on neighbor cell.

The UE shall report the L1-RSRP value as a 7-bit value in the range
-140, -44 dBm with 1dB step size according to clause 10.1.19E for FR1
and 10.1.20B for FR2 if *noOfReportedRS-PerCell-r18* and
*noOfReportedCells-r18* are both configured to one. If
*noOfReportedRS-PerCell-r18* and/or *noOfReportedCells-r18* is
configured to be larger than one, the UE shall use differential L1-RSRP
based reporting as defined in clause 10.1.19E for FR1 and 10.1.20B for
FR2. The differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit value with 2dB
step size. The mapping between the reported L1-RSRP value and the
measured quantity is described in clause 10.1.6, where the reported
differential value for unmeasured LTM L1-RSRP resources is DIFFRSRP\_15
in table 10.1.6.1.

In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to perform
E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be expected
in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional delay can be
expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap.

#### 9.15.3.1 Periodic Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in periodic L1-RSRP measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19E for FR1 and
10.1.20B for FR2, respectively.

The UE shall transmit the periodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUCCH over the
air interface according to the periodicity defined in clause 5.2.1.4 in
TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.15.3.2 Semi-Persistent Reporting

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in a semi-Persistent L1-RSRP
measurement report shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19E for
FR1 and 10.1.20B for FR2, respectively. This requirement applies for
semi-persistent L1-RSRP reports send on PUSCH or PUCCH.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUSCH, if a DCI request has been received.

The UE shall only send semi-persistent L1-RSRP measurement reports on
PUCCH, if an activation command \[7\] has been received.

The UE shall transmit the semi-persistent L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH or
PUCCH over the air interface according to the periodicity defined in
clause 5.2.1.4 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

#### 9.15.3.3 Aperiodic Reporting 

Reported L1-RSRP measurements contained in aperiodic triggered,
aperiodic triggered periodic and aperiodic triggered semi-persistent
L1-RSRP reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.19E for FR1
and 10.1.20B for FR2-1, respectively.

The UE shall only send aperiodic L1-RSRP measurement report if a DCI
trigger has been received.

After the UE receives CSI request in DCI, the UE shall transmit the
aperiodic L1-RSRP reporting on PUSCH over the air interface at the time
specified according to clause 6.1.2.1 in TS 38.214 \[26\].

### 9.15.4 Number of SSB frequency layers, number of cells and number of SSBs

The number of inter-frequency layers, number of cells and number of SSBs
that UE shall be capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements on are
reported in *maxFreqLayersL1-Meas-r18,
maxNeighCellsPerFreqLayerL1-Meas-r18, maxSSB-PerFreqLayerL1-Meas-r18,
supportedMaxCellsWithoutGapsL1-Meas-r18, supportedMaxSSB-L1-Meas-r18,*
and *supportedMaxSSB-WithinSlotL1-Meas-r18*.

### 9.15.5 L1-RSRP inter-frequency measurement requirements with measurement gaps

### 9.15.6 L1-RSRP inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement requirements without measurement gaps

#### 9.15.6.1 Inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement requirements 

##### 9.15.6.1.1 Inter-frequency SSB based L1-RSRP measurement

When configured by the network and the inter-frequency cell's SSB is
completely contained in the DL active BWP, the UE shall be able to
perform L1-RSRP measurements without gaps and without interruptions
based on the configured SSB resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_inter\_withoutGap~.

If a neighbor cell is known according to clause 9.15.2, the UE shall be
capable of performing L1-RSRP measurements based on the configured SSB
resource for L1-RSRP computation, and the UE physical layer shall be
capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_inter\_withoutGap~ if
*deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter-r17* is enabled or UE has reported SSB
index in L3 measurement report of the same cell. Otherwise, UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting L1-RSRP measured over the
measurement period of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_inter\_withoutGap~+T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~,
where T~SSB\_time\_index\_inter~ is the time period used to acquire the
index of the SSB being measured given in table 9.3.9.1-3 for FR1 and in
table 9.3.9.1-4 for FR2.

The value of T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_inter\_withoutGap~ is
defined for FR1 in table 9.15.6.1.1-1. The value of
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_inter\_withoutGap~ is defined for
FR2 in table 9.15.6.1.1-2, where

\- M=1

\- N= 8.

\- P value for SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~ \> 0

> For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is
> the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps and
> per-FR measurement gaps within the same FR as serving cell, and
> starting at the beginning of any SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of SSB resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is the number of SSB resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion
within the window W

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** SSB**.**

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the SSB configured for L1-RSRP measurement
outside measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure* from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- P~L1\_sharing~ is defined as

\- When number of neighboring cells to be measured is 1

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 2, if any symbol of the SSBs from serving cell and
neighbor cell are overlapping or adjacent (in time domain)

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 1, otherwise

\- When number of neighboring cells to be measured is more than 1

\- When none of the TCI state(s) of the intra-frequency neighbor cells
or inter-frequency neighbor cells without gap are in the LTM candidate
cell active TCI state list

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 3\*N~Neighbor\_Cell~, where N~Neighbor\_Cell~ is the
number of neighbor cells to measure on intra-frequency and
inter-frequency without gap

\- Otherwise

\- P~L1\_sharing~ = 3\*N~Neighbor\_Cell\_in\_list~, where
N~Neighbor\_Cell\_in\_list~ is the number of neigbour cells (including
intra-frequency neighbour cell(s) and inter-frequency neighbor cell(s)
without gap) which have TCI state(s) in the LTM candidate cell active
TCI state list. No requirements are defined for the neighbor cell(s)
which do not have TCI state(s) in the LTM candidate cell active TCI
state list.

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signaling of *smtc2* is configured,
for cells indicated in the *pci-List* parameter in *smtc2*,
T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
*smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter *smtc1*.

Longer measurement period would be expected if the combination of SSB,
SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell, longer measurement period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 cell, longer L1 RSRP measurement period would
be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 9.15.6.2 Measurement restriction for inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement

Measurement restrictions described in the following clauses apply when
UE is performing L1-RSRP measurement on neighbor cell(s) without
measurement gap.

Unless explicitly stated, the SSB to be measured for L1-RSRP measurement
is transmitted from neigbor cell(s).

##### 9.15.6.2.1 Measurement restriction for SSB based L1-RSRP

For FR1,

when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement fully or partially overlaps with
the OFDM symbol as SSB transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD,
CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- UE shall be able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without
any restriction;

when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement fully or partially overlaps with
the OFDM symbol of CSI-RS transmitted from serving cell(s) for RLM, BFD,
CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the
> SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any restriction;
>
> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,
>
> \- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
> able to measure the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement without any
> restriction;
>
> \- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
> is required to measure one of but not both SSB for L1-RSRP measurement
> and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP
> measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, for UE incapable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-*r18
and for UE capable of *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18*,

> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC fully or partially
> overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB transmitted from serving cell(s)
> for RLM, BFD, or CBD measurement on the same CC or different CCs in
> the same band, UE is required to measure one of but not both SSBs.
> Longer measurement period for SSB based L1-RSRP is expected, and no
> requirements are defined.
>
> when the SSB for L1-RSRP measurement on one CC fully or partially
> overlaps with the OFDM symbol as CSI-RS transmitted from serving
> cell(s) for RLM, BFD, or CBD measurement on the same CC or different
> CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but not both
> SSB for L1-RSRP measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
> SSB based L1-RSRP measurement is expected, and no requirements are
> defined.

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for L1-RSRP measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

#### 9.15.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE during inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurements

Scheduling availability restrictions described in the following clauses
apply when UE is performing L1-RSRP measurement on inter-frequency
cell(s), and UE is receiving PDCCH/PDSCH from serving cell.

Unless explicitly stated, the SSB to be measured for L1-RSRP measurement
is transmitted from neighbor cell(s).

##### 9.15.6.3.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement with the same SCS as
PDSCH/PDCCH in FR1.

##### 9.15.6.3.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as RS for L1-RSRP measurement. For UEs which do
not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following
restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB configured
for L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the concerned OFDM
symbols, where the concerned OFDM symbols are

\- the same OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and

\- If UE supports *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18* capability, 1
OFDM symbol before or after the OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB
indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions apply to cell(s) in the same band on the symbols that fully
or partially overlap with restricted symbols. When inter-band carrier
aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 cells configured in other bands than the bands in
which the cell where L1-RSRP measurement is performed is configured.

##### 9.15.6.3.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to L1-RSRP measurement.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive
PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS for tracking/CSI-RS for CQI on the concerned OFDM
symbols, where the concerned OFDM symbols are:

\- the same OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and

\- if UE supports *multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18* capability, 1
OFDM symbol before or after the OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB
indexes configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions is performed apply to cell(s) in the band on the symbols
that fully or partially overlap with restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 cells in the bands due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s) in different band(s), provided that
UE is capable of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.
Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is configured
with different numerology between SSB on one FR2 band and data on the
other FR2 band provided the UE is configured for IBM operation for the
band pair.

If following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type
2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for L1-RSRP
measurement.

##### 9.15.6.3.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR2 cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 cell(s) due to L1-RSRP
measurement performed on FR1 cell(s).

##### 9.15.6.3.5 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement in TDD bands on FR1

When UE performs L1-RSRP measurement on neighbor cell in a TDD band, the
following restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on the concerned
OFDM symbols and restricted symbols may partially or fully overlap with
UL symbols, where the concerned OFDM symbols are:

\- the same OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes configured for
L1-RSRP measurement, and- if UE supports
*multiCellL1-measRTD-greaterThan-CP-r18* capability, 1 OFDM symbol
before or after the OFDM symbols corresponding to the SSB indexes
configured for L1-RSRP measurement
