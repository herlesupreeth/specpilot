3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**ACL functionality:** as defined in TS 36.413 \[16\].

**CAG cell:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**DAPS Handover**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**Elementary Procedure:** NGAP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs).
An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the NG-RAN node
and the AMF. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are
intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner.
If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described
under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the
restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as
standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of
several NGAP EPs together or together with EPs from other interfaces is
specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 38.401 \[2\], TS 38.410
\[3\] and TS 38.300 \[8\]).

An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message.
Two kinds of EPs are used:

\- **Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or
failure).

\- **Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.

For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:

Successful:

\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary
procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.

Unsuccessful:

\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.

\- On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).

Successful and Unsuccessful:

\- One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful
outcome for the different included requests. The response message used
is the one defined for successful outcome.

Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.

**en-gNB**: as defined in TS 37.340 \[32\].

**gNB:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**MBS session resource**: as defined in TS 38.401 \[2\].

**Mobile IAB-MT**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**Mobile IAB-node**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**NB-IoT:** as defined in TS 36.300 \[17\].

**ng-eNB:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**NG-RAN node:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**Non-CAG cell:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**PDU session resource:** as defined in TS 38.401 \[2\].

**Public Network Integrated NPN:** as defined in TS 23.501 \[9\].

**Stand-alone Non-Public Network:** as defined in TS 23.501 \[9\].

4 General
=========

4.1 Procedure Specification Principles
--------------------------------------

The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the
functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any
rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be
possible to be verified with information that is visible within the
system.

The following specification principles have been applied for the
procedure text in clause 8:

\- The procedure text discriminates between:

1\) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the
REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with
the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure,
containing an appropriate cause value.

2\) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if
supported,\" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If
the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support
functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of
the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported
functionality.

\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does
not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a
response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For
requirements on including *Criticality Diagnostics* IE, see clause 10.

4.2 Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
----------------------------------------

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a
standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can
always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

4.3 Specification Notations
---------------------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification
the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g.,
Procedure Name procedure.

Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE
NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by
the word \"message\", e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.

IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification
the *Information Element Name* is written with the first letters in each
word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by
the abbreviation \"IE\", e.g., *Information Element* IE.

Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element
(IE) in the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in
subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., \"Value\".

5 NGAP Services
===============

NGAP provides the signalling service between the NG-RAN node and the AMF
that is required to fulfil the NGAP functions described in TS 38.410
\[3\]. NGAP services are divided into two groups:

> Non UE-associated services: They are related to the whole NG interface
> instance between the NG-RAN node and AMF utilising a non UE-associated
> signalling connection.
>
> UE-associated services: They are related to one UE. NGAP functions
> that provide these services are associated with a UE-associated
> signalling connection that is maintained for the UE in question.

6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
=============================================

The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of NGAP
messages. NGAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.

7 Functions of NGAP
===================

The functions of NGAP are described in TS 38.410 \[3\].

8 NGAP Procedures
=================

8.1 List of NGAP Elementary Procedures
--------------------------------------

In the following tables, all EPs are divided into Class 1 and Class 2
EPs (see subclause 3.1 for explanation of the different classes):

8.2 PDU Session Management Procedures
-------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 PDU Session Resource Setup

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure is to assign
resources on Uu and NG-U for one or several PDU sessions and the
corresponding QoS flows, and to setup corresponding DRBs for a given UE.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: PDU session resource setup: successful operation

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
REQUEST message to the NG-RAN node.

The PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the
information required by the NG-RAN node to setup the PDU session related
NG-RAN configuration consisting of at least one PDU session resource and
include each PDU session resource to setup in the *PDU Session Resource
Setup Request List* IE.

Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, if
resources are available for the requested configuration, the NG-RAN node
shall execute the requested NG-RAN configuration and allocate associated
resources over NG and over Uu for each PDU session listed in the *PDU
Session Resource Setup Request List* IE.

If the *RAN Paging Priority* IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a
priority for paging the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

For each requested PDU session, if resources are available for the
requested configuration, the NG-RAN node shall establish at least one
DRB and associate each accepted QoS flow of the PDU session which is not
associated with an MBS QoS flow to a DRB established.

For each PDU session successfully established the NG-RAN node shall pass
to the UE the *PDU Session* *NAS-PDU* IE, if included. The NG-RAN node
shall not send to the UE the PDU Session NAS PDUs associated to the
failed PDU sessions.

If the *NAS-PDU* IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall pass it to the UE.

For each PDU session the NG-RAN node shall store the *UL NG-U UP TNL
Information* IE included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request
Transfer* IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message
and use it as the uplink termination point for the user plane data for
this PDU session.

For each PDU session, if the *Additional UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE
is included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN
node may allocate for this split PDU session resources for an additional
NG-U transport bearer for some or all of the QoS flows present in the
*QoS Flow Setup Request List* IE and it shall indicate these QoS flows
in the *Additional DL QoS Flow per TNL Information* IE in the *PDU
Session Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE. In case the *Additional DL
QoS Flow per TNL Information* IE is not included the SMF shall consider
the proposed additional UL NG-U UP TNL information as available again.

For each PDU session, if the *Network Instance* IE is included in the
*PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE contained in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message and the *Common Network Instance*
IE is not present, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it when
selecting transport network resource as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *Common Network Instance* IE is included in
the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE or in the
*Additional UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE, or in the *Additional
Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE contained in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use
it when selecting transport network resource for the concerned NG-U
transport bearer as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE
is included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE of
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall,
if supported, use it as the uplink termination point for the user plane
data for this PDU session for the redundant transmission and it shall
include the *Redundant QoS Flow per TNL Information* IE in the *PDU
Session Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE as described in TS 23.501
\[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *Additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL
Information* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request
Transfer* IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST
message, the NG-RAN node may allocate for this split PDU session
resources for an additional redundant NG-U transport bearer for some or
all of the QoS flows present in the *QoS Flow Setup Request List* IE and
it shall indicate these QoS flows in the *Additional Redundant DL QoS
Flow per TNL Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer* IE. In case the *Additional* *Redundant DL QoS Flow per TNL
Information* IE is not included the SMF shall consider the proposed
additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL information as available again.

For each PDU session, if the *Redundant Common Network Instance* IE is
included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, use it when selecting transport network
resource for the redundant transmission as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *TSC Traffic Characteristics* IE is
included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, store it and use it as specified in TS 23.501
\[9\]. For each QoS flow which has been successfully established, if the
*Burst Arrival Time* IE is included in the *TSC Assistance Information
Uplink* IE of the *TSC Traffic Characteristics* IE, the NG-RAN node may
include the *AN Packet Delay Budget Uplink* IE for the same QoS flow
within the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message as specified in
TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the *RAN Feedback Type IE* is included in the *TSC
Traffic Characteristics* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, take
this information into account when determining the feedback to provide
in the *TSC Traffic Characteristics Feedback* IE in the *PDU Session
Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
RESPONSE message as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *PDU Session Type* IE included in the *PDU
Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP REQUEST message is set to \"ethernet\", the NG-RAN node may
perform appropriate header compression for the concerned PDU session, or
if it is set to \"unstructured\", the NG-RAN node shall not perform
header compression for the concerned PDU session.

For each PDU session for which the *Security Indication* IE is included
in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE of the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, and the *Integrity Protection
Indication* IE or *Confidentiality Protection Indication* IE is set to
\"required\", then the NG-RAN node shall perform user plane integrity
protection or ciphering, respectively, for the concerned PDU session. If
the NG-RAN node cannot perform the user plane integrity protection or
ciphering, it shall reject the setup of the PDU session resources with
an appropriate cause value.

If the NG-RAN node is an ng-eNB, it shall behave as specified in TS
33.501 \[13\].

For each PDU session for which the *Security Indication* IE is included
in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE of the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, and the *Integrity Protection
Indication* IE or *Confidentiality Protection Indication* IE is set to
\"preferred\", then the NG-RAN node should, if supported, perform user
plane integrity protection or ciphering, respectively, for the concerned
PDU session and shall notify whether it performed the user plane
integrity protection or ciphering by including the *Integrity Protection
Result* IE or *Confidentiality Protection Result* IE, respectively, in
the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message.

For each PDU session for which the *Maximum Integrity Protected Data
Rate Downlink* IE or the *Maximum Integrity Protected Data Rate Uplink*
IE are included in the *Security Indication* IE in the *PDU Session
Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall store the respective information
and, if integrity protection is to be performed for the PDU session, it
shall enforce the traffic limits corresponding to the received values,
for the concerned PDU session and concerned UE, as specified in TS
23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session for which the *Security Indication* IE is included
in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE of the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message:

\- if the *Integrity Protection Indication* IE is set to \"not needed\",
then the NG-RAN node shall not perform user plane integrity protection
for the concerned PDU session;

\- if the *Confidentiality Protection Indication* IE is set to \"not
needed\", then the NG-RAN node shall not perform user plane ciphering
for the concerned PDU session.

For each PDU session for which the *PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit
Rate* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request
Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the
NG-RAN node shall store the received value in the UE context and use it
when enforcing traffic policing for Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned
UE as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message,
if the *Additional QoS* *Flow Information* IE is included in the *QoS
Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request
Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the
NG-RAN node may consider it for the DRB allocation process. It is up to
NG-RAN node implementation to decide whether and how to use it.

For each PDU session in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message,
if the *Alternative QoS Parameters Set List* IE is included in the *GBR
QoS Flow Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request
Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the
NG-RAN node may accept the setup of the QoS flow when notification
control has been enabled if the requested QoS parameters or at least one
of the alternative QoS parameters sets can be fulfilled at the time of
setup. In case the NG-RAN node accepts the setup fulfilling one of the
alternative QoS parameters it shall indicate the alternative QoS
parameters set which it currently fulfils in the *Current QoS Parameters
Set Index* IE within the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer*
IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message. If the NG-RAN
node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message containing
the *Delay Critical* IE in the *Dynamic 5QI Descriptor* IE of the *QoS
Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE of the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request
Transfer* IE set to the value \"delay critical\" but the *Maximum Data
Burst Volume* IE is not present in the *Alternative QoS Parameters Set
List* IE, the NG-RAN node shall use the *Maximum Data Burst Volume* IE
included in the *Dynamic 5QI Descriptor* IE.

For each QoS flow which has been successfully established, the NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, store the *Redundant QoS* *Flow Indicator* IE
if included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message and consider
it for the redundant transmission as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each QoS flow which has been successfully established, if the *QoS
Monitoring Request* IE was included in the *QoS Flow Level QoS
Parameters* IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST
message, the NG-RAN node shall store this information, and, if
supported, perform delay measurement and QoS monitoring, as specified in
TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the *QoS Monitoring Reporting Frequency* IE was
included in the *QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE contained in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall store this
information and, if supported, use it for RAN part delay reporting.

For each QoS flow requested to be setup, if the *PDU Set QoS Parameters*
IE is included in the *QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE contained in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall,
if supported, store the received PDU Set QoS Parameters in the UE
context and use it as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the *ECN Marking
or Congestion Information Reporting Request* IE is included in the *PDU
Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE contained in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use
it accordingly for the specific QoS flow. If the *ECN Marking or
Congestion Information Reporting Status* IE is included in the *PDU
Session Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE, the SMF shall, if
supported, use it to deduce if ECN marking at NG-RAN or ECN marking at
UPF or congestion information reporting is active or not active.

For each QoS flow requested to be setup the NG-RAN node shall take into
account the received *QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE. For each QoS
flow the NG-RAN node shall establish or modify the resources according
to the values of the *Allocation and Retention Priority* IE (priority
level and pre-emption indicators) and the resource situation as follows:

\- The NG-RAN node shall consider the priority level of the requested
QoS flow, when deciding on the resource allocation.

\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (individually
or in combination) be used to determine whether the QoS flow setup has
to be performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested QoS
flow is marked as \"may trigger pre-emption\" and the resource situation
requires so, the NG-RAN node may trigger the pre-emption procedure which
may then cause the forced release of a lower priority QoS flow which is
marked as \"pre-emptable\". Whilst the process and the extent of the
pre-emption procedure are operator-dependent, the pre-emption indicators
shall be treated as follows:

1\. The values of the last received *Pre-emption Vulnerability* IE and
*Priority Level* IE shall prevail.

2\. If the *Pre-emption Capability* IE is set to \"may trigger
pre-emption\", then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption
procedure.

3\. If the *Pre-emption Capability* IE is set to \"shall not trigger
pre-emption\", then this allocation request shall not trigger the
pre-emption procedure.

4\. If the *Pre-emption Vulnerability* IE is set to \"pre-emptable\",
then this QoS flow shall be included in the pre-emption process.

5\. If the *Pre-emption Vulnerability* IE is set to \"not
pre-emptable\", then this QoS flow shall not be included in the
pre-emption process.

\- The NG-RAN node pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:

1\. The NG-RAN node shall only pre‑empt QoS flows with lower priority,
in ascending order of priority.

2\. The pre-emption may be done for QoS flows belonging to the same UE
or to other UEs.

For each QoS flow which has been successfully established, the NG-RAN
node shall store the mapped E-RAB ID if included in the *PDU Session
Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE contained in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message and use it as specified in TS 38.300
\[8\].

For each PDU session, if the *Redundant PDU Session Information* IE is
included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, store the received information in the UE
context and setup the redundant user plane for the redundant PDU session
as specified in TS38.300 \[8\] and TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the *PDU Session
Type* IE is set to "ethernet" and the redundancy requirement is
fulfilled using a secondary NG-RAN node, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, include the *Global RAN Node ID of Secondary NG-RAN Node* IE
in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE of the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message. If the *PDU Session Pair ID* IE
is included in the *Redundant PDU Session Information* IE, the NG-RAN
node may use it to identify the paired PDU sessions.

The NG-RAN node shall report to the AMF in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP RESPONSE message the result for each PDU session resource
requested to be setup:

\- For each PDU session resource successfully setup, the *PDU Session
Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE shall be included containing:

1\. The NG-U UP transport layer information to be used for the PDU
session and associated list of QoS flows which have been successfully
established, in the *QoS Flow per TNL Information* IE.

2\. The list of QoS flows which failed to be established, if any, in the
*QoS Flow Failed to Setup List* IE. When the NG-RAN node reports
unsuccessful establishment of a QoS flow, the cause value should be
precise enough to enable the SMF to know the reason for the unsuccessful
establishment.

\- For each PDU session resource which failed to be setup, the *PDU
Session Resource Setup Unsuccessful Transfer* IE shall be included
containing a cause value that should be precise enough to enable the SMF
to know the reason for the unsuccessful establishment.

Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message the
AMF shall, for each PDU session indicated in the *PDU Session ID* IE,
transfer transparently the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer* IE or *PDU Session Resource Setup Unsuccessful Transfer* IE to
the SMF associated with the concerned PDU session.

Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message to
setup a QoS flow for IMS voice, if the NG-RAN node is not able to
support IMS voice, the NG-RAN node shall initiate EPS fallback or RAT
fallback for IMS voice procedure as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\] and
report unsuccessful establishment of the QoS flow in the *PDU Session
Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE or in the *PDU Session Resource
Setup Unsuccessful Transfer* IE with cause value \"IMS voice EPS
fallback or RAT fallback triggered\".

For each PDU session for which the *Global RAN Node ID of Secondary
NG-RAN Node* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message, the SMF
shall, if supported, handle this information as specified in TS 23.501
\[9\].

The *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE should be sent to the NG-RAN node
if the AMF has not sent it previously. If it is included in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall store the
UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context, and use the received UE
Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for all Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned
UE as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *PDU Session Expected UE Activity
Behaviour* IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST
message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, handle this information as
specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *UE Slice Maximum Bit Rate List* IE is included in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, store the UE Slice Maximum Bit Rate List in the UE context,
and use it for each S-NSSAI for the concerned UE as specified in TS
23.501 \[9\].

The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP RESPONSE message location information of the UE in the *User
Location Information* IE.

If the *User Location Information* IE is included in the PDU *SESSION*
RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message, the AMF shall handle this information
as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *Downlink* *TL Container* IE is included in
the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
handle it as specified in TS 29.585 \[56\] and shall include the
*Uplink* *TL Container* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer* IE as specified in TS 29.585 \[56\].

If the *PDU Set QoS Parameters* IE is included in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message the *PDU Set
based Handling Indicator* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer* IE. If the *PDU Set based Handling Indicator* IE is included
in the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE in the PDU
*SESSION* RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message, the SMF shall, if supported,
handle this information as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *MBS Support Indicator* IE is included in the *PDU Session
Resource Setup Response Transfer* IE in the PDU *SESSION* RESOURCE SETUP
RESPONSE message, the SMF shall, if supported, handle this information
as specified in TS 23.247 \[44\].

**Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:**

If a handover becomes necessary during the PDU Session Resource Setup
procedure, the NG-RAN node may interrupt the ongoing PDU Session
Resource Setup procedure and initiate the Handover Preparation procedure
as follows:

1\. The NG-RAN node shall send the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE
message in which the NG-RAN node shall indicate, if necessary, all the
PDU session resources which failed to be setup with an appropriate cause
value, e.g. \"NG intra-system handover triggered\", \"NG inter-system
handover triggered\" or \"Xn handover triggered\".

2\. The NG-RAN node shall trigger the handover procedure.

### 8.2.2 PDU Session Resource Release

#### 8.2.2.1 General

The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Release procedure is to enable
the release of already established PDU session resources for a given UE.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-1: PDU session resource release: successful operation

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE
RELEASE COMMAND message.

The PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message shall contain the
information required by the NG-RAN node to release at least one PDU
session resource, and include each PDU session resource to release in
the *PDU Session Resource to Release List* IE.

If a *NAS-PDU* IE is contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE
COMMAND message, the NG-RAN node shall pass it to the UE.

Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message the
NG-RAN node shall execute the release of the requested PDU sessions. For
each PDU session to be released the NG-RAN node shall release the
corresponding resources over Uu and over NG, if any.

If the *RAN Paging Priority* IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
RELEASE COMMAND message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a
priority for paging the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
RELEASE RESPONSE message location information of the UE in the *User
Location Information* IE.

After sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE RESPONSE message, the
NG-RAN node shall be prepared to receive a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
REQUEST message requesting establishment of a PDU session with a PDU
Session ID corresponding to one of the PDU Session IDs that was present
in the *PDU Session Resource to Release List* IE of the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message.

If the *User Location Information* IE is included in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE RELEASE RESPONSE message, the AMF shall handle this information
as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session for which the *Secondary RAT Usage Information* IE
is included in the *PDU Session Resource Release Response Transfer* IE,
the SMF shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502 \[10\].

For each PDU session, if the *Downlink* *TL Container* IE for a QoS flow
is included in the *PDU Session Resource Release Command Transfer* IE of
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message, the NG-RAN node shall,
if supported, handle it as specified in TS 29.585 \[56\] and shall
include the *Uplink* *TL Container* IE for the indicated QoS flow in the
*PDU Session Resource Release Response Transfer* IE as specified in TS
29.585 \[56\].

#### 8.2.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation

The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation
section.

#### 8.2.2.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND
message containing multiple *PDU Session ID* IEs (in the *PDU Session
Resource to Release List* IE) set to the same value, the NG-RAN node
shall initiate the release of one corresponding PDU session and ignore
the duplication of the instances of the selected corresponding PDU
sessions.

### 8.2.3 PDU Session Resource Modify

#### 8.2.3.1 General

The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure is to enable
configuration modifications of already established PDU session(s) for a
given UE. It is also to enable the setup, modification and release of
the QoS flow for already established PDU session(s). The procedure uses
UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.3.2 Successful Operation

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
REQUEST message to the NG-RAN node.

The PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message shall contain the
information required by the NG-RAN node, which may trigger the NG-RAN
configuration modification for the existing PDU sessions listed in the
*PDU Session Resource Modify Request List* IE.

Upon reception of the PDU *SESSION* RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, if
the NG-RAN configuration is triggered to be modified and if resources
are available for the modified NG-RAN configuration, the NG-RAN node
shall execute the configuration modification for the requested PDU
session.

If the *RAN Paging Priority* IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a
priority for paging the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

For each PDU session, if the *S-NSSAI* IE is included in the *PDU

*PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE contained in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message and the *Common Network
Instance* IE is not present, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it
as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *Common Network Instance* IE is included in
the *PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE or in the
*Additional UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE, or in the *Additional
Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE contained in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
use it when selecting transport network resource for the concerned NG-U
transport bearer as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *Redundant Common Network Instance* IE is
included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, use it for the redundant transmission as
specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *TSC Traffic Characteristics* IE is
included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, store it and use it as specified in TS 23.501
\[9\]. If the *RAN Feedback Type IE* is included in the *TSC Traffic
Characteristics* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, take this
information into account when determining the feedback to provide in the
*TSC Traffic Characteristics Feedback* IE in the *PDU Session Resource
Modify Response Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE
message as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session, if the *Redundant QoS Flow Indicator* IE is
included and set to "false" for all QoS flows, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, stop the redundant transmission and release the redundant
tunnel for the concerned PDU session as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

NG-RAN node may accept the setup of the QoS flow when notification
control has been enabled if the requested QoS parameters or at least one
of the alternative QoS parameters sets can be fulfilled at the time of
setup. In case the NG-RAN node accepts the setup fulfilling one of the
alternative QoS parameters it shall indicate the alternative QoS
parameters set which it currently fulfils in the *Current QoS Parameters
Set Index* IE within the *PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer*
IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message. If the NG-RAN
node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message containing
the *Delay Critical* IE in the *Dynamic 5QI Descriptor* IE of the *QoS
Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE of the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Request Transfer* IE set to the value \"delay critical\" but the
*Maximum Data Burst Volume* IE is not present in the *Alternative QoS
Parameters Set List* IE, the NG-RAN node shall use the *Maximum Data
Burst Volume* IE included in the *Dynamic 5QI Descriptor* IE.

For each PDU session included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Request List* IE:

\- For each QoS flow included in the *QoS Flow Add or Modify Request
List* IE, based on the *QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE, the NG-RAN
node may establish, modify or release the DRB configuration and may
change allocation of resources on NG or Uu accordingly. The NG-RAN node
shall associate each QoS flow accepted to setup or modify which is not
associated with an MBS QoS flow with a DRB of the PDU session. The
associated DRB for the QoS flow accepted to modify may not change. If
the *PDU Set QoS Parameters* IE is received, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, store the received PDU Set QoS Parameters in the UE context
and use it as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the *ECN Marking or
Congestion Information Reporting Request* IE is included in the *PDU
Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE contained in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, use it accordingly for the specific QoS flow. If the *ECN
Marking or Congestion Information Reporting Status* IE is included in

\- For each QoS flow, if the *Burst Arrival Time* IE is included in the
*TSC Assistance Information Uplink* IE of the *TSC Traffic
Characteristics* IE, the NG-RAN node may include the *AN Packet Delay
Budget Uplink* IE for the same QoS flow within the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
MODIFY RESPONSE message as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

\- If the *NAS-PDU* IE is received for the PDU session, the NG-RAN node
shall pass it to the UE only if at least one of the requests included in
the *PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE is successful
(i.e. the PDU session is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Response Item* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message).

\- The NG-RAN node may change allocation of resources on NG according to
the requested target configuration.

\- If the *PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is included in the
*PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE, the NG-RAN node shall
store and use the received PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate value
when enforcing traffic policing for Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned
UE as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

allocate resources for an additional NG-U transport bearer for some or
all of the QoS flows present in the *QoS Flow Add or Modify Request
List* IE and it shall indicate these QoS flows in the *Additional DL QoS
Flow per TNL Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Response Transfer* IE. In case the *Additional DL QoS Flow per TNL
Information* IE is not included the SMF shall consider the proposed
additional UL NG-U UP TNL information as available again.

\- In case more than one NG-U transport bearers have been set up for the
PDU session, if all the QoS flows associated to one existing NG-U
transport bearer are included in the *QoS Flow to Release List* IE in
the *PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE, the NG-RAN node
and 5GC shall consider that the concerned NG-U transport bearer is
removed for the PDU session, and both NG-RAN node and 5GC shall
therefore consider the related NG-U UP TNL information as available
again.

\- If the *Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE within the *UL NG-U
UP TNL Modify List* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Request Transfer* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, update the
transport layer information for the uplink data accordingly for the
concerned transport bearer identified by the *Redundant DL NG-U UP TNL
Information* IE included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Request
Transfer* IE for the concerned PDU session.

\- If the *Additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE is

NG-RAN node may allocate resources for an additional redundant NG-U
transport bearer for some or all of the QoS flows present in the *QoS
Flow Add or Modify Request List* IE and it shall, if supported, indicate
these QoS flows in the *Additional Redundant DL QoS Flow per TNL
Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer*
IE. In case the *Additional Redundant DL QoS Flow per TNL Information*
IE is not included the SMF shall consider the proposed additional
Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL information as available again.

\- If the *Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE is included in the
*PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE, the NG-RAN node may
allocate resources for a redundant NG-U transport bearer for some or all
of the QoS flows present in the *QoS Flow Add or Modify Request List* IE
and it shall, if supported, indicate the corresponding NG-RAN endpoint
of this NG-U transport bearer in the *Redundant DL NG-U UP TNL
Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer*
IE.

\- If the *Security Indication* IE is included in the *PDU Session
Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, only update the maximum integrity protected data rate uplink
and/or the maximum integrity protected data rate downlink, and take them
into account as defined in the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure.

\- If the *User Plane Failure Indication* IE is included in the *PDU
Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, consider that the NG-U tunnel established for the PDU session
experienced a user plane failure, and perform one of the below actions:

\- trigger the PDU Session Resource Notify procedure to release the
tunnel and the associated QoS flows, in which case it shall set the
*User Plane Failure Indication Report* IE in the *PDU Session Resource
Modify Response Transfer* IE to \"QoS flows and tunnel to be released\".

\- trigger the PDU Session Resource Modify Indication procedure to move
the associated QoS flows to the other existing tunnel, in which case it
shall set the *User Plane Failure Indication Report* IE in the *PDU
Session Resource Modify Response Transfer* IE to \"QoS flows to be
moved\".

\- decide to establish a new NG-U tunnel to replace the failed one, in
which case it shall include, as applicable, either the new *DL NG-U UP
TNL Information* IE or the *Additional DL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE,
and set the *User Plane Failure Indication Report* IE in the *PDU
Session Resource Modify Response Transfer* IE to \"new transport address
allocated\" and use the *UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE in the *User
Plane Failure Indication* IE for the uplink data.

For each QoS flow which has been successfully added or modified, if the
*QoS Monitoring Request* IE was included in the *QoS Flow Level QoS
Parameters* IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST
message, the NG-RAN node shall store this information, and, if
supported, perform delay measurement and QoS monitoring, as specified in
TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the *QoS Monitoring Reporting Frequency* IE was

#### 8.2.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation
section.

#### 8.2.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST
message containing several *PDU Session ID* IEs (in the *PDU Session
Resource Modify Request List* IE) set to the same value, the NG-RAN node
shall report the modification of the corresponding PDU sessions as
failed in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message with an
appropriate cause value.

If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST
message containing some *PDU Session ID* IEs (in the *PDU Session
Resource Modify Request List* IE) that the NG-RAN node does not
recognize, the NG-RAN node shall report the corresponding invalid PDU
sessions as failed in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message
with an appropriate cause value.

If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST
message containing a *QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters* IE in *the PDU
Session Resource Modify Request Transfer* IE for a GBR QoS flow but the
*GBR QoS Flow Information* IE is not present, the NG-RAN node shall
report the addition or modification of the corresponding QoS flow as
failed in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer* IE of the

corresponding QoS flow already exists.

### 8.2.4 PDU Session Resource Notify

#### 8.2.4.1 General

The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Notify procedure is to notify
that the already established QoS flow(s) or PDU session(s) for a given
UE are released or not fulfilled anymore or fulfilled again by the
NG-RAN node for which notification control is requested. It is also used
to notify that the updated QoS parameters during the Path Switch Request
procedure are not successfully accepted by the NG-RAN node. The
procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.4.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.4.2-1: PDU session resource notify

The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION
RESOURCE NOTIFY message.

The PDU SESSION RESOURCE NOTIFY message shall contain the information of
PDU session resources or QoS flows which are released or not fulfilled
anymore or fulfilled again by the NG-RAN node.

\- For each PDU session for which some QoS flows are released or not
fulfilled anymore or fulfilled again by the NG-RAN node, the *PDU
Session Resource Notify Transfer* IE shall be included containing:

1\. The list of QoS flows which are released by the NG-RAN node, if any,
in the *QoS Flow Released List* IE. If no more QoS flow is associated to
an existing bearer after the release (e.g. split PDU session), the
NG-RAN node and 5GC shall consider that the concerned NG-U transport
bearer is removed and the related NG-U UP TNL information is available
again.

2\. The list of GBR QoS flows which are not fulfilled anymore or
fulfilled again by the NG-RAN node, if any, in the *QoS Flow Notify
List* IE together with the *Notification Cause* IE. For a QoS flow
indicated as not fulfilled anymore the NG-RAN node may also indicate an
alternative QoS parameters set which it can currently fulfil in the
*Current QoS Parameters Set Index* IE. For a QoS flow indicated as not
fulfilled anymore the NG-RAN node may also indicate the RAN feedback in
the *TSC Traffic Characteristics Feedback* IE.

3\. The list of QoS flows for which the QoS parameters were updated but
could not be successfully accepted by the NG-RAN node during the Path
Switch Request procedure, if any, in the *QoS Flow Feedback List* IE
which may be associated with a value it could offer.

\- For each PDU session resource which is released by the NG-RAN node,
the *PDU Session Resource Notify Released Transfer* IE shall be included
containing the release cause in the *Cause* IE. If the *User Plane Error
Indicator* IE is set to \"GTP-U Error Indication Received\", the SMF
shall, if supported, consider that the PDU session is released due to
GTP-U Error Indication received over the NG-U tunnel, as specified in
3GPP TS 23.527 \[57\].

The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
NOTIFY message location information of the UE in the *User Location
Information* IE.

Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE NOTIFY message, the AMF
shall, for each PDU session indicated in the *PDU Session ID* IE,
transfer transparently the *PDU Session Resource Notify Transfer* IE or
*PDU Session Resource Notify Released Transfer* IE to the SMF associated

### 8.2.5 PDU Session Resource Modify Indication

#### 8.2.5.1 General

The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Modify Indication procedure is
for the NG-RAN node to request modification of the established PDU
session(s). The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.5.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.5.2-1: PDU session resource modify indication: successful
operation

The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION
RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message. Upon reception of the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message, the AMF shall, for each PDU session
indicated in the *PDU Session ID* IE, transparently transfer the *PDU
Session Resource Modify Indication Transfer* IE to the SMF associated
with the concerned PDU session.

For each PDU session for which the *DL QoS Flow per TNL Information* IE
is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Indication Transfer* IE
in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message, the SMF shall, if
the request is accepted, consider the included DL transport layer
address as the DL transport layer address for the included associated
QoS flows and provide the associated UL transport layer address in the
*UL NG-U UP TNL Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Confirm Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM message.

For each PDU session for which the *Additional DL QoS Flow per TNL
Information* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Indication Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION
message, the SMF shall, if supported, consider for this split PDU
session each included DL transport layer address(es) as the DL transport
layer address(s) for the included associated QoS flows and it may
provide the associated UL transport layer address(s) in the *Additional
NG-U UP TNL Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Confirm
Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM message.

In case more than one NG-U transport bearers have been set up for the
PDU session, the *DL QoS Flow per TNL Information* IE and the
*Additional DL QoS Flow per TNL Information* IE in the *PDU Session
Resource Modify Indication Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
MODIFY INDICATION message shall be included if at least one QoS flow is
associated to their respective NG-U transport bearer; if no QoS flow is
associated to one existing NG-U transport bearer after the modification,
the NG-RAN node and 5GC shall consider that the concerned NG-U transport
bearer is removed for the PDU session, and both NG-RAN node and 5GC
shall therefore consider the related NG-U UP TNL information as
available again.

For each PDU session for which the *Redundant DL QoS Flow per TNL
Information* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Indication Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION
message, the SMF shall, if supported, consider the included DL transport
layer address as the new DL transport layer address for the included
associated QoS flows for redundant transmission and it may provide the
associated UL transport layer address in the *Redundant* *UL NG-U UP TNL
Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Confirm Transfer* IE
in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM message.

For each PDU session for which the *Additional Redundant DL QoS Flow per
TNL Information* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Indication Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION
message, the SMF shall, if supported, consider for this split PDU
session each included DL transport layer address(es) as the new downlink
termination point(s) for the included associated QoS flows and it may
provide the associated UL transport layer address(s) in the *Additional
Redundant NG-U UP TNL Information* IE in the *PDU Session Resource
Modify Confirm Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM
message for the redundant transmission.

For each PDU session for which the *Global RAN Node ID of Secondary
NG-RAN Node* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify
Indication Transfer* IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION
message, the SMF shall, if supported, handle this information as
specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *Security Result* IE is included in the *PDU Session Resource
Modify Indication Transfer* IE in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
INDICATION message, it shall be considered by the SMF as the new
security status of the PDU session.

If the *ECN Marking or Congestion Information Reporting Status* IE is
included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Indication Transfer* IE in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message, the SMF shall, if
supported, use it to deduce if ECN marking at NG-RAN or ECN marking at
UPF or congestion information reporting is active or not active as
described in TS 23.501 \[9\].

For each PDU session for which the *Secondary RAT Usage Information* IE
is included in the *PDU Session Resource Modify Indication Transfer* IE,
the SMF shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502 \[10\].

The AMF shall report to the NG-RAN node in the PDU SESSION MODIFY
RESOURCE CONFIRM message the result for each PDU session listed in PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message:

\- For each PDU session which is successfully modified, the *PDU Session
Resource Modify Confirm Transfer* IE *shall* be included containing:

1\. The list of QoS flows which have been successfully modified in the
*QoS Flow Modify Confirm List* IE.

2\. The list of QoS flows which have failed to be modified, if any, in
the *QoS Flow Failed to Modify List* IE.

\- For each PDU session which failed to be modified, the *PDU Session
Resource Modify Indication Unsuccessful Transfer* IE *shall* be included
to report the failure cause.

Upon reception of the *PDU Session* *Resource Modify Confirm Transfer*
IE for each PDU session listed in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
CONFIRM message:

\- If the *QoS Flow Failed To Modify List* IE is included, the NG-RAN
node shall either

1\. de-associate the corresponding DRB for the concerned QoS flow, or

2\. keep the previous transport layer information before sending the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION unchanged for the concerned QoS flow.

Upon reception of the *PDU Session* *Resource Modify Indication
Unsuccessful Transfer* IE for each PDU session listed in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE MODIFY CONFIRM message, the NG-RAN node shall either:

1\. release all corresponding NG-RAN configuration and resources for the
concerned PDU session, or

2\. keep the previous transport layer information before sending the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION unchanged for the concerned PDU
session.

The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
MODIFY INDICATION message location information of the UE in the *User
Location Information* IE.

**Interactions with PDU Session Resource Setup procedure or PDU Session
Resource Modification procedure:**

If the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY INDICATION message is received by the
AMF during an ongoing PDU Session Resource Setup procedure or an ongoing
PDU Session Resource Modification procedure, the AMF shall proceed with
the PDU Session Resource Modify Indication procedure.

If the *PDU Session Resource Modify Indication Transfer* IE is received
by the SMF during an ongoing PDU Session Resource Setup procedure or an
ongoing PDU Session Resource Modification procedure, the SMF shall
process the *PDU Session Resource Modify Indication Transfer* IE.

The purpose of the Initial Context Setup procedure is to establish the
necessary overall initial UE context at the NG-RAN node, when required,
including PDU session context, the Security Key, Mobility Restriction
List, UE Radio Capability and UE Security Capabilities, etc. The AMF may
initiate the Initial Context Setup procedure if a UE-associated logical
NG-connection exists for the UE or if the AMF has received the *RAN UE
NGAP ID* IE in an INITIAL UE MESSAGE message or if the NG-RAN node has
already initiated a UE-associated logical NG-connection by sending an
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message via another NG interface instance. The
procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

For signalling only connections and if the *UE Context Request* IE is
not received in the Initial UE Message, the AMF may be configured to
trigger the procedure for all NAS procedures or on a per NAS procedure
basis depending on operator's configuration.

#### 8.3.1.2 Successful Operation

same as defined in the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure. The NG-RAN
node shall report to the AMF in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE
message the result for each PDU session resource requested to be setup
as defined in the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure.

Upon reception of the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message the AMF
shall, for each PDU session indicated in the *PDU Session ID* IE,
transfer transparently the *PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer* IE or *PDU Session Resource Setup Unsuccessful Transfer* IE to
the SMF associated with the concerned PDU session. In case the splitting
PDU session is not used by the NG-RAN node, the SMF should remove the
Additional Transport Layer Information, if any.

8.4 UE Mobility Management Procedures
-------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Handover Preparation

#### 8.4.1.1 General

The purpose of the Handover Preparation procedure is to request the
preparation of resources at the target side via the 5GC. There is only
one Handover Preparation procedure ongoing at the same time for a
certain UE. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.4.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.1.2-1: Handover preparation: successful operation

The source NG-RAN node initiates the handover preparation by sending the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message to the serving AMF. When the source NG-RAN
node sends the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, it shall start the timer
TNG~RELOCprep.~ The source NG-RAN node shall indicate the appropriate
cause value for the handover in the *Cause* IE.

Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message the AMF shall, for each
PDU session indicated in the *PDU Session ID* IE, transparently transfer
the *Handover Required Transfer* IE to the SMF associated with the
concerned PDU session. If the UE is a mobile IAB-MT and the *PDU Session
ID* IE contained in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicates no PDU
session identity assigned as defined in TS 24.007 \[58\], the AMF shall,
if supported, consider the mobile IAB-MT has no PDU session, ignore the
*PDU Session Resource List* IE, and behave as specified in TS 23.501
\[9\].

In case of intra-system handover, the information in the *Source to
Target Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according to the
definition of the *Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent
Container* IE.

If the *DL Forwarding* IE is included for a given QoS flow in the *PDU
Session Resource Information Item* IE within the *Source NG-RAN Node to
Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container* IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED
message and it is set to \"DL forwarding proposed\", it indicates that
the source NG-RAN node proposes forwarding of downlink data for that QoS
flow.

If the *UL Forwarding* IE is included for a given QoS flow in the *PDU
Session Resource Information Item* IE within the *Source NG-RAN Node to
Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container* IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED
message and it is set to \"UL forwarding proposed\", it indicates that
the source NG-RAN node proposes forwarding of uplink data for that QoS
flow.

If the *DRBs to QoS Flows Mapping List* IE is included in the *PDU
Session Resource Information Item* IE within the *Source NG-RAN Node to
Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container* IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED
message, it implicitly indicates that the source NG-RAN node proposes
forwarding of downlink data for those DRBs.

If the *QoS Flow Mapping Indication* IE for a QoS flow is included in
the *Associated QoS Flow List* IE within the *DRBs to QoS Flows Mapping
List* IE within the *Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node
Transparent Container* IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, it indicates
that the source NG-RAN node has mapped only the uplink or downlink of
the QoS flow to the DRB.

The source NG-RAN node shall, for each MRB of each MBS session contained
in the *MBS Session Information Target to Source List* IE, start data
forwarding to the TNL address contained in the *DL Forwarding UP TNL
Information* IE. If the *MRB Progress Information IE is contained for an
MRB in the Data Forwarding Response MRB List IE in the MBS Session
Information Target to Source List* IE, the source NG-RAN node may use
this information to determine when to stop data forwarding.

In case of intra-system handover, if the HANDOVER COMMAND message
contains the *DL Forwarding UP TNL Information* IE for a given DRB
within the *Data Forwarding Response DRB List* IE in the *Handover
Command Transfer* IE, the source NG-RAN node shall consider that the
forwarding of downlink data for this DRB is accepted by the target
NG-RAN node. If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the *UL Forwarding
UP TNL Information* IE for a given DRB in the *Data Forwarding Response
DRB List* IE within the *Handover Command Transfer* IE, it means the
target NG-RAN node has requested the forwarding of uplink data for this
DRB.

In case direct data forwarding is applied for inter-system handover, if
the *Data Forwarding Response E-RAB List* IE in the *Handover Command
Transfer* IE is included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the source
NG-RAN node shall consider that forwarding of downlink data for this
E-RAB is accepted by the target eNB.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the *UL Forwarding UP TNL
Information* IE for a given PDU session within the *Handover Command
Transfer* IE, the source NG-RAN node shall consider that the forwarding
of uplink data of the QoS flows is accepted by the target NG-RAN node.

In case of inter-system handover to LTE, the information in the *Source
to Target Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according to the
*Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE definition as
specified in TS 36.413 \[16\].

If the *Direct Forwarding Path Availability* IE is included in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message the AMF shall handle it as specified in TS
23.502 \[10\].

If the *Direct Forwarding Path Availability* IE is included within the
*Handover Required Transfer* IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message the SMF
shall handle it as specified in TS 23.502 \[10\].

When the preparation, including the reservation of resources at the
target side is ready, the AMF responds with the HANDOVER COMMAND message
to the source NG-RAN node. In case of intra-system handover, the AMF
shall include the *PDU Session Resource Handover List* IE in the
HANDOVER COMMAND message.

Upon reception of the HANDOVER COMMAND message the source NG-RAN node
shall stop the timer TNG~RELOCprep~ and start the timer
TNG~RELOCoverall~.

If there are any PDU sessions that could not be admitted in the target,
they shall be indicated in the *PDU Session Resource to Release List*
IE.

NOTE: As an exception in case of inter-system handover to LTE, the AMF
generates the *Handover Preparation Unsuccessful Transfer* IE in the
*PDU Session Resource to Release List* IE.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the ***QoS Flow to be Forwarded
List*** *IE* *and/or Data Forwarding Response DRB List IE* within the
*Handover Command Transfer* IE for a given PDU session*,* then the
source NG-RAN node should initiate data forwarding for the QoS flows *as
specified in TS 38.300 \[8\]*.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the *Additional DL Forwarding
UP TNL Information* IE within the *Handover Command Transfer* IE, the
source NG-RAN node should initiate data forwarding of the PDU session
split in different tunnel and shall use the received UP transport layer
information for the forwarding QoS flows associated to it.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the *Additional UL Forwarding
UP TNL Information* IE within the *Handover Command Transfer* IE, the
source NG-RAN node should initiate data forwarding of the PDU session
split in different tunnels using the received UP transport layer
information.

If the *NAS Security Parameters from NG-RAN* IE is included in the
HANDOVER COMMAND message the NG-RAN node shall use it as specified in TS
33.501 \[13\].

If the *Target to Source Transparent Container* IE has been received by
the AMF from the handover target then the transparent container shall be
included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the *QoS Flow Failed to Setup
List* IE within the *Handover Command Transfer* IE, the source NG-RAN
node shall consider that the listed QoS flows are failed to be handed
over.

In case of inter-system handover to LTE, the information in the *Target
to Source Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according to the
definition of the *Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container* IE as
specified in TS 36.413 \[16\].

If the *Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority* IE is contained in
the *Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container* IE,
the target NG-RAN node shall store the content of the received *Index to
RAT/Frequency Selection Priority* IE in the UE context and use it as
defined in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *DAPS Request Information* IE is included for a DRB in the
*Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container* IE
within the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, it indicates that the request
concerns a DAPS Handover for that DRB, as described in TS 38.300 \[8\].

**Interactions with other NGAP procedures:**

If, after a HANDOVER REQUIRED message is sent and before the Handover
Preparation procedure is terminated, the source NG-RAN node receives an
AMF initiated PDU Session Management procedure on the same UE-associated
signalling connection, the source NG-RAN node shall either:

1\. Cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by executing the Handover
Cancellation procedure with an appropriate cause value. After successful
completion of the Handover Cancellation procedure, the source NG-RAN
node shall continue the AMF initiated PDU Session Management procedure.

or

2\. Terminate the AMF initiated PDU Session Management procedure by
sending the appropriate response message with an appropriate cause
value, e.g. \"NG intra-system handover triggered\" or \"NG inter-system
handover triggered\" to the AMF and then the source NG-RAN node shall
continue with the handover procedure.

#### 8.4.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.4.1.3-1: Handover preparation: unsuccessful operation

If the 5GC or the target side is not able to accept any of the PDU
session resources or a failure occurs during the Handover Preparation,
the AMF sends the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message with an
appropriate cause value to the source NG-RAN node.

If the *Target to Source Failure Transparent Container* IE has been
received by the AMF from the handover target then the transparent
container shall be included in the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.

If the *Target to Source Failure Transparent Container* IE is received
in the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message including the *Cell CAG
Information* IE, the source NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store and
replace the PNI-NPN information associated with the indicated cell.

**Interaction with Handover Cancel procedure:**

If there is no response from the AMF to the HANDOVER REQUIRED message
before timer TNG~RELOCprep~ expires in the source NG-RAN node, the
source NG-RAN node should cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by
initiating the Handover Cancel procedure with the appropriate value for
the *Cause* IE. The source NG-RAN node shall ignore any HANDOVER COMMAND
message or HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message received after the
initiation of the Handover Cancel procedure.

#### 8.4.1.4 Abnormal Conditions

In case of inter-system handover, if the NG-RAN node receives at least
one PDU Session ID included in the ***PDU Session Resource Handover
List** IE without at least one valid associated GTP tunnel address pair
(in either UL or DL), then the NG-RAN node shall consider it as a
logical error and act as described in subclause 10.4. A GTP tunnel
address pair is considered valid if both the GTP-TEID IE and the
Endpoint IP Address IE are present.*

### 8.4.2 Handover Resource Allocation

#### 8.4.2.1 General

The purpose of the Handover Resource Allocation procedure is to reserve
resources at the target NG-RAN node for the handover of a UE. The
procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.4.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.2.2-1: Handover resource allocation: successful operation

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST message
to the target NG-RAN node.

If the *Masked IMEISV* IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it to determine the
characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.

Upon receipt of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target NG-RAN node
shall

\- attempt to execute the requested PDU session configuration and
associated security;

\- store the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context,
and use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for all Non-GBR QoS

context and use it as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

Upon reception of the *UE History Information* IE, which is included
within the *Source to Target Transparent Container* IE of the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall collect the information
defined as mandatory in the *UE History Information* IE and shall, if
supported, collect the information defined as optional in the *UE
History Information* IE, for as long as the UE stays in one of its
cells, and store the collected information to be used for future
handover preparations.

Upon receiving the *PDU Session Resource Setup List* IE contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message and the HANDOVER REQUEST message does not
contain the *No PDU Session Indication* IE, the target NG-RAN node shall
behave the same as defined in the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure.
The target NG-RAN node shall report to the AMF in the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message the result for each PDU session resource requested
to be setup. In particular, for each PDU session resource successfully
setup, it shall include the *Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE
containing the following information:

\- The list of QoS flows which have been successfully established in the
*QoS Flow Setup Response List* IE.

message includes the *PDU Set QoS Parameters* IE.

\- The ECN Marking or Congestion Information Reporting Status if the
HANDOVER REQUEST message includes the *ECN Marking or Congestion
Information Reporting Request* IE.

For each PDU session resource which failed to be setup, the *Handover
Resource Allocation Unsuccessful Transfer* IE shall be included in the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message containing a cause value that
should be precise enough to enable the SMF to know the reason for the
unsuccessful establishment.

For each PDU session included in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message, if the *Current QoS Parameters Set Index* IE is included for a
QoS flow in the *QoS Flow Setup Response List* IE within the *Handover
Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE the SMF shall consider it as the
currently fulfilled QoS parameters set among the alternative QoS
parameters for the involved QoS flow.

Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the AMF
shall, for each PDU session indicated in the *PDU Session ID* IE,
transfer transparently the *Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE or
*Handover Resource Allocation Unsuccessful Transfer* IE to the SMF
associated with the concerned PDU session.

If the HANDOVER REQUEST message contains the *Data Forwarding Not
Possible* IE associated with a given PDU session within the *Handover
Request Transfer* IE set to \"data forwarding not possible\", the target
NG-RAN node may not include the *DL Forwarding UP TNL Information* IE
and for intra-system handover the *Data Forwarding Response DRB List* IE
within the *Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE in the HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message for that PDU session.

If the HANDOVER REQUEST message contains the *Redundant PDU Session
Information* IE associated with a given PDU session within the *Handover
Request Transfer* IE, the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store
the received information in the UE context and use it for redundant PDU
session setup as specified in TS38.300 \[8\] and TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the
*PDU Session Type* IE is set to "ethernet" and the redundancy
requirement is fulfilled using a secondary NG-RAN node, the NG-RAN node
shall, if supported, include the *Global RAN Node ID of Secondary NG-RAN
Node* IE in the *Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE of the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. If the *PDU Session Pair ID* IE is
included in the *Redundant PDU Session Information* IE, the NG-RAN node
may use it to identify the paired PDU sessions.

For each PDU session for which the *Global RAN Node ID of Secondary
NG-RAN Node* IE is included in the *Handover Request Acknowledge
Transfer* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the SMF shall,
if supported, handle this information as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

In case of intra-system handover, if the target NG-RAN node accepts the
downlink data forwarding for at least one QoS flow for which the *DL
Forwarding* IE is set to \"DL forwarding proposed\", it may include the
*DL Forwarding UP TNL Information IE in the Handover Request Acknowledge
Transfer* IE as forwarding tunnel for the QoS flows listed in the *QoS
Flow Setup Response List* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message.

In case of intra-system handover, if the target NG-RAN node accepts the
uplink data forwarding for at least one QoS flow for which the *UL
Forwarding* IE is set to \"UL forwarding proposed\", it may include the
*UL Forwarding UP TNL Information IE in the Handover Request Acknowledge
Transfer* IE for the PDU session within the *PDU Session Resource
Admitted List* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.

In case of intra-system handover, for each PDU session for which the
*Additional DL UP TNL Information for HO List* IE is included in the
*Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message, the SMF shall consider the included *Additional DL
NG-U UP TNL Information* IE as the downlink termination point for the
associated flows indicated in the *Additional QoS Flow Setup Response
List* IE for this PDU session split in different tunnels and shall
consider the *Additional DL Forwarding UP TNL Information* IE, if
included, as the forwarding tunnel associated to these QoS flows.

In case of intra-system handover, for each PDU session for which the
*Additional UL Forwarding UP TNL Information* IE is included in the
*Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message, the SMF shall consider it as the termination points
for the uplink forwarding tunnels for this PDU session split in
different tunnels.

In case of intra-system handover, if the target NG-RAN node accepts the
data forwarding for a successfully configured DRB, the target NG-RAN
node may include the *DL Forwarding UP TNL Information* IE for the DRB
within the *Data Forwarding Response DRB List* IE *within Handover
Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message.

In case of intra-system handover, if the target NG-RAN node receives the
*Direct Forwarding Path Availability* IE set to \"direct path
available\" within the *PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE,
the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, assign the UP transport
layer information for intra-system direct data forwarding from the
appropriate address space, if applicable.

If the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the *UL Forwarding
UP TNL Information* IE for a given DRB in the *Data Forwarding Response
DRB List IE within the Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE*,* it
indicates the target NG-RAN node has requested the forwarding of uplink
data for the DRB.

In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN, if the *PDU Session
Resource Setup Request Transfer* IE contains the *Direct Forwarding Path
Availability* IE set to \"direct path available\", the target NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, and if it accepts downlink data forwarding for
the QoS flows mapped to an E-RAB of an admitted PDU session, include the
*DL Forwarding UP TNL Information IE in the Data Forwarding Response
E-RAB List* IE *in the Handover Request Acknowledge Transfer* IE *in the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message* for that mapped E-RAB.

In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN, the target NG-RAN node
includes the *Data Forwarding Accepted* IE for each QoS flow that the
*DL Forwarding* IE is set to \"DL forwarding proposed\" for the
corresponding E-RAB in the *Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node
Transparent Container* IE and that the target NG-RAN node has admitted
the proposed forwarding of downlink data for the QoS flow. If indirect
data forwarding is applied for inter-system handover, if the target
NG-RAN node accepts the downlink data forwarding for at least one QoS
flow of an admitted PDU session it shall include the *DL Forwarding UP
TNL Information IE in the PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer*
IE for that PDU session within the *PDU Session Resources Admitted List*
IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.

In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN with direct forwarding, if
the target NG-RAN node receives the *SgNB UE X2AP ID* IE in the *Source
NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container* IE, it may use
it for internal forwarding as described in TS 37.340 \[32\].

In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN, if the target cell is a
CAG cell, the target NG-RAN node shall include the *NPN Access
Information* IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, and the AMF
shall consider that the included information is associated to the target
cell and to the UE's serving PLMN Identity, and use it as specified in
TS 23.501 \[9\].

The target NG-RAN node shall use the information in the *Mobility
Restriction List* IE if present in the HANDOVER REQUEST message to

### 8.6.2 Downlink NAS Transport

#### 8.6.2.1 General

The Downlink NAS Transport procedure is used when the AMF only needs to
send a NAS message transparently via the NG-RAN node to the UE, and a
UE-associated logical NG-connection exists for the UE or the AMF has
received the *RAN UE NGAP ID* IE in an INITIAL UE MESSAGE message or if
the NG-RAN node has already initiated a UE-associated logical
NG-connection by sending an INITIAL UE MESSAGE message via another NG
interface instance.

#### 8.6.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.2.2-1: Downlink NAS transport

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message to the NG-RAN node. If the UE-associated logical NG-connection
is not established, the AMF shall allocate a unique **AMF UE NGAP ID**
to be used for the UE and include that in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message; *by receiving the **AMF UE NGAP ID*** IE in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node establishes the UE-associated logical
NG-connection.

If the *RAN Paging Priority* IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a priority
for paging the UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

The *NAS-PDU* IE contains an AMF -- UE message that is transferred
without interpretation in the NG-RAN node.

If the *Mobility Restriction List* IE is contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite any previously stored
mobility restriction information in the UE context. The NG-RAN node
shall use the information in the *Mobility Restriction List* IE if
present in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message to:

\- determine a target for subsequent mobility action for which the
NG-RAN node provides information about the target of the mobility action
towards the UE;

\- assign proper RNA(s) for the UE when moving the UE to RRC\_INACTIVE
state.

If the *Mobility Restriction List* IE is not contained in the DOWNLINK
NAS TRANSPORT message and there is no previously stored mobility
restriction information, the NG-RAN node shall consider that no roaming
and no access restriction apply to the UE except for the PNI NPN
mobility as described in TS 23.501 \[9\].

The NG-RAN node shall consider that roaming or access to CAG cells is
only allowed if the *Allowed PNI-NPN List* IE is contained in the

ID* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it as specified in TS
23.501 \[9\] and TS 23.502 \[10\].

If the *Target NSSAI Information* IE is contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node may use this information as specified
in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *Partially Allowed NSSAI* IE is contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, deduce from it
the partially allowed network slices for the UE, store and replace any
previously received Partially Allowed NSSAI and use it as specified in
TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *Masked IMEISV* IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it to determine the
characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.

If the *Mobile* *IAB Authorized* IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store the
received Mobile IAB Authorization status in the UE context. If the
*Mobile* *IAB Authorized* IE is set to \"not authorized\" for a mobile
IAB-MT, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, ensure that the mobile IAB
node will not serve any UE(s).

**Interactions with Initial UE Message procedure:**

The NG-RAN node shall use the *AMF UE NGAP ID* IE and *RAN UE NGAP ID*
IE received in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message as identification of
the logical connection even if the *RAN UE NGAP ID* IE had been
allocated in an INITIAL UE MESSAGE message sent over a different NG
interface instance.

**Interaction with the UE Radio Capability Info Indication procedure:**

**If the *UE Capability Info Request* IE set to** \"**requested**\" **is
included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall
trigger the UE Radio Capability Info Indication procedure if UE
capability related information was successfully retrieved from the UE.**

#### 8.6.2.3 Abnormal Conditions

IE is also present in the *Allowed NSSAI* IE, the NG-RAN node shall
consider the procedure as failed.

### 8.6.3 Uplink NAS Transport

#### 8.6.3.1 General

The Uplink NAS Transport procedure is used when the NG-RAN node has
received from the radio interface a NAS message to be forwarded to the
AMF to which a UE-associated logical NG-connection for the UE exists.

#### 8.6.3.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.3.2-1: Uplink NAS transport

The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending an UPLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message to the AMF.

The *NAS-PDU* IE contains a UE -- AMF message that is transferred
without interpretation in the NG-RAN node.

#### 8.6.3.3 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.6.4 NAS Non Delivery Indication

#### 8.6.4.1 General

The NAS Non Delivery Indication procedure is used when the NG-RAN node
decides not to start the delivery of a NAS message that has been
received over a UE-associated logical NG-connection or the NG-RAN node
is unable to ensure that the message has been received by the UE.

#### 8.6.4.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.4.2-1: NAS non delivery indication

The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending a NAS NON DELIVERY
INDICATION message to the AMF. The NG-RAN node shall report the
non-delivery of a NAS message by including the non-delivered NAS message
within the *NAS-PDU* IE and an appropriate cause value within the
*Cause* IE, e.g., \"NG intra system handover triggered\", \"NG inter
system handover triggered\" or \"Xn handover triggered\".

#### 8.6.4.3 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.6.5 Reroute NAS Request

#### 8.6.5.1 General

The purpose of the Reroute NAS Request procedure is to enable the AMF to
request for a rerouting of the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message to another
AMF.

#### 8.6.5.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.6.5.2-1: Reroute NAS request

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a REROUTE NAS REQUEST message
to the NG-RAN node. The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, reroute the
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message to an AMF indicated by the *AMF Set ID* IE as
described in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *Allowed NSSAI* IE is included in the REROUTE NAS REQUEST
message, then the NG-RAN node shall propagate it in the rerouted INITIAL
UE MESSAGE message as defined in TS 23.502 \[10\].

If the *Partially Allowed NSSAI* IE is contained in the REROUTE NAS
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, propagate it in
the rerouted INITIAL UE MESSAGE message as defined in TS 23.502 \[10\].

If the *Source to Target AMF Information Reroute* IE is included in the
REROUTE NAS REQUEST message, then the NG-RAN node shall propagate it in
the rerouted INITIAL UE MESSAGE message as defined in TS 23.502 \[10\].

#### 8.6.5.3 Abnormal Conditions

8.7 Interface Management Procedures
-----------------------------------

### 8.7.1 NG Setup

#### 8.7.1.1 General

The purpose of the NG Setup procedure is to exchange application level
data needed for the NG-RAN node and the AMF to correctly interoperate on
the NG-C interface. This procedure shall be the first NGAP procedure
triggered after the TNL association has become operational. The
procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data
in the two nodes, replaces it by the one received and clears AMF
overload state information at the NG-RAN node. If the NG-RAN node and
AMF do not agree on retaining the UE contexts this procedure also
re-initialises the NGAP UE-related contexts (if any) and erases all
related signalling connections in the two nodes like an NG Reset
procedure would do.

#### 8.7.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.1.2-1: NG setup: successful operation

The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending an NG SETUP REQUEST
message including the appropriate data to the AMF. The AMF responds with
an NG SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.

If the *Configured TAC Indication* IE set to \"true" is included for a
Tracking Area contained in the *Supported TA List* IE in the NG SETUP
REQUEST message, the AMF may take it into account to optimise NG-C
signalling towards this NG-RAN node.

If the *UE Retention Information* IE set to "ues-retained" is included
in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF may accept the proposal to
retain the existing UE related contexts and signalling connections by
including the *UE Retention Information* IE set to "ues-retained" in the
NG SETUP RESPONSE message.

If the AMF supports IAB, the AMF shall include the *IAB Supported* IE in
the NG SETUP RESPONSE message. If the *IAB Supported* IE is included in
the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
store this information and use it for further AMF selection for the
IAB-MT.

The AMF shall include the *Backup AMF Name* IE, if available, in the
*Served GUAMI List* IE in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message. The NG-RAN node
shall, if supported, consider the AMF as indicated by the *Backup AMF
Name* IE when performing AMF reselection, as specified in TS 23.501
\[9\]. If the *Extended Backup AMF Name* IE is included in the *Served
GUAMI List* IE in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN node shall,
if supported, consider the AMF as indicated by the *Extended Backup AMF
Name* IE when performing AMF reselection, as specified in TS 23.501
\[9\].

If the *GUAMI Type* IE is included in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the
NG-RAN node shall store the received value and use it for further AMF
selection as defined in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *RAN Node Name* IE is included in the NG SETUP REQUEST message,
the AMF may use this IE as a human readable name of the NG-RAN node. If
the *Extended RAN Node Name* IE is included in the NG SETUP REQUEST
message, the AMF may use this IE as a human readable name of the NG-RAN
node and shall ignore the *RAN Node Name* IE if also included.

If the *Extended AMF Name* IE is included in the NG SETUP RESPONSE
message, the NG-RAN node may use this IE as a human readable name of the
AMF and shall ignore the *AMF Name* IE.

If the *NB-IoT Default Paging DRX* IE is included in the NG SETUP
REQUEST message, the AMF shall take it into account for paging.

If the *RAT Information* IE is included in the NG SETUP REQUEST message,
the AMF shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502 \[10\].

If the *NID* IE within the *NPN Support* IE is included within a
*Broadcast PLMN Item* IE in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF shall
consider that the NG-RAN node supports the indicated S-NSSAI(s) for the
corresponding tracking area code for the SNPN identified by the *PLMN
Identity* IE and the *NID* IE.

If the *NID* IE within the *NPN Support* IE is included within a *PLMN
Support Item* IE in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN node shall
consider that the AMF supports the SNPN identified by the *PLMN
Identity* IE and the *NID* IE.

If the *Onboarding Support* IE is also included within the same *PLMN
Support Item* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, consider that the
AMF supports UE onboarding for the identified SNPN, as specified in TS
23.501 \[9\].

If the *TAI NSAG Support List* IE is included in the *Broadcast PLMN
Item* IE in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF shall, if supported,
use this information as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the AMF supports mobile IAB, the AMF shall include the *Mobile IAB
Supported* IE in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message. If the *Mobile IAB
Supported* IE is included in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN
node shall, if supported, store this information and further use it for
AMF selection for the mobile IAB-MT.

#### 8.7.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.7.1.3-1: NG setup: unsuccessful operation

If the AMF cannot accept the setup, it should respond with an NG SETUP
FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.

If the NG SETUP FAILURE message includes the *Time to Wait* IE, the
NG-RAN node shall wait at least for the indicated time before
reinitiating the NG Setup procedure towards the same AMF.

#### 8.7.1.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the AMF does not identify any of the PLMNs/SNPNs indicated in the NG
SETUP REQUEST message, it shall reject the NG Setup procedure with an
appropriate cause value.

If none of the RATs indicated by the NG-RAN node in the NG SETUP REQUEST
message is supported by the AMF, then the AMF shall fail the NG Setup
procedure with an appropriate cause value.

### 8.7.2 RAN Configuration Update

#### 8.7.2.1 General

The purpose of the RAN Configuration Update procedure is to update
application level configuration data needed for the NG-RAN node and the
AMF to interoperate correctly on the NG-C interface. This procedure does
not affect existing UE-related contexts, if any. The procedure uses non
UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.7.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.2.2-1: RAN configuration update: successful operation

The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending a RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message to the AMF including an appropriate set of updated
configuration data that it has just taken into operational use. The AMF
responds with a RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to
acknowledge that it successfully updated the configuration data. If an
information element is not included in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the AMF shall interpret that the corresponding configuration
data is not changed and shall continue to operate the NG-C interface
with the existing related configuration data.

If the *Supported TA List* IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the AMF shall overwrite the whole list of supported TAs
and the corresponding list of supported slices for each TA, and use them
for subsequent registration area management of the UE.

If the *Configured TAC Indication* IE set to \"true" is included for a
Tracking Area contained in the *Supported TA List* IE in the RAN
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the AMF may take it into account to
optimise NG-C signalling towards this NG-RAN node.

If the *Global RAN Node ID* IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the AMF shall associate the TNLA to the NG-C interface
instance using the Global RAN Node ID.

If the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the *NG-RAN TNL
Association to Remove List* IE, the AMF shall, if supported, initiate
removal of the TNL association(s) indicated by NG-RAN TNL endpoint(s)
and AMF TNL endpoint(s) if the *TNL Association Transport Layer Address
at AMF* IE is present, or the TNL association(s) indicated by NG-RAN TNL
endpoint(s) if the *TNL Association Transport Layer Address at AMF* IE
is absent:

\- if the received *TNL Association Transport Layer Address* IE includes
the *Port Number* IE, the NG-RAN TNL endpoint is identified by the
*Endpoint IP Address* IE and the *Port Number* IE. Otherwise, the NG-RAN
TNL endpoints correspond to all NG-RAN TNL endpoints identified by the
*Endpoint IP Address* IE and any port number(s).

\- if the received *TNL Association Transport Layer Address at AMF* IE
includes the *Port Number* IE, the AMF TNL endpoint is identified by the
*Endpoint IP Address* IE and the *Port Number* IE. Otherwise, the AMF
TNL endpoints correspond to all AMF TNL endpoints identified by the
*Endpoint IP Address* IE and any port number(s).

If the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the *RAN Node Name* IE,
the AMF may store it or update this IE value if already stored, and use
it as a human readable name of the NG-RAN node. If the RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message includes the *Extended RAN Node Name* IE, the AMF may
store it or update this IE value if already stored, and use it as a
human readable name of the NG-RAN node and shall ignore the *RAN Node
Name* IE if also included.

If the *NB-IoT Default Paging DRX* IE is included in the RAN
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the AMF shall overwrite any previously
stored NB-IoT default paging DRX value for the NG-RAN node.

If the *RAT Information* IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the AMF shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502
\[10\].

If the *NID* IE within the *NPN Support* IE is included within a
*Broadcast PLMN Item* IE in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the
AMF shall consider that the NG-RAN node supports the indicated
S-NSSAI(s) for the corresponding tracking area code for the SNPN
identified by the *PLMN Identity* IE and the *NID* IE.

If the *TAI NSAG Support List* IE is included in the *Broadcast PLMN
Item* IE in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the AMF shall, if
supported, use this information as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

#### 8.7.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.7.2.3-1: RAN configuration update: unsuccessful operation

If the AMF cannot accept the update, it shall respond with a RAN
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.

If the *Time to Wait* IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
FAILURE message, the NG-RAN node shall wait at least for the indicated
time before reinitiating the RAN Configuration Update procedure towards
the same AMF.

#### 8.7.2.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the NG-RAN node, after initiating the RAN Configuration Update
procedure, receives neither a RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor a
RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the NG-RAN node may reinitiate
a further RAN Configuration Update procedure towards the same AMF,
provided that the content of the new RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is
identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged RAN
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.

### 8.7.3 AMF Configuration Update

#### 8.7.3.1 General

The purpose of the AMF Configuration Update procedure is to update
application level configuration data needed for the NG-RAN node and AMF
to interoperate correctly on the NG-C interface. This procedure does not
affect existing UE-related contexts, if any. The procedure uses non
UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.7.3.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.3.2-1: AMF configuration update: successful operation

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending an AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message including the appropriate updated configuration data to the
NG-RAN node. The NG-RAN node responds with an AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it successfully updated the
configuration data. Unless stated otherwise, if an information element
is not included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node
shall interpret that the corresponding configuration data is not changed
and shall continue to operate the NG-C interface with the existing
related configuration data.

If the *PLMN Support List* IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite the whole list of
supported PLMN/SNPN Identities and the corresponding list of AMF slices
and, if present, other associated information for each PLMN/SNPN
Identity and use the received values for further network slice selection
and AMF selection.

If the *AMF TNL Association to Add List* IE is included in the AMF
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use
it to establish the TNL association(s) with the AMF. If the *AMF TNL
Association to Add List* IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, and if the *AMF TNL Association Address* IE does not include
the *Port Number* IE, the NG-RAN node shall assume that port number
value 38412 is used for the endpoint. The NG-RAN node shall report to
the AMF, in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message, the
successful establishment of the TNL association(s) with the AMF as
follows:

\- A list of successfully established TNL associations shall be included
in the *AMF TNL Association Setup List* IE;

\- A list of TNL associations that failed to be established shall be
included in the *AMF TNL Association Failed to Setup List* IE.

If the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the *AMF TNL
Association to Remove List* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
initiate removal of the TNL association(s) indicated by AMF TNL
endpoint(s) and NG-RAN node TNL endpoint(s) if the *TNL Association
Transport Layer Address NG-RAN* IE is present, or the TNL association(s)
indicated by AMF TNL endpoint(s) if the *TNL Association Transport Layer
Address NG-RAN IE* is absent:

\- if the received *AMF TNL Association Address* IE includes the *Port
Number* IE, the AMF TNL endpoint is identified by the *Endpoint IP
Address* IE and the *Port Number* IE. Otherwise, the AMF TNL endpoints
correspond to all AMF TNL endpoints identified by the *Endpoint IP
Address* IE and any port number(s).

\- if the received *TNL Association Transport Layer Address NG-RAN* IE
includes the *Port Number* IE, the NG-RAN node TNL endpoint is
identified by the *Endpoint IP Address* IE and the *Port Number* IE.
Otherwise, the NG-RAN node TNL endpoints correspond to all NG-RAN node
TNL endpoints identified by the *Endpoint IP Address* IE and any port
number(s).

If the *AMF Name* IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite the previously stored AMF name
and use it to identify the AMF.

If the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the *AMF Name* IE, the
NG-RAN node may store it or update this IE value if already stored, and
use it as a human readable name of the AMF. If the AMF CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message includes the *Extended AMF Name* IE, the NG-RAN node may
store it or update this IE value if already stored, and use it as a
human readable name of the AMF and shall ignore the *AMF Name* IE if
also included.

If the *Served GUAMI List* IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite the whole list of GUAMIs
served by the AMF by the new list and use the received values for
further AMF management and AMF selection as defined in TS 23.501 \[9\].

If the *Relative AMF Capacity* IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node may use it as defined in TS 23.501
\[9\].

If the *AMF TNL Association to Update List* IE is included in the AMF
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, update
the TNL association(s) indicated by the received AMF Transport Layer
information towards the AMF:

\- if the received *AMF TNL Association Address* IE includes the *Port
Number* IE, the AMF TNL endpoint is identified by the *Endpoint IP
Address* IE and the *Port Number* IE. Otherwise, the AMF TNL endpoints
correspond to all AMF TNL endpoints identified by the *Endpoint IP
Address* IE and any port number(s).

If the *TNL Association Usage* IE or the *TNL Address Weight Factor* IE
is included in the *AMF TNL Association to Add List* IE or the *AMF TNL
Association to Update List* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
consider it as defined in TS 23.502 \[10\].

If the *NID* IE within the *NPN Support* IE is included within a *PLMN
Support Item* IE in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the NG-RAN
node shall consider that the AMF supports the SNPN identified by the
*PLMN Identity* IE and the *NID* IE.

If the *Onboarding Support* IE is also included within the same *PLMN
Support Item* IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, consider that the
AMF supports UE onboarding for the identified SNPN, as specified in TS
23.501 \[9\].

#### 8.7.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.7.3.3-1: AMF configuration update: unsuccessful operation

If the NG-RAN node cannot accept the update, it shall respond with an
AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.

If the *Time to Wait* IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
FAILURE message, the AMF shall wait at least for the indicated time
before reinitiating the AMF Configuration Update procedure towards the
same NG-RAN node.

#### 8.7.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the AMF receives neither an AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor
an AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the AMF may reinitiate the
AMF Configuration Update procedure towards the same NG-RAN node provided
that the content of the new AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is
identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged AMF
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.

### 8.7.4 NG Reset

#### 8.7.4.1 General

The purpose of the NG Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise
the RAN, or part of RAN NGAP UE-related contexts, in the event of a
failure in the 5GC or vice versa. This procedure does not affect the
application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the NG
Setup procedure. The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

#### 8.7.4.2 Successful Operation

##### 8.7.4.2.1 NG Reset initiated by the AMF

Figure 8.7.4.2.1-1: NG reset initiated by the AMF: successful operation

In the event of a failure at the AMF which has resulted in the loss of
some or all transaction reference information, an NG RESET message shall
be sent to the NG-RAN node.

At reception of the NG RESET message the NG-RAN node shall release all
allocated resources on NG and Uu related to the UE association(s)
indicated explicitly or implicitly in the NG RESET message and remove
the indicated UE contexts including NGAP ID.

After the NG-RAN node has released all assigned NG resources and the UE
NGAP IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new
UE-associated logical NG-connections over the NG interface, the NG-RAN
node shall respond with the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The NG-RAN
node does not need to wait for the release of radio resources to be
completed before returning the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

*If the NG RESET message contains the UE-associated Logical
NG-connection List IE, then:*

*- The NG-RAN node shall use the AMF UE NGAP ID* IE and/or the *RAN UE
NGAP ID* IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

\- The NG-RAN node shall include in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message,
for each UE association to be reset, the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item* IE in the *UE-associated Logical NG-connection List*
IE. The *UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item* IEs shall be in the
same order as received in the NG RESET message and shall include also
unknown UE-associated logical NG-connections. Empty *UE-associated
Logical NG-connection Item* IEs, received in the NG RESET message, may
be omitted in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *AMF UE NGAP ID* IE is included in the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the NG-RAN node shall
include the *AMF UE NGAP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated
Logical NG-connection Item* IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the ***RAN UE NGAP ID*** IE is included in the *UE-associated
Logical NG-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the NG-RAN node
shall include the *RAN UE NGAP ID* IE in the corresponding
*UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item* IE in the NG RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message.

**Interactions with other procedures:**

If the NG RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
for another NG Reset procedure) on the same NG interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the NG RESET message,
shall be aborted.

##### 8.7.4.2.2 NG Reset initiated by the NG-RAN node

Figure 8.7.4.2.2-1: NG reset initiated by the NG-RAN node: successful
operation

In the event of a failure at the NG-RAN node which has resulted in the
loss of some or all transaction reference information, an NG RESET
message shall be sent to the AMF.

At reception of the NG RESET message the AMF shall release all allocated
resources on NG related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or
implicitly in the NG RESET message and remove the NGAP ID for the
indicated UE associations.

After the AMF has released all assigned NG resources and the UE NGAP IDs
for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new
UE-associated logical NG-connections over the NG interface, the AMF
shall respond with the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

*If the NG RESET message contains the UE-associated Logical
NG-connection List IE, then:*

*- The AMF shall use the AMF UE NGAP ID* IE and/or the *RAN UE NGAP ID*
IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

\- The AMF shall include in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each
UE association to be reset, the *UE-associated Logical NG-connection
Item* IE in the *UE-associated Logical NG-connection List* IE. The
*UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item* IEs shall be in the same
order as received in the NG RESET message and shall include also unknown
UE-associated logical NG-connections. Empty *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item* IEs, received in the NG RESET message, may be
omitted in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *AMF UE NGAP ID* IE is included in the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the AMF shall include the
*AMF UE NGAP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item* IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the ***RAN UE NGAP ID*** IE is included in a *UE-associated
Logical NG-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the AMF shall
include the *RAN UE NGAP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated
Logical NG-connection Item* IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

**Interactions with other procedures:**

If the NG RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
for another NG Reset procedure) on the same NG interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the NG RESET message,
shall be aborted.

#### 8.7.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.7.4.4 Abnormal Conditions

##### 8.7.4.4.1 Abnormal Condition at the 5GC

If the NG RESET message includes the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection List IE, but* neither the *AMF UE NGAP ID* IE nor the *RAN
UE NGAP ID* IE is present for a *UE-associated Logical NG-connection
Item* IE, then the AMF shall ignore the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item* IE. The AMF may return the empty *UE-associated
Logical NG-connection Item* IE in the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection List IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.*

##### 8.7.4.4.2 Abnormal Condition at the NG-RAN

If the NG RESET message includes the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection List IE, but* neither the *AMF UE NGAP ID* IE nor the *RAN
UE NGAP ID* IE is present for a *UE-associated Logical NG-connection
Item* IE, then the NG-RAN node shall ignore the *UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item* IE. The NG-RAN node may return the empty
*UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item* IE in the *UE-associated
Logical NG-connection List IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.*

##### 8.7.4.4.3 Crossing of NG RESET Messages

If an NG Reset procedure is ongoing in the NG-RAN node and the NG-RAN
node receives an NG RESET message from the peer entity on the same NG
interface related to one or several UE associations previously requested
to be reset, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the received NG RESET
message, the NG-RAN node shall respond with the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
message as described in 8.7.4.2.1.

If an NG Reset procedure is ongoing in the AMF and the AMF receives an
NG RESET message from the peer entity on the same NG interface related
to one or several UE associations previously requested to be reset,
indicated explicitly or implicitly in the received NG RESET message, the
AMF shall respond with the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in
8.7.4.2.2.

### 8.7.5 Error Indication

#### 8.7.5.1 General

The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report
detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be
reported by an appropriate failure message.

If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising
UE-associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses
UE-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated
signalling.

#### 8.7.5.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.5.2-1: Error indication initiated by the AMF

Figure 8.7.5.2-2: Error indication initiated by the NG-RAN node

When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error
Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent
from the receiving node.

The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the *Cause*
IE or the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE. In case the Error Indication
procedure is triggered by utilising UE-associated signalling the *AMF UE
NGAP ID* IE and the *RAN UE NGAP ID* IE shall be included in the ERROR
INDICATION message. If one or both of the *AMF UE NGAP ID* IE and the
*RAN UE NGAP ID* IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to an
appropriate value, e.g., \"Unknown local UE NGAP ID\" or \"Inconsistent
remote UE NGAP ID\".

#### 8.7.5.3 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.7.6 AMF Status Indication

#### 8.7.6.1 General

The purpose of the AMF Status Indication procedure is to support AMF
management functions. The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.7.6.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.6.2-1: AMF status indication

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending an AMF STATUS INDICATION
message to the NG-RAN node.

Upon receipt of the AMF STATUS INDICATION message, the NG-RAN node shall
consider the indicated GUAMI(s) will be unavailable and perform AMF
reselection as defined in TS 23.501 \[9\].

The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, act accordingly as specified in TS
23.501 \[9\], based on the presence or absence of the *Timer Approach
for GUAMI Removal* IE.

If the *Backup AMF Name* IE is included in the AMF STATUS INDICATION
message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, perform AMF reselection
considering the AMF as indicated by the *Backup AMF Name* IE as
specified in TS 23.501 \[9\]. If the *Extended* *Backup AMF Name* IE is
included in the AMF STATUS INDICATION message, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, perform AMF reselection considering the AMF as indicated by
the *Extended* *Backup AMF Name* IE as specified in TS 23.501 \[9\].

#### 8.7.6.3 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.7.7 Overload Start

#### 8.7.7.1 General

The purpose of the Overload Start procedure is to inform an NG-RAN node
to reduce the signalling load towards the concerned AMF. The procedure
uses non-UE associated signalling.

#### 8.7.7.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.7.2-1: Overload start

The NG-RAN node receiving the OVERLOAD START message shall assume the
AMF from which it receives the message as being in an overloaded state.

If the *Overload Action* IE is included the *AMF* *Overload Response* IE
within the OVERLOAD START message, the NG-RAN node shall use it to
identify the related signalling traffic. When the *Overload Action* IE
is set to

\- \"reject RRC connection establishments for non-emergency mobile
originated data transfer\" (i.e., reject traffic corresponding to RRC
cause \"mo-data\", \"mo-SMS\", \"mo-VideoCall\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in
TS 38.331 \[18\] or \"mo-data\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in TS 36.331
\[21\]), or

\- \"reject RRC connection establishments for signalling\" (i.e., reject
traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"mo-data\", \"mo-SMS\",
\"mo-signalling\", \"mo-VideoCall\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in TS 38.331
\[18\] or \"mo-data\", \"mo-signalling\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in TS
36.331 \[21\]), or

\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for emergency sessions
and mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit traffic
corresponding to RRC cause \"emergency\" and \"mt-Access\" in TS 38.331
\[18\] or in TS 36.331 \[21\]), or

\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for high priority
sessions and mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit traffic
corresponding to RRC cause \"highPriorityAccess\",
\"mps-PriorityAccess\", \"mcs-PriorityAccess\" and \"mt-Access\" in TS
38.331 \[18\] or \"highPriorityAccess\", \"mo-ExceptionData\" and
\"mt-Access\" in TS 36.331 \[21\]),

the NG-RAN node shall:

\- if the *AMF Traffic Load Reduction Indication* IE is included in the
OVERLOAD START message, reduce the signalling traffic by the indicated
percentage,

\- otherwise ensure that only the signalling traffic not indicated as to
be rejected is sent to the AMF.

If the *Overload Start NSSAI List* IE is included in the OVERLOAD START
message, the NG-RAN node shall:

\- if the *Slice Traffic Load Reduction Indication* IE is present,
reduce the signalling traffic by the indicated percentage for the UE(s)
whose requested NSSAI only include S-NSSAI(s) contained in the *Overload
Start NSSAI List* IE, and the signalling traffic indicated as to be
reduced by the *Overload Action* IE in the *Slice Overload Response* IE
if the IE is present,

\- otherwise ensure that only the signalling traffic from UE(s) whose
requested NSSAI includes S-NSSAI(s) other than the ones contained in the
*Overload Start NSSAI List* IE, or the signalling traffic not indicated
as to be reduced by the *Overload Action* IE in the *Slice Overload
Response* IE for the UE(s) if the requested NSSAI matched, is sent to
the AMF.

If an overload control is ongoing and the NG-RAN node receives a further
OVERLOAD START message, the NG-RAN node shall replace the contents of
the previously received information with the new one.

#### 8.7.7.3 Abnormal Conditions

### 8.7.8 Overload Stop

#### 8.7.8.1 General

The purpose of the Overload Stop procedure is to signal to an NG-RAN
node the AMF is connected to that the overload situation at the AMF has
ended and normal operation shall resume. The procedure uses non-UE
associated signalling.

#### 8.7.8.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.8.2-1: Overload stop

The NG-RAN node receiving the OVERLOAD STOP message shall assume that
the overload situation at the AMF from which it receives the message has
ended and shall resume normal operation for the applicable traffic
towards this AMF.

#### 8.7.8.3 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

8.8 Configuration Transfer Procedures
-------------------------------------

### 8.8.1 Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer

#### 8.8.1.1 General

The purpose of the Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer procedure is to
transfer RAN configuration information from the NG-RAN node to the AMF.
The AMF does not interpret the transferred RAN configuration
information. This procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

#### 8.8.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.8.1.2-1: Uplink RAN configuration transfer

The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending the UPLINK RAN
CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to the AMF.

If the AMF receives the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE, it shall
transparently transfer the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE towards the
NG-RAN node indicated in the *Target RAN Node ID* IE which is included
in the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE. If the *NR CGI* IE is included
within the *Target RAN Node ID* IE, the AMF shall, if supported, ignore
the *Global RAN Node ID* IE within the *Target RAN Node ID* IE, and use
it to identify the target gNB as described in TS 38.300 \[8\].

If the AMF receives the *EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer* IE, it shall
transparently transfer the *EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer* IE towards
an MME serving the eNB indicated in the *Target eNB-ID* IE which is
included in the *EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer* IE.

If the AMF receives the *Inter-system SON Configuration Transfer* IE, it
shall transparently transfer the *Inter-system SON Configuration
Transfer* IE towards an MME serving the eNB indicated in the *Target
eNB-ID* IE which is included in the *Inter-system SON Configuration
Transfer* IE.

#### 8.8.1.3 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.8.2 Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer

#### 8.8.2.1 General

The purpose of the Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer procedure is to
transfer RAN configuration information from the AMF to the NG-RAN node.
This procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

#### 8.8.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.8.2.2-1: Downlink RAN configuration transfer

The procedure is initiated with an DOWNLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER
message sent from the AMF to the NG-RAN node.

If the NG-RAN node receives, in the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE or
in the *EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer* IE, the *SON Information* IE
containing the *SON Information Request* IE, it may transfer back the
requested information either towards the NG-RAN node indicated in the
*Source RAN Node ID* IE of the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE or
towards an eNB indicated in the *Source eNB-ID* IE of the *EN-DC SON
Configuration Transfer* IE by initiating the Uplink RAN Configuration
Transfer procedure.

If the NG-RAN node receives, in the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE, the
*Xn TNL Configuration Info* IE containing the *Xn Extended Transport
Layer Addresses* IE, it may use it as part of its ACL functionality
configuration actions, if such ACL functionality is deployed.

If the NG-RAN node receives, in the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE, the
*SON Information* IE containing the *SON Information Reply* IE including
the *Xn TNL Configuration Info* IE as an answer to a former request, it
may use it to initiate the Xn TNL establishment.

In case the *IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE is present and the *GTP
Transport Layer Addresses* IE within the *Xn Extended Transport Layer
Addresses* IE is not empty, GTP traffic is conveyed within an IP-Sec
tunnel terminated at the IP-Sec tunnel endpoint given in the *IP-Sec
Transport Layer Address* IE.

In case the *IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE is not present, GTP
traffic is terminated at the endpoints given by the list of addresses in
the *Xn* *GTP Transport Layer Addresses* IE within the *Xn Extended
Transport Layer Addresses* IE.

In case the *Xn* *GTP Transport Layer Addresses* IE is empty and the
*IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE is present, SCTP traffic is conveyed
within an IP-Sec tunnel terminated at the IP-Sec tunnel endpoint given
in the *IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE, within the *Xn Extended
Transport Layer Addresses* IE.

In case the *Xn SCTP Transport Layer Addresses* IE is present and the
*IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE is also present, the concerned SCTP
traffic is conveyed within an IP-Sec tunnel terminated at the IP-Sec
tunnel endpoint given in this *IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE,
within the *Xn Extended Transport Layer Addresses* IE.

If the NG-RAN node receives the *SON Information* IE containing the *SON
Information Report* IE it may use it as specified in TS 38.300 \[8\].

If the NG-RAN node receives the *Inter-system* *SON Information* IE
containing the *Inter-system SON Information Report* IE it may use it as
specified in TS 38.300 \[8\].

If the NG-RAN node receives the *Inter-system* *SON Information* IE
containing the *Inter-system SON Information Request* IE or the
*Inter-system SON Information Reply* IE, it may use it as specified in
TS 38.300 \[8\]. If the *Reporting System* IE in the *Inter-system SON
Information Request* IE is set to \"No Reporting\", the DOWNLINK RAN
CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message shall be ignored.

If the NG-RAN node is configured to use one IPsec tunnel for all NG and
Xn traffic (IPsec star topology) then the traffic to the peer NG-RAN
node shall be routed through this IPsec tunnel and the *IP-Sec Transport
Layer Address* IE shall be ignored.

Void.

8.9 Warning Message Transmission Procedures
-------------------------------------------

### 8.9.1 Write-Replace Warning

#### 8.9.1.1 General

The purpose of Write-Replace Warning procedure is to start or overwrite
the broadcasting of warning messages. The procedure uses non
UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.9.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.9.1.2-1: Write-Replace Warning procedure: successful operation

The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message to the NG-RAN node.

Upon receipt of the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message, the NG-RAN
node shall prioritise its resources to process the warning message.

If, in a certain area, broadcast of a warning message is already ongoing
and the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message
with *Message Identifier* IE and/or *Serial Number* IE which are
different from those in the warning message being broadcast, and if the
*Concurrent Warning Message Indicator* IE is not present, the NG-RAN
node shall replace the warning message being broadcast with the newly
received one for that area.

If the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message with
a warning message identified by the *Message Identifier* IE and *Serial
Number* IE and if there are no prior warning messages being broadcast in
any of the warning areas indicated in the *Warning Area List* IE, the
NG-RAN node shall broadcast the received warning message for those
area(s).

If, in a certain area, broadcast of one or more warning messages are
already ongoing and the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message with a *Message Identifier* IE and/or *Serial Number* IE
which are different from those in any of the warning messages being
broadcast, and if the *Concurrent Warning Message Indictor* IE is
present, the NG-RAN node shall schedule the received warning message for
broadcast, for that area.

If the *Concurrent Warning Message Indicator* IE is present and if a
value \"0\" is received in the *Number of Broadcasts Requested* IE, the
NG-RAN node shall broadcast the received warning message indefinitely
until requested otherwise to stop broadcasting, except if the
*Repetition Period* IE is set to \"0\".

If, in a certain area, broadcast of one or more warning messages are
already ongoing and the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message with *Message Identifier* IE and *Serial Number* IE
which correspond to one of the warning messages already being broadcast
in that area, the NG-RAN node shall not start a new broadcast or replace
an existing one but it shall still reply by sending a WRITE-REPLACE
WARNING RESPONSE message which includes the *Broadcast Completed Area
List* IE set according to the ongoing broadcast.

If the *Warning Area* *List* IE is not included in the WRITE-REPLACE
WARNING REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall broadcast the indicated
message in all of the cells within the NG-RAN node.

If the *Warning Type* IE is included in the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall broadcast the Primary

9 Elements for NGAP Communication
=================================

9.0 General
-----------

Subclauses 9.2 and 9.3 present the NGAP message and IE definitions in
tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in
subclause 9.4. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format
and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for
the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional IEs, where
the tabular format shall take precedence.

The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified
in TR 25.921 \[7\].

When specifying IEs which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not
otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the
concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards
to the ordering of bits:

\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit
(LSB);

\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of
the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

9.1 Tabular Format Contents
---------------------------

### 9.1.1 Presence

All IEs are marked mandatory, optional or conditional according to table
9.1.1-1.

Table 9.1.1-1: Meaning of content within \"Presence\" column

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Abbreviation   Meaning
  M              IEs marked as Mandatory (M) shall always be included in the message.
  O              IEs marked as Optional (O) may or may not be included in the message.
  C              IEs marked as Conditional (C) shall be included in a message only if the condition is satisfied. Otherwise the IE shall not be included.
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.1.2 Criticality

Each IE or group of IEs may have criticality information applied to it
according to table 9.1.2-1.

Table 9.1.2-1: Meaning of content within \"Criticality\" column

  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Abbreviation   Meaning
  --             No criticality information is applied explicitly.
  YES            Criticality information is applied. This is usable only for non-repeatable IEs
  GLOBAL         The IE and all its repetitions together have one common criticality information. This is usable only for repeatable IEs.
  EACH           Each repetition of the IE has its own criticality information. It is not allowed to assign different criticality values to the repetitions. This is usable only for repeatable IEs.
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.1.3 Range

The Range column indicates the allowed number of copies of repetitive
IEs/IE groups.

### 9.1.4 Assigned Criticality

The Assigned Criticality column provides the actual criticality
information as defined in subclause 10.3.2, if applicable.

9.2 Message Functional Definition and Content
---------------------------------------------

### 9.2.1 PDU Session Management Messages

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following
tables. In general, \"not supported\" cause values indicate that the
related capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\"
cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but
insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.

  Radio Network Layer cause                                                Meaning
  Unspecified                                                              Sent for radio network layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.
  TXnRELOCOverall expiry                                                   The timer guarding the handover that takes place over Xn has abnormally expired.
  Successful handover                                                      Successful handover.
  Release due to NG-RAN generated reason                                   Release is initiated due to NG-RAN generated reason.
  Release due to 5GC generated reason                                      Release is initiated due to 5GC generated reason.
  Handover cancelled                                                       The reason for the action is cancellation of Handover.
  Partial handover                                                         Provides a reason for the handover cancellation. The HANDOVER COMMAND message from AMF contained *PDU Session Resource to Release List* IE or *QoS flow to Release List* and the source NG-RAN node estimated service continuity for the UE would be better by not proceeding with handover towards this particular target NG-RAN node.
  Handover failure in target 5GC/ NG-RAN node or target system             The handover failed due to a failure in target 5GC/NG-RAN node or target system.
  Handover target not allowed                                              Handover to the indicated target cell is not allowed for the UE in question.
  TNG~RELOCoverall~ expiry                                                 The reason for the action is expiry of timer TNG~RELOCoverall~.
  TNG~RELOCprep~ expiry                                                    Handover Preparation procedure is cancelled when timer TNG~RELOCprep~ expires.
  Cell not available                                                       The concerned cell is not available.
  Unknown target ID                                                        Handover rejected because the target ID is not known to the AMF.
  No radio resources available in target cell                              Load on target cell is too high.
  Unknown local UE NGAP ID                                                 The action failed because the receiving node does not recognise the local UE NGAP ID.
  Inconsistent remote UE NGAP ID                                           The action failed because the receiving node considers that the received remote UE NGAP ID is inconsistent.
  Handover desirable for radio reasons                                     The reason for requesting handover is radio related.
  Time critical handover                                                   Handover is requested for time critical reason i.e., this cause value is reserved to represent all critical cases where the connection is likely to be dropped if handover is not performed.
  Resource optimisation handover                                           The reason for requesting handover is to improve the load distribution with the neighbour cells.
  Reduce load in serving cell                                              Load on serving cell needs to be reduced. When applied to handover preparation, it indicates the handover is triggered due to load balancing.
  User inactivity                                                          The action is requested due to inactivity on all user data radio bearers (i.e., DRBs and, if applicable, MRBs as per section 16.10.5.2 in TS 38.300 \[8\]), e.g., NG is requested to be released in order to optimise the radio resources. For L2 U2N Relay UE, this action is requested due to user inactivity on all PDU sessions of L2 U2N Relay UE and its served remote UE(s).
  Radio connection with UE lost                                            The action is requested due to losing the radio connection to the UE.
  Radio resources not available                                            No requested radio resources are available.

  Failure in the radio interface procedure                                 Radio interface procedure has failed.
  Interaction with other procedure                                         The action is due to an ongoing interaction with another procedure.
  Unknown PDU Session ID                                                   The action failed because the PDU Session ID is unknown in the NG-RAN node.
  Unknown QoS Flow ID                                                      The action failed because the QoS Flow ID is unknown in the NG-RAN node.
  Multiple PDU Session ID instances                                        The action failed because multiple instances of the same PDU Session had been provided to/from the NG-RAN node.
  Multiple QoS Flow ID instances                                           The action failed because multiple instances of the same QoS flow had been provided to the NG-RAN node.

  NG inter-system handover triggered                                       The action is due to a NG inter-system handover that has been triggered.
  Xn handover triggered                                                    The action is due to an Xn handover that has been triggered.
  Not supported 5QI value                                                  The QoS flow setup failed because the requested 5QI is not supported.
  UE context transfer                                                      The action is due to a UE resumes from the NG-RAN node different from the one which sent the UE into RRC\_INACTIVE state.
  IMS voice EPS fallback or RAT fallback triggered                         The setup of QoS flow is failed due to EPS fallback or RAT fallback for IMS voice using handover or redirection.

  UE in RRC\_INACTIVE state not reachable                                  The action is requested due to RAN paging failure.
  Redirection                                                              The release is requested due to inter-system redirection or intra-system redirection.
  Resources not available for the slice(s)                                 The requested resources are not available for the slice(s).
  UE maximum integrity protected data rate reason                          The request is not accepted in order to comply with the maximum data rate for integrity protection supported by the UE.
  Release due to CN-detected mobility                                      The context release is requested by the AMF because the UE is already served by another CN node (same or different system), or another NG interface of the same CN node.
  N26 interface not available                                              The action failed due to a temporary failure of the N26 interface.

  Multiple Location Reporting Reference ID Instances                       The action failed because multiple areas of interest are set with the same Location Reporting Reference ID.
  RSN not available for the UP                                             The redundant user plane resources indicated by RSN are not available.
  NPN access denied                                                        Access was denied, or release is requested, for NPN reasons.
  CAG only access denied                                                   Access was denied because the cell is a non-CAG cell and UE is only allowed to access CAG cells.
  Insufficient UE Capabilities                                             The procedure can't proceed due to insufficient UE capabilities.

#### 9.3.1.30 Target NG-RAN Node to Source NG-RAN Node Transparent Container

This IE is produced by the target NG-RAN node and is transmitted to the
source NG-RAN node. For inter-system handovers to 5G, the IE is
transmitted from the target NG-RAN node to the external relocation
source.

This IE is transparent to the 5GC.

9.4 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.4.1 General

NGAP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 \[4\], ITU-T Rec.
X.680 \[5\] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 \[6\].

The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of NGAP
messages. NGAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set
definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence
being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a
sending entity shall construct an NGAP message according to the PDU
definitions module and with the following additional rules:

\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.

\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE
shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format
there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list
elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container
list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE
container list may contain only one kind of list elements.

NOTE: In the above \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an explicit
ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the
different occurrences will have different IE IDs.

If an NGAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received,
this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall
be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.

### 9.4.2 Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use

The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:

\- for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered
not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality
required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to
guarantee multivendor interoperability;

\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for
standardisation.

The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality.
Such functionality shall be standardised.

9.5 Message Transfer Syntax
---------------------------

NGAP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned
Variant as transfer syntax as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 \[4\].

9.6 Timers
----------

TNG~RELOCprep~

\- Specifies the maximum time for the Handover Preparation procedure in
the source NG-RAN node.

TNG~RELOCoverall~

\- Specifies the maximum time for the protection of the overall handover
procedure in the source NG-RAN node.

\- Specified in TS 38.423 \[24\].

 10 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
==============================================================

10.1 General
------------

Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:

\- Transfer Syntax Error.

\- Abstract Syntax Error.

\- Logical Error.

Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving
node:

Figure 10.1-1: Protocol Errors in NGAP.

The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included
in the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be
included. Other optional information elements within the message may
also be included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the
reporting is done with a response message. The latter is an exception to
what is stated in subclause 4.1.

10.2 Transfer Syntax Error
--------------------------

A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode
the received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always
detected in the process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error
occurs, the receiver should initiate Error Indication procedure with
appropriate cause value for the Transfer Syntax protocol error.

Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:

\- Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. E.g., if
an IE has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and
12 will be received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax
error.

\- Violation in list element constraints. E.g., if a list is defined as
containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, then this
case will be handled as a transfer syntax error.

\- Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by
the originator of the message).

\- Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).

10.3 Abstract Syntax Error
--------------------------

### 10.3.1 General

An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional NGAP
entity:

1\. receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID);

2\. receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g., ASN.1
definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10, while values 11 to 15
are undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an
abstract syntax error using criticality information sent by the
originator of the message);

3\. does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified
presence of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been
present in the received message.

4\. receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that
message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE
group;

5\. receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence
of the concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE
groups should not have been present in the received message.

6\. receives IEs or IE groups for a functionality that is not supported.

Cases 1, 2 and 6 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on
received Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is
handled based on Criticality information and Presence information for
the missing IE/IE group specified in the version of the specification
used by the receiver. Case 4 (IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with
too many occurrences) and Case 5 (erroneously present conditional IEs or
IE groups) result in rejecting the procedure.

If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the
remaining message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error
that belong to cases 1-3 and 6 act according to the Criticality
Information and Presence Information for the IE/IE group due to which
Abstract Syntax Error occurred in accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and
10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is specified in subclause 10.3.6.

### 10.3.2 Criticality Information

In the NGAP messages there is criticality information set for individual
IEs and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the
receiver how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not
comprehended, i.e., the entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully
or partially) comprehended shall be treated in accordance with its own
criticality information as specified in subclause 10.3.4.

In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing
IE/IE group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).

The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value
of the Criticality Information. The three possible values of the
Criticality Information for an IE/IE group are:

\- Reject IE.

\- Ignore IE and Notify Sender.

\- Ignore IE.

The comprehension of different IEs or IE groups within a standard
version or between standard versions is not mandated. Any IE or IE group
that is not supported shall be considered not comprehended, even if
another IE or IE group for that EP from that standard version is
comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.

The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between
different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not
supported shall be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from
that standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality
shall be applied.

### 10.3.3 Presence Information

For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1
transfer syntax, NGAP specifies separately if the presence of these
IEs/IE groups is optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application
by means of the presence field of the concerning object of class
NGAP-PROTOCOL-IES, NGAP-PROTOCOL-IES-PAIR, NGAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or
NGAP-PRIVATE-IES.

The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:

1\. Optional;

2\. Conditional;

3\. Mandatory.

If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence
of the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the
condition is true according to the version of the specification used by
the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE
group.

If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of
the IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to
the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract
syntax error occurs due to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE
group.

### 10.3.4 Not comprehended IE/IE group

#### 10.3.4.1 Procedure Code

The receiving node shall treat the different types of received
criticality information of the *Procedure Code* IE according to the
following:

**Reject IE:**

\- If a message is received with a *Procedure Code* IE marked with
\"*Reject IE*\" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall reject the procedure using the Error Indication
procedure.

**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**

\- If a message is received with a *Procedure Code* IE marked with
\"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate
the Error Indication procedure.

**Ignore IE:**

\- If a message is received with a *Procedure Code* IE marked with
\"*Ignore IE*\" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the procedure.

When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to
report an ignored procedure it shall include the *Procedure Code* IE,
the *Triggering Message* IE, and the *Procedure Criticality* IE in the
*Criticality Diagnostics* IE.

#### 10.3.4.1A Type of Message

When the receiving node cannot decode the *Type of Message* IE, the
Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause
value.

#### 10.3.4.2 IEs other than the Procedure Code and Type of Message

The receiving node shall treat the different types of received
criticality information of an IE/IE group other than the *Procedure
Code* IE and *Type of Message* IE according to the following:

**Reject IE:**

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing one or
more IEs/IE group marked with \"*Reject IE*\" which the receiving node
does not comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message
shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and
report the rejection of one or more IEs/IE group using the message
normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case
the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to
determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the
message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the
receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the
Error Indication procedure.

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with \"*Reject IE*\" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.

\- If a *response* message is received containing one or more IEs marked
with \"*Reject IE*\", that the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated
and initiate local error handling.

**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing one or
more IEs/IE groups marked with \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" which
the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore
the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the
procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received
(except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and
report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE
groups have been ignored. In case the information received in the
initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs
that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving
node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error
Indication procedure.

\- if a message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a message to
report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" which the
receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the
content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the
procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received
(except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and
initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more
IEs/IE groups have been ignored.

\- If a *response* message is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" which the receiving
node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of
the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if
the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the
reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error
Indication procedure.

**Ignore IE:**

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing one or
more IEs/IE groups marked with \"*Ignore IE*\" which the receiving node
does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the
not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the
not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood
IEs/IE groups.

\- If a *response* message is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with \"*Ignore IE*\" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE
groups.

When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"*Reject
IE*\" or \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" using a response message
defined for the procedure, the *Information Element Criticality
Diagnostics* IE shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE
for each reported IE/IE group.

When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"*Reject
IE*\" or \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" using the Error Indication
procedure, the *Procedure Code* IE, the *Triggering Message* IE,
*Procedure Criticality* IE, and the *Information Element Criticality
Diagnostics* IE shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE
for each reported IE/IE group.

### 10.3.5 Missing IE or IE group

The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the
criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received
message specified in the version of this specification used by the
receiver:

**Reject IE:**

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"*Reject IE*\"; none of the
functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node
shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using
the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message
was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a
message to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE
groups with specified criticality \"*Reject IE*\", the receiving node
shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.

\- if a received *response* message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality \"*Reject IE*, the receiving node shall
consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local
error handling.

**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"*Ignore IE and Notify
Sender*\", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing
and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present
in the message and report in the response message of the procedure that
one or more IEs/IE groups were missing. In case the information received
in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all
IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the
receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the
Error Indication procedure.

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a
message to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"*Ignore IE and Notify
Sender*\", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing
and continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present
in the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report
that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.

\- if a received *response* message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\", the
receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with
the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message
and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more
IEs/IE groups were missing.

**Ignore IE:**

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"*Ignore IE*\", the receiving
node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the
procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.

\- if a received *response* message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality \"*Ignore IE*\", the receiving node shall
ignore that those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the
procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.

When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality
\"*Reject IE*\" or \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" using a response
message defined for the procedure, the *Information Element Criticality
Diagnostics* IE shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE
for each reported IE/IE group.

When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality
\"*Reject IE*\" or \"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*\" using the Error
Indication procedure, the *Procedure Code* IE, the *Triggering Message*
IE, *Procedure Criticality* IE, and the *Information Element Criticality
Diagnostics* IE shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE
for each reported IE/IE group.

### 10.3.6 IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present

If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many
occurrences is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional
presence are present when the condition is not met (i.e., erroneously
present), the receiving node shall behave according to the following:

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing IEs or
IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously
present, none of the functional requests of the message shall be
executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the
cause value \"Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)\"
using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message
was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in
wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the
receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error
Indication procedure, and use cause value \"Abstract Syntax Error
(Falsely Constructed Message)\".

\- If a *response* message is received containing IEs or IE groups in
wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the
receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated
and initiate local error handling.

When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the
specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.

10.4 Logical Error
------------------

Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly,
but the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e.,
semantic error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with
the state of the receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour
shall be performed (unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class
of the elementary procedure, irrespective of the criticality information
of the IEs/IE groups containing the erroneous values.

**Class 1:**

Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful
outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value.
Typical cause values are:

\- Semantic Error.

\- Message not compatible with receiver state.

Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
The *Procedure Code* IE and the *Triggering Message* IE within the
*Criticality Diagnostics* IE shall then be included in order to identify
the message containing the logical error.

Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1
procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully
terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.

**Class 2:**

Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the
procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall
be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The *Procedure Code* IE
and the *Triggering Message* IE within the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE
shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the
logical error.

10.5 Exceptions
---------------

The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take
precedence over any other error handling described in the other
subclauses of clause 10.

\- If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or
Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not
trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local
error handling.

\- In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be
returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of
that message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as
unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.

\- If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause
value shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the
procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality
\"ignore and notify\" have earlier occurred within the same procedure.

\- If an AP ID error is detected, the error handling as described in
subclause 10.6 shall be applied.

10.6 Handling of AP ID
----------------------

NOTE: **The \"first message\", the \"first returned message\" and the
\"last message\" as used below correspond to messages for a
UE-associated logical connection. The \"first message\" has a new AP ID
from the sending node and the \"first returned message\" is the first
response message, which has a new AP ID from the node sending the
\"first returned message\". Thereafter the two AP IDs are included in
all messages over the** UE-associated logical connection unless
otherwise allowed by the specification. The \"last message\" is a
message sent by a node in order to complete the termination of a given
UE-associated logical connection, such that no other messages for the
same connection are expected in either direction. The nodes should
ensure as far as possible that previously allocated AP ID are not
immediately reused.

**If a node receives a first returned message that includes an unknown
local AP ID, the receiving node shall initiate an Error Indication
procedure with inclusion of the received AP IDs from the peer node and
an appropriate cause value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of
any established UE-associated logical connection (for the same NG
interface) having these AP IDs as local or remote identifier.**

**If a node receives a message (other than the first or first returned
messages) including an erroneous AP ID that is either an unknown local
AP ID, or an inconsistent remote AP ID (i.e. it is different to the
remote AP ID stored previously for this UE-associated logical
connection) for the same NG interface:**

\- if this message is not the last message for this UE-associated
logical connection, the node shall initiate an Error Indication
procedure with inclusion of the received AP ID(s) from the peer node and
an appropriate cause value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of
any established UE-associated logical connection (for the same NG
interface) having the erroneous AP ID as either the local or remote
identifier.

\- if this message is the last message for this UE-associated logical
connection, the receiving node shall initiate a local release of any
established UE-associated logical connection (for the same NG interface)
having the erroneous AP ID as either the local or remote identifier.
