-------------------------------

#### A.19.1.1 Cell reselection to FR1 intra-frequency NR case 

##### A.19.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the intra frequency NR cell
reselection requirements for ATG specified in clause 4.2D.2.3.

##### A.19.1.1.2 Test Parameters

The test scenario comprises of 1 NR carrier and 2 cells, supported test
configurations are shown in table A.19.1.1.2-1. The test parameters from
table A.6.1.1.1.2-2 and table A.6.1.1.1.2-3 are used except those
described in the tables A.19.1.1.2-2 and A.19.1.1.2-3. The test consists
of three successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, and T3
respectively. Only Cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior to the
start of the test. Cell 1 and Cell 2 belong to different tracking areas.
Furthermore, UE has not registered with network for the tracking area
containing Cell 2.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.1.1.3 Test Requirements

For UEs that don't support *antennaArrayType-r18* and UEs that support
*antennaArrayType-18*:

The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the
time from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE
camps on Cell 2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending
the *RRCSetupRequest* message to perform a Registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell shall be less
than 34 s.

The cell reselection delay to an already detected cell is defined as the
time from the beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE
camps on Cell 1, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending
the *RRCSetupRequest* message to perform a Registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update on Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay to an already detected cell shall be less
than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90 %.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell can be
expressed as: T~detect,\ NR\_Intra~ + T~SI-NR~, and to an already
detected cell can be expressed as: T~evaluate,\ NR\_\ intra~ + T~SI-NR~,

Where:

T~detect,\ NR\_Intra~ See Table 4.2D.2.3-1 in clause 4.2D.2.3

T~evaluate,\ NR\_\ intra~ See Table 4.2D.2.3-1 in clause 4.2D.2.3

T~SI-NR~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case provided that SIB1 and SIB22 are scheduled with 20 ms
period and 80 ms period, respectively.

For the cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell,
T~detect,\ NR\_\ intra~ + T~SI-NR~ = 33.28 s, allow 34 s.

For the cell re-selection delay to an already detected cell in the test
case, T~evaluate,\ NR\_Intra~ + T~SI-NR~ = 7.68 s, allow 8 s.

#### A.19.1.2 Cell reselection to FR1 inter-frequency NR case

##### A.19.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the inter frequency NR cell
reselection requirements for ATG specified in clause 4.2D.2.4.

##### A.19.1.2.2 Test Parameters

The test scenario comprises of 2 cells on 2 different NR carriers
respectively as given in tables A.19.1.2.2-1, A.19.1.2.2-2 and
A.19.1.2.2-3. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, and T3 respectively. Only Cell 1 is already
identified by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 1 and Cell 2
belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore, UE has not registered
with network for the tracking area containing Cell 2.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.1.2.3 Test Requirements

For UEs that don't support antennaArrayType-r18 and UEs that support
antennaArrayType-18:

The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the
time from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE
camps on Cell 2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending
the *RRCSetupRequest* message to perform a Registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell shall be less
than 34 s.

The cell reselection delay to an already detected cell is defined as the
time from the beginning of time period T3, to the moment when the UE
camps on Cell 1, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending
the *RRCSetupRequest* message to perform a Registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update on Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay to an already detected cell shall be less
than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90 %.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell can be
expressed as: T~detect,\ NR\_Inter~ + T~SI-NR~, and to an already
detected cell can be expressed as: T~evaluate,\ NR\_\ intrer~+ T~SI-NR~,

Where:

T~detect,\ NR\_Inter~ See Table 4.2D.2.4-1 in clause 4.2D.2.4

T~evaluate,\ NR\_\ inter~ See Table 4.2D.2.4-1 in clause 4.2D.2.4

T~SI-NR~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case provided that SIB1 and SIB22 are scheduled with 20 ms
period and 80 ms period, respectively.

For the cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell,
T~detect,\ NR\_\ inter~ + T~SI-NR~ = 33.28 s, allow 34 s.

For the cell re-selection delay to an already detected cell in the test
case, T~evaluate,\ NR\_Inter~ + T~SI-NR~ = 7.68 s, allow 8 s.

#### A.19.1.3 Cell reselection to FR1 inter-frequency NR case for UE configured with *hs-ATG-cellReselectionSet-r18*

##### A.19.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the inter frequency NR cell
reselection requirements for ATG UE configured with
*hs-ATG-cellReselectionSet-r18* and for ATG UE supporting the feature
for enhanced RRM requirements *(Enhanced RRM requirements for
measurements in IDLE and INACTIVE modes for ATG)* specified in
clause 4.2D.2.4.

##### A.19.1.3.2 Test Parameters

The test scenario comprises of 2 cells on 2 different NR carriers
respectively as given in tables A.19.1.3.2-1, A.19.1.3.2-2 and
A.19.1.3.2-3. The test consists of two successive time periods, with
time duration of T1 and T2. Only Cell 1 is already identified by the UE
prior to the start of the test. Cell 1 and Cell 2 belong to different
tracking areas. Furthermore, UE has not registered with network for the
tracking area containing Cell 2.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.1.3.3 Test Requirements

For UEs that don't support antennaArrayType-r18 and UEs that support
antennaArrayType-18:

The cell reselection delay to a newly detectable cell is defined as the
time from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE
camps on Cell 2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending
the *RRCSetupRequest* message to perform a Registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell shall be less
than 12 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90 %.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell can be
expressed as: T~detect,\ NR\_Inter\_enh~ + T~SI-NR~

Where:

T~detect,\ NR\_Inter\_enh~ See Table 4.2D.2.4-2 in clause 4.2D.2.4

T~SI-NR~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case provided that SIB1 and SIB22 are scheduled with 20 ms
period and 80 ms period, respectively.

For the cell re-selection delay to a newly detectable cell,
T~detect,\ NR\_\ inter\_enh~ + T~SI-NR~ = 11.52 s, allow 12 s.

### A.19.2.1 Handover

#### A.19.2.1.1 Intra-frequency handover from FR1 to FR1; known target cell

##### A19.2.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the NR FR1-NR FR1 intra
frequency handover requirements for ATG specified in clause 6.1E.1.2.

##### A.19.2.1.1.2 Test Parameters

Supported test configurations are shown in table A.19.2.1.1.2-1. Both
handover delay and interruption length are tested by using the
parameters in table A.6.3.1.1.2-2 and table A.6.3.1.1.2-3 except those
described in the table A.19.2.1.1.2-2 and A.19.2.1.1.2-3.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE
may not have any timing information of Cell 2.

NR shall send a RRC message implying handover to Cell 2. The RRC message
implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after the UE
has reported Event A3. T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI
containing the RRC message implying handover.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

#### A.19.2.1.2 Inter-frequency handover from FR1 to FR1; unknown target cell

##### A.19.2.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the NR FR1-NR FR1 inter
frequency handover requirements for ATG specified in clause 6.1E.1.2.

##### A.19.2.1.2.2 Test Parameters

Supported test configurations are shown in table A.19.2.1.2.2-1. Both
handover delay and interruption length are tested by using the
parameters in table A.6.3.1.3.2-2 and table A.6.3.1.3.2-3 except those
described in the table A.19.2.1.2.2-2 and A.19.2.1.2.2-3.

The test scenario comprises of two carriers and one cell on each
carrier. No gap patterns are configured in the test case. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2
respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and
the UE receives a RRC handover command from the network. The start of T2
is the instant when the last TTI containing the RRC message implying
handover is sent to the UE.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

interruption length are tested.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of
T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not
have any timing information of Cell 2. During T1, the UE is configured
to measure intra-frequency neighbour cell. The RRC message implying
distance-based handover to Cell 2 with Event D1 shall be sent to UE, at
a time earlier than **T~RRC~ (10 ms) before** the beginning of T2.

Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and offset better than Cell 1 and
location condition event condEventD1-r17 is fulfilled.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.2.2.1.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 872 ms from
the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

NOTE: The handover delay is defined in clause 6.1E.2, can be expressed
as:

D~CHO~ = T~RRC~ + *T~Event\_DU~ +* T~measure~ + T~interrupt~ +
T~CHO\_execution~

where:

RRC procedure delay T~RRC~ = 10 ms and is specified in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

*T~Event\_DU~* = start of T2

At start of T2,

distance to source cell reference location is
$\sqrt{{(3000)}^{2} + {(1200*1000/3600*15 - ( - 4600))}^{2}}$ =
10057.8m, and D1-1 = 10000m

distance to target cell reference location is
$\sqrt{{(3000)}^{2} + {(1200*1000/3600*15 - (14479))}^{2}}$ = 9942.4m,
and D1-2 = 10000m

i.e. D1-1 and D1-2 conditions are fulfilled at start of T2 with \>=50m
location margin.

T~measure~ = max(600 + 200 ms, 0) = 800 ms;

T~interrupt~ = 62 ms; T~CHO\_execution~ = 10 ms.

This gives a total of 800 ms + 62 ms + 10 ms = 872 ms.

#### A.19.2.2.2 Inter-frequency distance-based conditional Handover from FR1 to FR1

##### A.19.2.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for inter-frequency
distance-based conditional handover from FR1 to FR1 for ATG specified in
clause 6.1E.2.

##### A.19.2.2.2.2 Test Parameters

The test scenario comprises of 2 NR carrier and one cell on each carrier
as given in table A.19.2.2.2.2-1, and A.19.2.2.2.2-2. Both handover
delay and interruption length are tested.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of
T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not
have any timing information of Cell 2. During T1, the UE is configured
to measure inter-frequency neighbour cell and Gap pattern ID gp0. The
RRC message implying distance-based handover to Cell 2 with Event D1
shall be sent to UE, at a time earlier than **T~RRC~ (10 ms) before**
the beginning of T2.

Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and offset better than Cell 1 and
after 9976 ms of T2, location condition event condEventD1-r17 is
fulfilled.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.2.2.2.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 later than 9976 ms
and less than 10048 ms from the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

NOTE: The handover delay is defined in clause 6.1E.2, can be expressed
as:

D~CHO~ = T~RRC~ + *T~Event\_DU~ +* T~measure~ + T~interrupt~ +
T~CHO\_execution~

where:

RRC procedure delay T~RRC~ = 10 ms and is specified in clause 12 in
TS 38.331 \[2\].

*T~Event\_DU~* = start of T2

At 9976 ms after start of T2,

distance to source cell reference location is
$\sqrt{{(3000)}^{2} + {(1200*1000/3600*14.976 - ( - 4600))}^{2}}$ =
10050.2m, and D1-1 = 10000m

distance to target cell reference location is
$\sqrt{{(3000)}^{2} + {(1200*1000/3600*14.976 - (14479))}^{2}}$ =
9949.08m, and D1-2 = 10000m

i.e. D1-1 and D1-2 conditions are fulfilled at start of T2 with \>=50m
location margin.

T~measure~ = max(600 + 200 ms, 9976 ms) = 9976 ms;

T~interrupt~ = 62 ms; T~CHO\_execution~ = 10 ms.

This gives a total of 9976 ms + 62 ms + 10 ms = 10048 ms.

###### A.19.2.3.1.2.2 Test Requirements

For UEs that don't support *antennaArrayType-r18* and UEs that support
*antennaArrayType-18*:

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the UE starts to send PRACH preambles
to Cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message to Cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR inter frequency cell
without serving cell timing shall be less than 3 s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90 %.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
following expression:

T~re-establish\_delay~= T~UL\_grant~ + T~UE\_re-establish\_delay~.

Where:

T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception at the system simulator
is used as a trigger for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~
is not used.

$T_{\text{UE}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = 50\ \text{ms} + T_{\text{identify}\_\text{intra}\_\text{NR}} + \sum_{i = 1}^{\text{Nfreq} - 1}T_{\text{identify}\_\text{inter}\_\text{NR},i} + T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$

N~freq~ = 2

*T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 800 ms

*T~identify\_inter\_NR~* = 800 ms

T~SI~ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for receiving all the
relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331 for the target
inter-frequency NR cell.

T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.

This gives a total of 2945 ms, allow 3 s in the test case.

#### A.19.2.3.2 Random Access for ATG UE

A.19.2.3.2.1 4-step RA type contention based random access test in FR1
for NR standalone

###### A.19.2.3.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the behavior of the random
access procedure is according to the requirements and that the PRACH
power settings and timing are within specified limits. This test will
verify the requirements in clause 6.2D.2.2 and clause 7.1D.2 in an AWGN
with constant residual doppler model.

For this test one cell is used and configured as PCell in FR1. Supported
test configurations are shown in table A.19.2.3.2.1.1-1. UE capable of
SA with PCell in FR1 needs to be tested by using the parameters in table
A.6.3.2.2.1.1-2, except those described in the Table A.19.2.3.2.1.1-2.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 2240 ms
from the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to NR observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90 %.

NOTE: The redirection delay can be expressed as:

T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~ = T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ +
T~identify-NR~ + T~SI-NR~ + T~RACH~,

where:

T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ = 110 ms in the test.

T~identify-NR~ = 680 ms in the test.

T~SI-NR~ = 1280 ms, it is the time required for receiving all the
relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331 for the target NR
cell.

T~RACH~ = 170 ms in the test.

#### A.19.3.1.1 ATG UE Transmit Timing Test for FR1

##### A.19.3.1.1.1 Test Purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE can follow frame
timing change of the connected gNodeb and that the UE initial transmit
timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in one adjustment,
minimum and maximum adjustment rate are within the specified limits.
This test will verify the requirements in clause 7.1D.2.

Supported test configurations refer to Table A.6.4.1.1.1-1.

A single NR cell is used during the test. Table A.19.3.1.1.1-1 defines
the parameters to be configured and strength of the transmitted signals.
The transmit timing is verified by the UE transmitting SRS using the
configuration SRSconfig.1 defined in table A.6.4.1.1.1-3.

Changed UE location with the mobility assumption of 1200km/h, the
specific UE location should be emulated by test system and provided to
UE by AT command or GNSS simulator.

##### A.19.3.1.1.2 Test requirements

The test sequence shall be carried out in RRC\_CONNECTED for every test
case.

Following will be the test sequence for this test

1\) Setup NR PCell according to parameters given in table
A.19.3.1.1.1-1.

2\) After connection set up with the cell, the test equipment will
verify that the timing of the NR cell is within (N~TA~ +
N~TA\_offset~+$N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{UE}}$) ×T~c~ ± T~e\_ATG~ of the
first detected path of DL SSB.

a\. The N~TA~ offset value (in T~c~ units) is 25600

b\. The T~e\_ATG~ values depend on the DL and UL SCS for which the test
is being run and are given in table 7.1D.2-1

c\. The $N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{UE}}$ value is computed by the UE
based on UE position and BS location.

3\) The test system shall adjust the timing of the DL path by values
given in table A.19.3.1.1.2-1

Table A.19.3.1.1.2-1: Adjustment Value for DL Timing

  SCS of SSB signals (KHz)   Adjustment Value

  30                         +32\*64T~c~        +16\*64T~c~

4\) The test system shall verify that the adjustment step size and the
adjustment rate shall be according to requirements specified in clause
7.1D.2 Table 7.1D.2.1-1 until the UE transmit timing offset is within
(N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~+$N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{UE}}$) ×T~c~ ±
T~e\_ATG~ respective to the first path (in time) of DL SSB used by the
UE to determine downlink timing is received from the reference cell at
the UE antenna.

5\) The test system shall verify that the UE transmit timing offset
stays within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~+$N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{UE}}$)
×T~c~ ± T~e\_ATG~ of the first path (in time) of DL SSB used by the UE
to determine downlink timing is received from the reference cell at the
UE antenna.

### A.19.3.2 UE timer accuracy

### A.19.3.3 Timing advance

#### A.19.3.3.1 SA FR1 timing advance adjustment accuracy

##### A.19.3.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of the test is to verify UE Timing Advance adjustment delay
and accuracy requirement defined in clause 7.3D.

##### A.19.3.3.1.2 Test Parameters

Supported test configurations refer to table A.6.4.3.1.2-1. Both timing
advance adjustment delay and accuracy are tested by using the parameters
in table A.6.4.3.1.2-2, A.6.4.3.1.2-3 and A.6.4.3.1.2-4, except those
defined in table A.19.3.3.1.2-1.

In all test cases, single cell is used. Each test consists of two
successive time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.
In each time period, timing advance commands are sent to the UE and
Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), as specified in table A.6.4.3.1.2-3,
are sent from the UE and received by the test equipment. By measuring
the reception of the SRS, the transmit timing, and hence the timing
advance adjustment accuracy, can be measured.

During time period T1, the test equipment shall send one message with a
Timing Advance Command MAC Control Element, as specified in
clause 6.1.3.4 in TS 38.321 \[7\]. The Timing Advance Command value
shall be set to 31, which according to clause 4.2 in TS 38.213 \[3\]
results in zero adjustment of the Timing Advance. In this way, a
reference value for the timing advance used by the UE is established.

During time period T2, the test equipment shall send a sequence of
messages with Timing Advance Command MAC Control Elements, with Timing
Advance Command value specified in table A.6.4.3.1.2-2. This value shall
result in changes of the timing advance used by the UE, and the accuracy
of the change shall then be measured, using the SRS sent from the UE.

As specified in clause 7.3D.2.1, the UE adjusts its uplink timing at
slot n+k*+2^µ^* ${\bullet K}_{\text{offset}}$ for a timing advance
command received in slot n. This delay must be taken into account when
measuring the timing advance adjustment accuracy, via the SRS sent from
the UE.

The UE Time Alignment Timer, described in clause 5.2 in TS 38.321 \[7\],
shall be configured so that it does not expire in the duration of the
test.

Changed UE location with the mobility assumption of 1200km/h, the
specific UE location should be emulated by test system and provided to
UE by AT command or GNSS simulator.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.3.3.1.3 Test Requirements

The UE shall apply the signalled Timing Advance value to the
transmission timing at the designated activation time i.e. *k+1+2^µ^*
${\bullet K}_{\text{offset}}$ slots after the reception of the timing
advance command, where k=5.

The Timing Advance adjustment accuracy shall be within the limits
specified in clause 7.3D.2.2.

The rate of correct Timing Advance adjustments observed during repeated

A.19.4 Signalling characteristics
---------------------------------

### A.19.4.1 Radio link Monitoring

In the following clause, any uplink signal transmitted by the UE is used
for detecting the In-/Out-of-Sync state of the UE. In terms of
measurement, the uplink signal is verified on the basis of the UE output
power:

For UE with multiple transmit antennas, transmit OFF power is measured
as the mean power at each transmit connector.

\- UE output power higher than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as defined in
TS 38.101-1 \[18\]) means uplink signal

\- UE output power equal to or less than Transmit OFF power -50 dBm (as
defined in TS 38.101-1 \[18\]) means no uplink signal.

#### A.19.4.1.1 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### A.19.4.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the
out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 8.1D.

In the test, UE is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0,
and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations are shown in
table A.19.4.1.1.1-1. The test parameters are given in tables
A.19.4.1.1.1-2, A.19.4.1.1.1-3, and A.19.4.1.1.1-4 below. There is one
cell (Cell 1), which is the active NR cell, in the test. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2
and T3 respectively. Figure A.19.4.1.1.1-1 shows the variation of the
downlink SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync
states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be
fully synchronized to Cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic
CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5 ms. The UE is configured
to perform inter-frequency measurements using Gap Pattern ID \#0 (40 ms)
in test 1.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall
transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time point C
(D1 second after the start of the time duration T3).

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

#### A.19.4.1.2 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### A.19.4.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the
out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 8.1D.

In the test, UE is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0,
and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations are shown in
table A.19.4.1.2.1-1. The test parameters are given in tables
A.19.4.1.2.1-2, and A.19.4.1.2.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell 1),
which is the active cell, in the test. The test consists of five
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
respectively. Figure A.19.4.1.2.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior
to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized
to Cell 1. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be
fully synchronized to Cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic
CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5 ms.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

Figure A.19.4.1.2.1-1: SNR variation for in-sync testing

##### A.19.4.1.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and
T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least
in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to the
configured periodic CSI reporting.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

#### A.19.4.1.3 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### A.19.4.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the
out of sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio
link quality of the PCell when no DRX is used. This test will partly
verify the FR1 PCell CSI-RS Out-of-sync radio link monitoring
requirements in clause 8.1D.

The test parameters are given in tables A.19.4.1.3.1-1, A.19.4.1.3.1-2,
A.19.4.1.3.1-3, and A.19.4.1.3.1-3A below. There is one cell, Cell 1
which is the PCell, in the test. The test consists of three successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure
A.19.4.1.3.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to
emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time
duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The UE shall
be configured for periodic CSI reporting of 5 ms. In the test, DRX
configuration is not enabled. The UE is configured to perform
inter-frequency measurements using GP ID \#0 (40 ms) in test. In the
test, SSB0 is configured as the BFD-RS.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

Figure A.19.4.1.3.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS out-of-sync testing

##### A.19.4.1.3.2 Test Requirements

The UE behaviour during time durations T1, T2, and T3 shall be as
follows:

During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 at least in all uplink slots configured
for CSI transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting
for Cell 1.

The UE shall stop transmitting uplink signal in Cell 1 no later than
time point C (D~1~ ms after the start of the time duration T3) on the
PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

#### A.19.4.1.4 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### A.19.4.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects the
in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio link
quality of the PCell when no DRX is used. This test will partly verify
the FR1 PCell CSI-RS In-sync radio link monitoring requirements in
clause 8.1D.

The test parameters are given in tables A.19.4.1.4.1-1, A.19.4.1.4.1-2,
and A.19.4.1.4.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell 1), which is the PCell
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
A.19.4.1.4.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to
emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time
duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The UE shall
be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of
5 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is not enabled. In the test, SSB0
is configured as the BFD-RS.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

Figure A.19.4.1.4.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS in-sync testing

##### A.19.4.1.4.2 Test Requirements

The UE behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and
T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (T6 second after the
start of time duration T5) the UE shall transmit uplink signal at least
in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to the
configured periodic CSI reporting on the PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

### A.19.4.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link recovery procedures

#### A.19.4.2.1 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based BFD and LR in non-DRX mode

##### A.19.4.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects
SSB-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and
that the UE performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam
candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for
beam failure detection within the UEs active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test
will partly verify the SSB based beam failure detection and link
recovery for an FR1 serving cell requirements in clause 8.5D.

The test parameters are given in tables A.19.4.2.1.1-1, A.19.4.2.1.1-2,
A.19.4.2.1.1-3 and A.19.4.2.1.1-4 below. There is one cell, Cell 1 which
is the active cell, in the test. The test consists of five successive
time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively.
Figure A.19.4.2.1.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the SSB
in set q~0~ in the active cell to emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure
A.19.4.2.1.1-2 shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP of the SSB in
set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery. Prior to the
start of the time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to
Cell 1. The UE shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a
reporting periodicity of 5 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is not
enabled. The UE is configured to perform inter-frequency measurements
using GP ID \#0 (40 ms) in test 1.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

Figure A.19.4.2.1.1-2: L1-RSRP level variation for SSB-based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing in non-DRX mode

##### A.19.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall be as
follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the UE shall transmit uplink signal
at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell 1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the UE shall detect beam failure and initiate link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the UE measures and evaluate beam candidate from beam
candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 120+10 ms after
the start of T5, the UE shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The UE shall not transmit preamble on
a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the UE. The rate of correct events observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90 %.

#### A.19.4.2.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based BFD and LR in non-DRX mode

##### A.19.4.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE properly detects
CSI-RS-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell
and that the UE performs correct CSI-RS-based link recovery based on
beam candicate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring
for beam failure detection within the UEs active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test
will partly verify the CSI-RS based beam failure detection and link
recovery for an FR1 serving cell requirements in clause 8.5D.

The test parameters are given in tables A.19.4.2.2.1-1, A.19.4.2.2.1-2,
and below. There is one cell, Cell 1 which is the active cell, in the
test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure A.19.4.2.2.1-1
shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the CSI-RS in set q~0~ in the
active cell to emulate CSI-RS based beam failure. Figure A.19.4.2.2.1-2
shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP of the CSI-RS in set q~1~ of
the candidate beam used for link recovery. Prior to the start of the
time duration T1, the UE shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The UE
shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting
periodicity of 5 ms. In the test, DRX configuration is not enabled.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.4.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall be as
follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the UE shall transmit uplink signal
at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell 1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the UE shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the shall detect beam failure and initiat link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the UE measures and evaluate beam candidate from beam
candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 30+10 ms after
the start of T5, the UE shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The UE shall not transmit preamble on
a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the UE. The rate of correct events observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90 %.

##### A.19.4.3.1.1 NR FR1 DL active BWP switch with non-DRX in SA

##### A.19.4.3.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#a.19.4.3.1.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify the DL BWP switch delay
requirement defined in clause 8.6D.

The supported test configurations are shown in table A.19.4.3.1.1.1-1.
The test scenario comprises of one cell (Cell 1) as given in table
A.19.4.3.1.1.1-2. Cell-specific parameters of the cell are specified in
table A.19.4.3.1.1.1-3 below.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on Cell 1
to ensure that the UE will have ACK/NACK sending.

Before the test starts,

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 on radio channel 1.

\- UE is configured with 2 different UE-specific downlink bandwidth
parts, BWP-1 and BWP-2 before starting the test. BWP-1 and BWP-2 always
include bandwidth of the initial DL BWP and SSB.

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is BWP-1.

\- UE is configured with a *bwp-InactivityTimer* timer value for Cell 1.

The cell has constant signal levels throughout the test.

The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with durations of T1,
T2, and T3, respectively.

During T1,

Time period T1 starts when a DCI format 1\_1 command for DL BWP switch,
sent from the test equipment to the UE, is received at the UE side in
Cell 1's slot \# denoted *i*. The UE shall switch its bandwidth part
from BWP-1 to BWP-2.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH on the first DL slot that occurs
after the beginning of Cell 1's DL slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*) as
defined in clause 8.6 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for the Cell 1
no later than the first UL slot that occurs after the beginning of slot
(*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*). The UE shall be continuously scheduled on
Cell 1's BWP-2 starting from the first DL slot that occurs after the
beginning of slot (*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*).

During T2, the test equipment won't transmit DCI format for PDSCH
reception on Cell 1.

During T3,

The time period T3 starts from the slot \#*j*, where j is the first slot
of the subframe immediately after *bwp-InactivityTimer* timer expires.
The UE shall switch its bandwidth part from BWP-2 back to the default
bandwidth part -- BWP-1.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH on the first DL slot that occurs
after the beginning of Cell 1's slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*) as defined
in clause 8.6 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for the Cell 1 at
latest on the first UL slot that occurs after the beginning of slot
(*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~+k1*). The UE shall be continuously scheduled on
Cell 1's BWP-1 starting from the first DL slot that occurs after the
beginning of slot (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*).

The test equipment verifies the DL BWP switch time by counting the slots
from the time when the BWP switch command is received or
*bwp-InactivityTimer* timer expires till an ACK/NACK is received.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.4.3.1.1**.**2 Test Requirements {#a.19.4.3.1.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

During T1, the UE shall start to send the ACK/NACK for PCell from the
first UL slot that occurs after the beginning of DL slot
(*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*).

During T3, the UE shall start to send the ACK/NACK for PCell from the
first UL slot that occurs after the beginning of DL slot
(*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*).

Where, *k1* is the timing between DL data receiving and acknowledgement
as specified in \[7\].

Depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\], UE shall finish
BWP switch within the time duration *T~BWPswitchDelay~* defined in table
8.6.2-1.

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed Cell 1 active BWP switch delay to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

NOTE: During T1, T3 if there are no uplink resources for reporting the
ACK/NACK in the first UL slot that occurs after beginning of DL slot
(*i+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*), (*j+T~BWPswitchDelay~*+*k1*), then the UE
shall use the next available uplink resource for reporting the
corresponding ACK/NACK.

#### A.19.4.3.2 RRC-based Active BWP Switch

##### A.19.4.3.2.1 NR FR1 DL active BWP switch of Cell with non-DRX in SA

##### A.19.4.3.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#a.19.4.3.2.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify the DL BWP switch delay
requirement for RRC-based BWP switch defined in clause 8.6D.

The supported test configurations are shown in table A.19.4.3.2.1.1-1.
The test scenario comprises of one Cell (Cell 1) as given in table
A.19.4.3.2.1.1-2. Cell-specific parameters of Cell are specified in
table A.19.4.3.2.1.1-3 below.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on Cell 1
to ensure that the UE will have ACK/NACK sending.

Before the test starts,

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 on radio channel 1.

\- UE has bandwidth part BWP-1 in its RRC-configuration for Cell 1.

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is BWP-1 of initial condition in Cell 1.

All cells have constant signal levels throughout the test.

The test consists of 1 time period, with duration of T1.

During T1,

Time period T1 starts when a *RRCReconfiguration* with updated bandwidth
part configuration, sent from the test equipment to the UE, is
completely received at the UE side in PCell's slot \# denoted *i*. The
UE shall reconfigure its bandwidth part with the updated bandwidth part
BWP-1 of final condition.

The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH on PCell from the first DL slot
that occurs after the beginning of DL
slot$\ i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
as defined in clause 8.6.3 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for the
PCell from the first UL slot that occurs after the beginning of DL
slot$\ i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}} + k1$
on BWP-1 of final condition. The UE shall be continuously scheduled on
PCell's BWP-1 of final condition starting from the first DL slot right
after slot
$i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$.

T~RRCprocessingDelay~ and T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ are defined in clause
8.6.3.

The test equipment verifies the DL BWP switch time in Cell by counting
the time from the time when the RRC Reconfiguration message including
updated BWP configuration is sent till the time when a vaild ACK/NACK is
received is received.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.4.3.2.1.2 Test Requirements {#a.19.4.3.2.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

During T1, the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for
the Cell from the first DL slot that occurs right after the begining of
slot
$i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for PCell from the first UL slot
that occurs after the beginning of DL
slot$\ i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}} + k1$.

Where, *k1* is the timing between DL data receiving and acknowledgement
as specified in \[7\].

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed Cell active BWP switch delay to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

### A.19.4.4 UE specific CBW change

#### A19.4.4.1 UE specific CBW change on PCell in FR1 in non-DRX 

##### A19.4.4.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the UE specific CBW change delay
requirement defined in clause 8.13D.

The supported test configurations are shown in table A.19.4.4.1.1-1. The
test scenario comprises of one Cell (Cell 1), which is PCell as given in
table A.19.4.4.1.1-2. Cell-specific parameters are specified in table
A.19.4.4.1.1-3.

PDCCHs indicating new transmissions shall be sent continuously on Cell 1
to ensure that the UE sends ACK/NACK during the test.

Before the test starts:

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 (PCell) on radio channel 1.

\- UE has bandwidth part BWP-1 in its RRC-configuration for Cell 1
(PCell).

\- UE is indicated in *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* that the active DL BWP
is BWP-1 of initial condition in PCell.

\- UE has been configured with UE specific CBW (CBW-1).

\- UE is indicated in *SCS-SpecificCarrier* \[2\] that the UE specific
CBW is CBW-1 as the initial condition in Cell 1 (PCell).

Cell 1 (PCell) has constant signal levels throughout the test.

The test consists of 1 time period, with duration of T1.

During T1,

> Time period T1 starts when a *RRCReconfiguration* containing
> *SCS-SpecificCarrier* with updated UE specific CBW, sent from the test
> equipment to the UE, is completely received at the UE side in PCell's
> slot \# denoted *i*. The UE shall reconfigure its UE specific CBW with
> the updated CBW-2 for the final condition.
>
> The UE shall be able to receive PDSCH on PCell from the first DL slot
> that occurs after the beginning of DL
> slot$\ i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{CBWchangeDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
> as defined in clause 8.13 and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for
> PCell from the first UL slot that occurs after the beginning of DL
> slot$\ i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{CBWchangeDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}} + k1$
> on the PCell's BWP-1 on CBW-2 for the final condition. The UE shall be
> continuously scheduled on the PCell's BWP-1 on CBW-2 for the final
> condition starting from the first DL slot right after slot
> $i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{CBWchangeDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$.
>
> $T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ and $T_{\text{CBWchangeDelayRRC}}$ are
> defined in clause 8.13.

The test equipment verifies the UE specific CBW switching delay in PCell
by estimating the time from the moment the RRC Reconfiguration message
including updated UE specific CBW configuration is sent until the moment
a vaild ACK/NACK is received.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.4.4.1.2 Test Requirements

During T1, the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for
the PCell from the first DL slot that occurs right after the begining of
slot
$i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{CBWchangeDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
and starts to report valid ACK/NACK for PCell from the first UL slot
that occurs after the beginning of DL
slot$\ i + \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{CBWchangeDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}} + k1$.

Where, *k1* is the timing between DL data receiving and acknowledgement
as specified in \[7\].

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed UE specific CBW change delay on the PCell to be counted as
correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

### A.19.4.5 Pathloss reference signal switching delay

#### A.19.4.5.1 MAC-CE based pathloss reference signal switch delay

##### A.19.4.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the MAC-CE based pathloss
reference signal switch delay requirement defined in clause 8.14D.

The supported test configurations are shown in table A.19.4.5**.1.**1-1.
The test scenario comprises of one cell (Cell 1) as given in table
A.19.4.5**.1.1**-2. Cell-specific parameters of the cell are specified
in table A.19.4.5**.1**.1-3 below.

The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with duration of T1, T2
and T3, respectively.

Prior to the start of the time duration T1,

\- UE is connected to Cell 1 on radio channel 1.

\- UE shall be fully synchronized to SSB \#0.

During T1,

\- The UE shall track SSB \#1 so that SSB \#1 as a pathloss reference
signal is known to the UE.

Time period T2 starts when the UE is configured of the power headroom
reporting functionality by upper layers by the test equipment and the UE
shall transmit a PHR during T2.

During T2,

\- UE is configured with a *phr-ProhibitTimer* timer value for Cell 1.

\- UE is configured with a *phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange* value for Cell 1.

During T3,

Time period T3 starts when a PDSCH carrying MAC-CE activation for
pathloss reference signal switch, sent from the test equipment to the UE
to swicth the pathloss reference signal from SSB 0 to SSB 1, is received
at the UE side in Cell 1's slot \# denoted *i*. The UE shall switch its
pathloss reference signal to the target one and send PHR.

The UE shall be able to apply the target pathloss reference signal of
the serving cell on which pathloss reference signal switch occurs no
later than the slot *i* + $T_{\text{HARQ}}$+
$\left\lceil \frac{3\ ms\  + \ 5*T_{\text{target}\_\text{PL} - \text{RS}}\  + \ 2\ ms}{\text{NR}\ \text{slot}\ \text{length}} \right\rceil$
as defined in clause 8.14. The UE shall be able to apply old pathloss
reference signals until the slot *i* + $T_{\text{HARQ}}$+
$3N_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ as defined in clause 8.14.

The test equipment verifies the pathloss RS switch time by counting the
slots from the time when the pathloss RS switch command is transmitted
till a PHR is received during T3.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

##### A.19.4.5.1.2 Test Requirements

During T3, the UE shall start to send the PHR for PCell no later than
the slot *i* + $T_{\text{HARQ}}$+
$\left\lceil \frac{3\ ms\  + \ 5*T_{\text{target}\_\text{PL} - \text{RS}}\  + \ 2\ ms}{\text{NR}\ \text{slot}\ \text{length}} \right\rceil$.

During T3, the UE shall start to send the PHR for PCell no earlier than
the slot *i* + $T_{\text{HARQ}}$+ $3N_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$.

Where, $T_{\text{HARQ}}$ is the timing between pathloss reference MAC-CE
activation command and acknowledgement as specified in \[7\],
$T_{target\_ PL - RS}$ is the periodicity of the target pathloss
reference signal which is SSB in this test.

During T3, UE shall send L1-RSRP report with measurement results for
both SSB0 and SSB1.

All of the above test requirements shall be fulfilled in order for the
observed pathloss RS switch delay to be counted as correct.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90 %.

NOTE: The UE shall be given proper uplink transmission grant during T2
and T3.

A.19.5 Measurement procedure
----------------------------

### A.19.5.1 Intra-frequency Measurements

#### A.19.5.1.1 SA event triggered reporting tests without gap without SSB index reading under non-DRX

##### A.19.5.1.1.1 Test purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event. This test will partly verify the intra-frequency
cell search requirements in clauses 9.2D.5.1 and 9.2D.5.2.

##### A.19.5.1.1.2 Test parameters

Two cells are deployed in the test, which are FR1 PCell (Cell 1) and a
FR1 neighbour cell (Cell 2) on the same frequency as the PCell. The test
configurations are given in the Table A.19.5.1.1.2-1, the test
parameters for PCell and neighbour cell refer to Table A.6.6.1.1.1.2-2
and A.6.6.1.1.1.2-3 except those described in the table A.19.5.1.1.2-2.
In the measurement control information, a measurement object is
configured for the frequency of the PCell, and it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event A3 is used. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, and T2
respectively. During time duration T1, the UE shall not have any timing
information of Cell 2.

UE positioning and UE speed are set by AT command. UE speed is 0km/h, UE
specific positioning is emulated by test system.

The specific gNB reference location is emulated by test system.

  NOTE 1: The UE is only required to be tested in one of the supported test configurations   

##### A.19.5.5.1.2 Test Parameters

In each test there are two cells: Cell 1 and Cell 2. Cell 1 is the FR1
PCell and Cell 2 is an FR1 neighbour cell on the same frequency as the
PCell. The test parameters from Table A.6.6.7.1.2-2 and table
A.6.6.7.1.2-3 are used except those described in A.19.5.5.1.2-1.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time durations
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE
does not have any timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2
becomes detectable. A measurement object is configured for the frequency
of the PCell and it is indicated to the UE that event-triggered
reporting with Event A3 is used. The UE is expected to detect and send a
measurement report with Event A3.

A new RRC message triggering CGI identification shall be sent to the UE
during period T2, after the UE has reported Event A3. The RRC message
shall create a measurement report configuration with purpose *reportCGI
and* *useAutonomousGaps* set to TRUE. The start of T3 is the instant
when the last TTI containing the RRC message implying CGI identification
is sent to the UE.

The test equipment verifies that potential interruption is carried out
correctly by monitoring ACK/NACK sent in PCell during T3 until a
measurement report with CGI is sent.
