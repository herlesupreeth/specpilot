4 General principles
====================

The general principles guiding the definition of NG-RAN architecture as
well as the NG-RAN interfaces are the following:

\- Logical separation of signalling and data transport networks.

\- NG-RAN and 5GC functions are fully separated from transport
functions. Addressing scheme used in NG-RAN and 5GC shall not be tied to
the addressing schemes of transport functions. The fact that some NG-RAN
or 5GC functions reside in the same equipment as some transport
functions does not make the transport functions part of the NG-RAN or
the 5GC.

\- Mobility for an RRC connection is fully controlled by the NG-RAN.

\- The NG-RAN interfaces are defined along the following principles:

\- The functional division across the interfaces have as few options as
possible.

\- Interfaces are based on a logical model of the entity controlled
through this interface.

\- One physical network element can implement multiple logical nodes.

5 General architecture
======================

5.1 General
-----------

The protocols over Uu and NG interfaces are divided into two structures:

**- User plane protocols**

These are the protocols implementing the actual PDU Session service,
i.e. carrying user data through the access stratum.

**- Control plane protocols**

These are the protocols for controlling the PDU Sessions and the
connection between the UE and the network from different aspects
(including requesting the service, controlling different transmission
resources, handover etc.). Also a mechanism for transparent transfer of
NAS messages is included.

5.2 User plane
--------------

The PDU Session Resource service is offered from SAP to SAP by the
Access Stratum. Figure 5.2-1 shows the protocols on the Uu and the NG
interfaces that linked together provide this PDU Session Resource
service.

Note 1: The radio interface protocols are defined in TS 38.2xx and
TS 38.3xx.

Note 2: The NG interface protocols are defined in TS 38.41x.

Figure 5.2-1: NG and Uu user plane

5.3 Control plane
-----------------

Figure 5.3-1 shows the control plane (signalling) protocol stacks on NG
and Uu interfaces.

Note 1: The radio interface protocols are defined in TS 38.2xx and
TS 38.3xx.

Note 2: The protocol is defined in TS 38.41x. (Description of NG
interface).

Note 3: CM, SM: This exemplifies a set of NAS control protocols between
UE and 5GC. The evolution of the protocol architecture for these
protocols is outside the scope of the present document.

Figure 5.3-1: NG and Uu control plane

NOTE: Both the Radio protocols and the NG protocols contain a mechanism
to transparently transfer NAS messages.

6 NG-RAN architecture
=====================

6.1 Overview
------------

### 6.1.1 Overall Architecture of NG-RAN

Figure 6.1-1: Overall architecture

The NG-RAN consists of a set of gNBs connected to the 5GC through the NG
interface.

NOTE 1: As specified in TS 38.300 \[2\], NG-RAN could also consists of a
set of ng-eNBs, an ng-eNB may consist of an ng-eNB-CU and one or more
ng-eNB-DU(s). An ng-eNB-CU and an ng-eNB-DU is connected via W1
interface. The general principle described in this clause also applies
to ng-eNB and W1 interface, if not explicitly specified otherwise.

An gNB can support FDD mode, TDD mode or dual mode operation.

gNBs can be interconnected through the Xn interface.

A gNB may consist of a gNB-CU and one or more gNB-DU(s). A gNB-CU and a
gNB-DU is connected via F1 interface.

One gNB-DU is connected to only one gNB-CU.

NOTE 2: In case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast, each
Cell Identity associated with a subset of PLMNs, PNI-NPNs or SNPNs
corresponds to a gNB-DU and the gNB-CU it is connected to, i.e. the
corresponding gNB-DUs share the same physical layer cell resources.

NOTE 3: For resiliency, a gNB-DU may be connected to multiple gNB-CUs by
appropriate implementation.

NG, Xn and F1 are logical interfaces.

For NG-RAN, the NG and Xn-C interfaces for a gNB consisting of a gNB-CU
and gNB-DUs, terminate in the gNB-CU. For EN-DC, the S1-U and X2-C
interfaces for a gNB consisting of a gNB-CU and gNB-DUs, terminate in
the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU and connected gNB-DUs are only visible to other
gNBs and the 5GC as a gNB. A possible deployment scenario is described
in Annex A.

The node hosting user plane part of NR PDCP (e.g. gNB-CU, gNB-CU-UP, and
for EN-DC, MeNB or SgNB depending on the bearer split) shall perform
user inactivity monitoring and further informs its inactivity or
(re)activation to the node having C-plane connection towards the core
network (e.g. over E1, X2). The node hosting NR RLC (e.g. gNB-DU) may
perform user inactivity monitoring and further inform its inactivity or
(re)activation to the node hosting control plane, e.g. gNB-CU or
gNB-CU-CP.

UL PDCP configuration (i.e. how the UE uses the UL at the assisting
node) is indicated via X2-C (for EN-DC), Xn-C (for NG-RAN) and F1-C.
Radio Link Outage/Resume for DL and/or UL is indicated via X2-U (for
EN-DC), Xn-U (for NG-RAN) and F1-U.

The NG-RAN is layered into a Radio Network Layer (RNL) and a Transport
Network Layer (TNL).

The NG-RAN architecture, i.e. the NG-RAN logical nodes and interfaces
between them, is defined as part of the RNL.

For each NG-RAN interface (NG, Xn, F1) the related TNL protocol and the
functionality are specified. The TNL provides services for user plane
transport, signalling transport.

In NG-Flex configuration, each NG-RAN node is connected to all AMFs of
AMF Sets within an AMF Region supporting at least one slice also
supported by the NG-RAN node. The AMF Set and the AMF Region are defined
in TS 23.501 \[3\].

If security protection for control plane and user plane data on TNL of
NG-RAN interfaces has to be supported, NDS/IP TS 33.501 \[13\] shall be
applied.

### 6.1.2 Overall architecture for separation of gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP

The overall architecture for separation of gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP is
depicted in Figure 6.1.2-1.

NOTE 0: NG-RAN could also consist of a set of ng-eNBs, an ng-eNB may
consist of an ng-eNB-CU-CP, one or more ng-eNB-CU-UP(s), and one or more
ng-eNB-DU(s). An ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP is connected via the
E1 interface. An ng-eNB-DU is connected to an ng-eNB-CU-CP via the W1-C
interface, and to an ng-eNB-CU-UP via the W1-U interface. The general
principle described in this clause also applies to ng-eNB and its
corresponding E1 and W1 interfaces, if not explicitly specified
otherwise.

Figure 6.1.2-1. Overall architecture for separation of gNB-CU-CP and
gNB-CU-UP

\- A gNB may consist of a gNB-CU-CP, multiple gNB-CU-UPs and multiple
gNB-DUs;

\- The gNB-CU-CP is connected to the gNB-DU through the F1-C interface;

\- The gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-DU through the F1-U interface;

\- The gNB-CU-UP is connected to the gNB-CU-CP through the E1 interface;

\- One gNB-DU is connected to only one gNB-CU-CP;

\- One gNB-CU-UP is connected to only one gNB-CU-CP;

NOTE 1: For resiliency, a gNB-DU and/or a gNB-CU-UP may be connected to
multiple gNB-CU-CPs by appropriate implementation.

\- One gNB-DU can be connected to multiple gNB-CU-UPs under the control
of the same gNB-CU-CP;

\- One gNB-CU-UP can be connected to multiple DUs under the control of
the same gNB-CU-CP;

NOTE 2: The connectivity between a gNB-CU-UP and a gNB-DU is established
by the gNB-CU-CP using Bearer Context Management functions.

NOTE 3: The gNB-CU-CP selects the appropriate gNB-CU-UP(s) for the
requested services for the UE. In case of multiple CU-UPs they belong to
same security domain as defined in TS 33.210 \[18\].

NOTE 4: Data forwarding between gNB-CU-UPs during intra-gNB-CU-CP
handover within a gNB may be supported by Xn-U.

### 6.1.3 Overall Architecture of IAB

Figure 6.1.3-1: Overall architecture of IAB

The NG-RAN supports IAB by the IAB-node wirelessly connecting to the gNB
capable of serving the IAB-nodes, named IAB-donor.

The IAB-donor consists of an IAB-donor-CU and one or more
IAB-donor-DU(s). In case of separation of gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP, the
IAB-donor may consist of an IAB-donor-CU-CP, multiple IAB-donor-CU-UPs
and multiple IAB-donor-DUs.

The IAB-node connects to an upstream IAB-node or an IAB-donor-DU via a
subset of the UE functionalities of the NR Uu interface (named IAB-MT
function of IAB-node). The IAB-node provides wireless backhaul to the
downstream IAB-nodes and UEs via the network functionalities of the NR
Uu interface (named IAB-DU function of IAB-node).

The F1-C traffic between an IAB-node and IAB-donor-CU is backhauled via
the IAB-donor-DU and the optional intermediate hop IAB-node(s).

The F1-U traffic between an IAB-node and IAB-donor-CU is backhauled via
the IAB-donor-DU and the optional intermediate hop IAB-node(s).

All functions specified for a gNB-DU are equally applicable for an
IAB-DU and IAB-donor-DU, unless otherwise stated, and all functions
specified for a gNB-CU are equally applicable for an IAB-donor-CU,
unless otherwise stated. All functions specified for the UE context are
equally applicable for managing the context of IAB-MT, unless otherwise
stated.

### 6.1.4 Protocol stacks of IAB

Figure 6.1.4-1 shows the protocol stack for F1-U between IAB-DU and the
IAB-donor-CU-UP, and Figure 6.1.4-2 shows the protocol stack for F1-C
between IAB-DU and the IAB-donor-CU-CP. In these example figures, F1-U
and F1-C traffic are carried over two backhaul hops.

NOTE: F1 needs to be security-protected as described in TS 33.501. The
security layer is not shown in the Figure 6.1.4-1, Figure 6.1.4-2 and
Figure 6.1.4-3.

IAB-donor-CU-CP, when the F1-C traffic is exchanged via the SgNB.

Fig. 6.1.4-5: Protocol stack for IAB F1-C traffic exchanged via the SgNB

### 6.1.5 Overall Architecture of NR MBS

The overall architecture specified in clause 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 applies for
NR MBS.

Upon establishment of a MBS Session resource by the 5GC, the gNB-CU
triggers the establishment of MRBs, involving the gNB-DU. If E1 is
deployed, the gNB-CU-CP triggers establishment of respective MBS UP
resources in the gNB-CU-UP.

The gNB-DU assigns the G-RNTI.

A shared F1-U tunnel is used between the gNB-CU and the gNB-DU forMRB
with PTM transmission. UE dedicated F1-U tunnels are used between the
gNB-CU and the gNB-DU for data transmission of PTP retransmission and
PTP forwarding of an MRB. For an MRB configured with PTP only
transmission either a shared F1-U or a UE dedicated F1-U tunnel is used,
dependent on the lower layer configuration. The gNB-DU assigns the DL
GTP-U TEID and provides it to the gNB-CU. If E1 is deployed the
gNB-CU-CP forwards it to the gNB-CU-UP.

For both broadcast and multicast, DL flow control maybe used for the
shared F1-U tunnel established for the MRB, as specified in TS 38.425
\[24\].

### 6.1.6 Protocol stacks of L2 UE-to-Network Relay

The protocol stacks for the user plane and control plane of L2 U2N Relay
architecture are described in Figure 6.1.6-1 and Figure 6.1.6-2,
respectively. The Uu SRAP is terminated between U2N relay UE and gNB-DU.

Figure 6.1.6-2: Control plane protocol stack for L2 UE-to-Network Relay

6.2 NG-RAN identifiers
----------------------

### 6.2.1 Principle of handling Application Protocol Identities

An Application Protocol Identity (AP ID) is allocated when a new
UE-associated logical connection is created in either an NG-RAN node or
an AMF. An AP ID shall uniquely identify a logical connection associated
to a UE over the NG interface or Xn interface within a node (NG-RAN node
or AMF) or over the F1 interface or over the E1 interface or over the W1
interface. Upon receipt of a message that has a new AP ID from the
sending node, the receiving node shall store the AP ID of the sending
node for the duration of the logical connection. The receiving node
shall assign the AP ID to be used to identify the logical connection
associated to the UE and include it as well as the previously received
new AP ID from the sending node, in the first returned message to the
sending node. In all subsequent messages to and from sending node, both
AP IDs of sending node and receiving node shall be included. For
MBS-associated logical connections of the E1 interface and the F1
interface the same principles for AP IDs apply as for UE-associated
logical connections.

The definitions of AP IDs as used on NG interface or Xn interface or F1
interface or E1 interface are shown below:

The RAN UE ID is an identifier allocated to a UE by the gNB-DU during UE
Initial Access or by the gNB-CU during UE Context Setup. It is
transferred over E1 and F1 interface, in order to do correlation of data
for a given UE in case of disaggregated gNB deployment. The RAN UE ID is
unique within a gNB.

6.3 Transport addresses
-----------------------

The transport layer address parameter is transported in the radio
network application signalling procedures that result in establishment
of transport bearer connections.

The transport layer address parameter shall not be interpreted in the
radio network application protocols and reveal the addressing format
used in the transport layer.

The formats of the transport layer addresses are further described in TS
38.414 \[5\], TS 38.424 \[6\] and TS 38.474 \[7\].

6.4 UE associations in NG-RAN Node
----------------------------------

There are several types of UE associations needed in the NG-RAN node:
the \"NG-RAN node UE context\" used to store all information needed for
a UE and the associations between the UE and the logical NG and Xn
connections used for NGAP/XnAP UE associated messages. An \"NG-RAN node
UE context\" exists for a UE in CM\_CONNECTED.

**Definitions:**

**NG-RAN node UE context:**

An NG-RAN node UE context is a block of information in an NG-RAN node
associated to one UE. The block of information contains the necessary
information required to maintain the NG-RAN services towards the active
UE. An NG-RAN node UE context is established when the transition to RRC
CONNECTED for a UE is completed or in the target NG-RAN node after
completion of handover resource allocation during handover preparation,
in which case at least UE state information, security information, UE
capability information and the identities of the UE-associated logical
NG-connection shall be included in the NG-RAN node UE context.

For Dual Connectivity an NG-RAN node UE context is also established in
the S-NG-RAN node after completion of S-NG-RAN node Addition Preparation
procedure.

If radio bearers are requested to be setup during a UE Context setup or
modification procedure, the UE capabilities are signalled to the
receiving node as part of the UE context setup or modification
procedures.

**Bearer context:**

A bearer context is a block of information in a gNB-CU-UP node
associated to one UE that is used for the sake of communication over the
E1 interface. It may include the information about data radio bearers,
PDU sessions and QoS-flows associated to the UE. The block of
information contains the necessary information required to maintain
user-plane services toward the UE.

**UE-associated logical NG/Xn/F1/E1-connection:**

NGAP, XnAP, F1AP and E1AP provide means to exchange control plane
messages associated with the UE over the respectively NG-C, Xn-C, F1-C
or E1 interface.

A UE-associated logical connection is established during the first
NGAP/XnAP/F1AP message exchange between the NG/Xn/F1 peer nodes.

The connection is maintained as long as UE associated NG/XnAP/F1AP
messages need to be exchanged over the NG/Xn/F1 interface.

The UE-associated logical NG-connection uses the identities AMF UE NGAP
ID and RAN UE NGAP ID.

The UE-associated logical Xn-connection uses the identities Old NG-RAN
node UE XnAP ID and New NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID, or Source NG-RAN node UE
XnAP ID and Target NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID, or M-NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID
and S-NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID.

The UE-associated logical F1-connection uses the identities gNB-CU UE
F1AP ID and gNB-DU UE F1AP ID.

The UE-associated logical E1-connection uses the identities gNB-CU-CP UE
E1AP ID and gNB-CU-UP UE E1AP ID.

When a node (AMF or gNB) receives a UE associated NGAP/XnAP/F1AP/E1AP
message the node retrieves the associated UE based on the
NGAP/XnAP/F1AP/E1AP ID.

**UE-associated signalling:**

UE-associated signalling is an exchange of NGAP/XnAP/F1AP/E1AP messages
associated with one UE over the UE-associated logical
NG/Xn/F1/E1-connection.

NOTE1: The UE-associated logical NG-connection may exist before the
NG-RAN node UE context is setup in the NG-RAN node.

NOTE2: The UE-associated logical F1-connection may exist before the UE
context is setup in the gNB-DU.

NOTE3: The general principle described in this clause also applies to
ng-eNB and W1/E1 interface, if not explicitly specified otherwise.

6.5 MBS Session associations in NG-RAN Node
-------------------------------------------

The following MBS Session associations are defined in the NG-RAN node to
support NR MBS:

**NG-RAN MBS session resource context:** Encompasses CP and UP,
transport and radio resources to support an MBS Session. For multicast
it also encompasses the MBS Session state (active, de-activated) and
information about joined UEs. If an MBS session resource within a gNB
serves multiple MBS service areas, as specified in TS 23.247 \[27\] the
same NG RAN MBS session resource context may be associated with multiple
NG-U resources. For a multicast MBS session, NG-U resources are setup or
released by the gNB upon UE mobility or UEs leaving or joining the
multicast MBS session.

**MBS Session context in a gNB-DU:**

The definition of an MBS Session context in a gNB-DU applicable for
broadcast and multicast.

An MBS Session context in a gNB-DU

\- is a block of information associated to an MBS Session, which may
consist of one or several MRB Contexts;

\- corresponds to either one or several F1-U tunnels.

**MRB Context in a gNB-DU:**

An MRB Context is a block of information in a gNB-DU associated to an
MRB (MRB "instance"). The gNB-DU sets up resources for each MRB Context
in a gNB-DU associated to an MBS Session context

\- based on information provided within MBS Session Context related
information as received by the gNB-DU (e.g. MRB QoS, MBS service area
information, etc.), and,

\- for multicast, based on the UE Contexts established for
RRC\_CONNECTED UEs within the gNB-DU containing joining information of
the UE for the respective multicast session.

\- for broadcast, the gNB-DU determines whether F1-U tunnels are setup
per gNB-DU or per MBS Area Session ID served by the gNB-DU.

\- for multicast, the gNB-DU determines whether F1-U tunnels are setup
per gNB-DU or per cell served by the DU or per MBS Area Session ID
served by the gNB-DU or for ptp restransmissions or for a ptp-only MRB
leg.

For multicast, for each MRB, the gNB-DU provides the MRB specific Uu
configuration to the gNB-CU to configure the UE.

**Multicast F1-U Context:**

A Multicast F1-U Context is a block of information in a gNB-DU to
control the F1-U tunnels associated to the MRB Contexts established for
a multicast MBS session. A Multicast F1-U Context is either established
per gNB-DU or per cell served by the gNB-DU or per MBS Area Session ID
served by the gNB-DU or for ptp restransmissions or for ptp forwarding
or for a ptp-only MRB leg. Several Multicast F1-U contexts may exist in
parallel in a gNB-DU for the same multicast MBS session.

**Allocation and usage of MRB ID values on NG-RAN interfaces for
multicast MBS sessions:**

\- F1 interface: an MRB ID signalled on an F1 interface instance
identifies uniquely an MRB among all MRB contexts in an gNB-DU,
allocated for all active multicast MBS sessions served by that gNB-DU.
The value of each MRB ID is the same value as communicated to UEs served
by that gNB-DU.

\- E1 interface: an MRB ID signalled on an E1 interface instance
identifies uniquely an MRB among all MRBs allocated for a multicast MBS
session.

\- Xn interface, NG interface: MRB IDs are signalled on Xn/NG interfaces
for providing MBS QoS flow to MRB mapping information and data
forwarding information from the source gNB. The value of the MRB ID
signalled on the Xn/NG interface is the same value as communicated to
UEs at the source cell.

**Allocation and usage of MRB ID values on NG-RAN interfaces for
broadcast MBS sessions:**

\- An MRB ID signalled on NG-RAN interfaces identifies uniquely an MRB
among all MRBs allocated for a broadcast MBS sesssion.

**MBS-associated logical F1/E1-connection:**

F1AP and E1AP provide means to exchange control plane messages
associated with an MBS session over the respective F1/E1 interface.

An MBS-associated logical connection is established during the first
F1AP/E1AP message exchange between the F1/E1 peer nodes.

The connection is maintained as long as MBS associated F1AP/E1AP
messages need to be exchanged over the F1/E1 interface.

The MBS-associated logical F1-connection uses the identities gNB-CU MBS
F1AP ID and gNB-DU MBS F1AP ID.

The MBS-associated logical E1-connection uses the identities gNB-CU-CP
MBS E1AP ID and gNB-CU-UP MBS E1AP ID.

When a node (DU or CU or CU-CP and CU-UP) receives an MBS associated
F1AP/E1AP message the node retrieves the associated MBS session based on
the F1AP/E1AP ID.

**MBS-associated signalling:**

MBS-associated signalling is an exchange of F1AP/E1AP messages
associated with one MBS session over the MBS-associated logical
F1/E1-connection.

7 NG-RAN functions description
==============================

7.0 General
-----------

For the list of functions refer to TS 38.300 \[2\].

7.1 NG-RAN sharing
------------------

NG-RAN supports radio access network sharing as specified in TS 23.501
\[3\] and TS 38.300 \[2\] and TS 36.300 \[19\].

7.2 Remote Interference Management
----------------------------------

The Remote Interference Management function in non-split gNB case is
specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

In case of split gNB architecture, in the victim set, a gNB-DU detects
the remote interference. If remote interference is detected, the gNB-DU
can send out the RIM-RS. In the aggressor set, if a gNB-DU detects the
RIM-RS sent by the victim gNB(s), it sends to the gNB-CU the RIM-RS
detection status and the victim Set ID. The gNB-CU acts as a coordinator
on behalf of its affiliated gNB-DUs, where the gNB-CU merges the
outgoing RIM information received from its gNB-DUs in the aggressor set
and forwards the merged information to all the gNBs in the victim set.

Similarly, in the victim set, the gNB-CU distributes the incoming RIM
information to all the gNB-DUs in the set, as indicated in the RIM
information received from the aggressor set.

In addition, to facilitate consolidation of RIM information, the gNB-DU
provides the associated aggressor set ID and the victim set ID of each
serving cell to the gNB-CU.

7.3 Cross-Link Interference Management
--------------------------------------

The Cross-Link Interference Management function in non-split gNB case is
specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

In case of split gNB architecture, the gNB-CU forwards the TDD DL/UL
patterns received from neighboring nodes to each concerned gNB-DU. The
gNB-DU reports the TDD DL/UL patterns of its serving cells to the gNB-CU
if Cross-Link Interference is detected.

7.4 Support for Non-Public Networks
-----------------------------------

NG-RAN supports NPN as specified in TS 23.501 \[3\] and TS 38.300 \[2\].

7.5 RACH Optimisation Function
------------------------------

The RACH Optimization Function in non-split gNB case is specified in TS
38.300 \[2\].

In case of split gNB architecture, RACH configuration conflict detection
and resolution function is located at the gNB-DU. To perform RACH
optimisation at gNB-DU, gNB-CU sends the RA Report retrieved from the
UE(s) to gNB-DU via F1AP signalling. The gNB-DU signals the PRACH
configuration per-cell to gNB-CU. The gNB-CU may forward a limited set
of neighbour cell's PRACH configurations received from neighbour gNBs
and other gNB-DUs to the gNB-DU to resolve the configuration conflict.

**RA Report retrieval**

When a UE performs successful random access attempts which are only
known by the gNB-DU (e.g., beam failure recovery*,* UL synchronization
issue*,* scheduling request failure, no PUCCH resource available), the
gNB-DU may inform the gNB-CU about the occurrences of successful random
access procedures in the gNB-DU via a RACH indication. The gNB-CU may
then retrieve the RA Report from the UE(s) based on the RACH indication
received via F1AP signalling from the gNB-DU.

7.6 Positioning
---------------

The NG-RAN supports the positioning functionality as specified in TS
38.305 \[25\].

7.7 Support for NR MBS
----------------------

The Support of NR MBS in non-split gNB case is specified in TS 38.300
\[2\].

### 7.7.1 Support of dynamic PTP and PTM switching

For UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED, NG-RAN supports dynamic switch between PTP
and PTM for a multicast MBS session as specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

In case of split gNB architecture, for a MRB with common PDCP involving
both PTP (RLC leg) and PTM (RLC leg), upon receiving the MBS data from
the gNB-CU via a shared F1-U tunnel, the gNB-DU makes decision of using
PTP (RLC leg) or PTM (RLC leg) or both.

For UEs in RRC\_INACTIVE only PTM is supported for a multicast MBS
session as specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

### 7.7.2 Support of resource efficiency for RAN Sharing

#### 7.7.2.1 General

Resource efficiency for RAN sharing is supported in both MOCN scenario
and multiple cell-ID broadcast scenario.

In case of split gNB,

\- for each broadcast MBS session, the gNB-CU triggers the establishment
of a Broadcast MBS Session Context over the F1 interface regardless of
whether F1-U or NG-U resources associated with the broadcast MBS session
are established.

#### 7.7.2.2 Support of resource efficiency for MOCN

The Associated Session ID is used to enable identifying broadcast MBS
sessions for which RAN resources could be shared by the involved gNB-DUs
and the gNB-CU-UP and is provided by the gNB-CU-CP. For location
dependent MBS services, the MBS Service Area provided by the gNB-CU-CP
is also taken into account. Only one set of shared F1-U resources is
established and kept as long as there is one PLMN keeping the MBS
Broadcast service.

#### 7.7.2.3 Support of resource efficiency for RAN Sharing with multiple cell-ID broadcast

gNB-DUs sharing the same physical cell resources receive via F1-C
information to enable identifying broadcast MBS sessions providing
identical content. The identification is based on Associated Session ID
and, for location dependent MBS services, the MBS Service Area is also
taken into account.

While applying resource efficiency for RAN Sharing with multiple cell-ID
broadcast

\- the entity controlling the involved gNB-DUs sharing the same physical
cell resources resolve different QoS requirements and slicing
information received from the involved gNB-CUs in an implementation
specific way.

\- F1-U resources are established towards either all involved gNB-CUs or
only some of them which is decided by the entity controlling the
involved gNB-DUs sharing the same physical cell resources. The gNB-DU is
able to trigger the gNB-CU to establish F1-U resources.

\- the gNB-CU-CP takes into account the decision to establish F1-U
resources to decide whether to establish NG-U resources.

If a broadcast MBS session is released by a 5GC but kept by other
5GC(s), for an MBS Session Context not associated with any user plane
resource,

\- F1AP supports triggering the setup of F1-U resources by the gNB-DU by
means of the Broadcast Transport Resource Request procedure.

\- NGAP supports triggering the setup NG-U resources by the gNB by means
of the Broadcast Session Transport procedure for unicast transport.

### 7.7.3 Support of Multicast reception for UEs in RRC\_INACTIVE

F1AP supports:

\- enabling and disabling multicast reception for UEs in RRC\_INACTIVE
state for a specific multicast MBS session on cell level.

> \- retrieval of PTM configuration information from the gNB-DU by means
> of the gNB-CU triggered Multicast Context Modification procedure.

\- keeping the gNB-CU updated with the latest PTM configuration by means
of the gNB-DU initiated Multicast Context Notification procedure.

The gNB-CU decides whether multicast reception in RRC\_INACTIVE state is
applied.

### 7.7.4 Recovery of shared F1-U Failure 

Recovery of shared F1-U failure is supported for broadcast MBS sessions
with the gNB-DU detecting the F1-U failure and triggering recovery
handling. If the gNB-DU detects failure of a shared F1-U bearer of a
broadcast MBS session it may send the F1AP Broadcast Transport Resource
Request message to the gNB-CU CP indicating the F1-U failure and
optionally including a new DL F1-U transport address. The gNB-CU CP
should understand that any shared F1-U resources previously established
for the broadcast MBS session have been implicitly released by the
gNB-DU.

The gNB-CU CP should then:

\- trigger towards gNB-CU UP the release of the current gNB-CU UP UL
transport resources of the shared F1-U bearer and establishment of new
ones and the provision of the new DL F1-U transport addresses if
received;

\- trigger the F1AP Broadcast Context Modification procedure to deliver
the corresponding new gNB-CU UP address to the gNB-DU to establish the
new F1-U resources.

7.8 PCI Optimisation Function
-----------------------------

The PCI Optimization Function in non-split gNB case is specified in TS
38.300 \[2\].

In split gNB architecture, the OAM configures a PCI for each NR cell to
the gNB-DU.

For centralized PCI assignment in split gNB architecture, the gNB-CU
detects PCI conflict of NR cells and reports the NR cells suffering PCI
conflict to OAM directly. The OAM is in charge of reassigning a new PCI
for the NR cell subject to PCI conflict.

For distributed PCI assignment in split gNB architecture, the OAM
assigns a list of PCIs for each NR cell and sends the configured PCI
list to the gNB-CU. If the gNB-CU detects PCI conflict, the gNB-CU may
select a new PCI value from the preconfigured PCI list for the NR cell
and send it to the gNB-DU by either F1 Setup procedure or gNB-CU
configuration update procedure.

For mobile IAB deployments, the legacy mechanisms can be reused for PCI
collision detection. The PCI space can be partitioned between mobile IAB
cells and stationary cells by implementation.

7.9 Support for CCO
-------------------

### 7.9.1 General

The NR Capacity and Coverage Optimization (CCO) Function in non-split
gNB case is specified in TS 38.300 \[2\]. The objective of this function
is to detect and mitigate coverage and cell edge interference issues.

### 7.9.2 OAM requirements

Each gNB-DU may be configured with *alternative coverage configurations*
by OAM. The alternative coverage configurations contain relevant radio
parameters and may also include a range for how each parameter is
allowed to be adjusted.

### 7.9.3 Dynamic coverage configuration changes

In case of split gNB architecture, CCO detection function is located at
the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU signals to the gNB-DU the CCO issue and the
affected cells and beams. The gNB-DU resolves the CCO issue concerning
own served cell by local action within the OAM configured limits. The
gNB-DU may also take into account information received for other cells
when adopting the CCO configuration. The gNB-DU informs the gNB-CU of
the new coverage states adopted.

7.10 Support of RAN visible QoE measurement
-------------------------------------------

The RAN visible QoE measurement function is specified in TS 38.300
\[2\].

In split gNB architecture, upon the reception of the RAN visible QoE
measurement report from the UE, the gNB-CU may forward the corresponding
QoE information to the gNB-DU. The QoE information transferred to the
gNB-DU may include the RAN visible QoE measurement results received from
the UE, along with the corresponding DRB ID(s).

The gNB-DU may deactivate the transfer of RAN visible QoE measurement
results from the gNB-CU, by initiating QoE Information Transfer Control
procedure towards the gNB-CU.

7.11 Support of AI/ML for NG-RAN
--------------------------------

The support of AI/ML for NG-RAN is specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

*In case of CU-DU split architecture, the following scenarios may be
supported:*

\- AI/ML Model Training is located in the OAM and AI/ML Model Inference
is located in the gNB-CU.

\- AI/ML Model Training and Model Inference are both located in the
gNB-CU.

8 Overall procedures in gNB-CU/gNB-DU Architecture
==================================================

8.1 UE Initial Access
---------------------

The signalling flow for UE Initial access is shown in Figure 8.1-1.

Figure 8.1-1: UE Initial Access procedure

1\. The UE sends an *RRCSetupRequest* message to the gNB-DU.

2\. The gNB-DU includes the RRC message and, if the UE is admitted, the
corresponding low layer configuration for the UE in the INITIAL UL RRC
MESSAGE TRANSFER message and transfers to the gNB-CU. The INITIAL UL RRC
MESSAGE TRANSFER message includes the C-RNTI allocated by the gNB-DU. If
the gNB-DU identifies the UE as a Reduced Capability UE during the
random access procedure, a NR RedCap UE Indication or a NR eRedCap UE
Indication is provided in the INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message.

3\. The gNB-CU allocates a gNB-CU UE F1AP ID for the UE and generates a
*RRCSetup* message towards UE. The RRC message is encapsulated in -the
DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message.

4\. The gNB-DU sends the *RRCSetup* message to the UE.

5\. The UE sends the RRC CONNECTION SETUP COMPLETE message to the
gNB-DU.

6\. The gNB-DU encapsulates the RRC message in the UL RRC MESSAGE
TRANSFER message and sends it to the gNB-CU.

7\. The gNB-CU sends the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message to the AMF.

8\. The AMF sends the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the
gNB-CU.

9\. The gNB-CU sends the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to establish
the UE context in the gNB-DU. In this message, it may also encapsulate
the *SecurityModeCommand* message. In case of NG-RAN sharing, the gNB-CU
includes the serving PLMN ID (for SNPNs the serving SNPN ID).

10\. The gNB-DU sends the *SecurityModeCommand* message to the UE.

11\. The gNB-DU sends the UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message to the
gNB-CU.

12\. The UE responds with the *SecurityModeComplete* message.

13\. The gNB-DU encapsulates the RRC message in the UL RRC MESSAGE
TRANSFER message and sends it to the gNB-CU.

14\. The gNB-CU generates the *RRCReconfiguration* message and
encapsulates it in the DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message.

15\. The gNB-DU sends *RRCReconfiguration* message to the UE.

16\. The UE sends *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message to the gNB-DU.

17\. The gNB-DU encapsulates the RRC message in the UL RRC MESSAGE
TRANSFER message and send it to the gNB-CU.

18\. The gNB-CU sends the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message to the
AMF.

8.2 Intra-gNB-CU Mobility
-------------------------

### 8.2.1 Intra-NR Mobility

#### 8.2.1.1 Inter-gNB-DU Mobility

This procedure is used for the case when the UE moves from one gNB-DU to
another gNB-DU within the same gNB-CU during NR operation. Figure
8.2.1.1-1 shows the inter-gNB-DU mobility procedure for intra-NR.

Figure 8.2.1.1-1: Inter-gNB-DU Mobility for intra-NR

1\. The UE sends a *MeasurementReport* message to the source gNB-DU.

2\. The source gNB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the
gNB-CU to convey the received *MeasurementReport* message.

2a. The gNB-CU may send an UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to
the source gNB-DU to query the latest configuration.

2b. The source gNB-DU responds with an UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message that includes full configuration information.

3\. The gNB-CU sends an UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the target
gNB-DU to create an UE context and setup one or more data bearers. The
UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message includes a
HandoverPreparationInformation. In case of NG-RAN sharing, the gNB-CU
includes the serving PLMN ID (for SNPNs the serving SNPN ID).

4\. The target gNB-DU responds to the gNB-CU with an UE CONTEXT SETUP
RESPONSE message.

5\. The gNB-CU sends a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the
source gNB-DU, which includes a generated *RRCReconfiguration* message
and indicates to stop the data transmission for the UE. The source
gNB-DU also sends a Downlink Data Delivery Status frame to inform the
gNB-CU about the unsuccessfully transmitted downlink data to the UE.

NOTE 1: In case of DAPS Handover, the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST
message in step 5 may indicate to stop the data transmission only for
the DRB(s) not subject to DAPS Handover or may not indicate to stop the
data transmission at all. Instead, the DL RRC Message Transfer procedure
can be used to carry the handover command to the UE. The UE CONTEXT
MODIFICATION REQUEST message that indicates to stop the data
transmission for the UE is sent to the source gNB-DU once the gNB-CU
knows that the UE has successfully accessed the target gNB-DU, for which
the source gNB-DU sends a DDDS frame about the unsuccessfully
transmitted downlink data to the gNB-CU.

6\. The source gNB-DU forwards the received *RRCReconfiguration* message
to the UE.

7\. The source gNB-DU responds to the gNB-CU with the UE CONTEXT
MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.

8\. A Random Access procedure is performed at the target gNB-DU. The
target gNB-DU sends a Downlink Data Delivery Status frame to inform the
gNB-CU. Downlink packets, which may include PDCP PDUs not successfully
transmitted in the source gNB-DU, are sent from the gNB-CU to the target
gNB-DU.

NOTE 2: It is up to gNB-CU implementation whether to start sending DL
User Data to gNB-DU before or after reception of the Downlink Data
Delivery Status.

9\. The UE responds to the target gNB-DU with an
*RRCReconfigurationComplete* message.

10\. The target gNB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the
gNB-CU to convey the received *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message.
Downlink packets are sent to the UE. Also, uplink packets are sent from
the UE, which are forwarded to the gNB-CU through the target gNB-DU.

11\. The gNB-CU sends an UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the
source gNB-DU.

12\. The source gNB-DU releases the UE context and responds the gNB-CU
with an UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message.

#### 8.2.1.2 Intra-gNB-DU handover

This procedure is used for the case that the UE moves from one cell to
another cell within the same gNB-DU or for the case that intra-cell
handover is performed during NR operation, and supported by the UE
Context Modification (gNB-CU initiated) procedure as specified in TS
38.473 \[4\]. When the intra-gNB-DU handover is performed (either
inter-cell or intra-cell), the gNB-CU provides new UL GTP TEID to the
gNB-DU and the gNB-DU provides new DL GTP TEID to the gNB-CU. The gNB-DU
shall continue sending UL PDCP PDUs to the gNB-CU using the previous UL
GTP TEID until it re-establishes the RLC, and after then start sending
using the new UL GTP TEID. The gNB-CU shall continue sending DL PDCP
PDUs to the gNB-DU using the previous DL GTP TEID until it performs PDCP
re-establishment or PDCP data recovery, and after then start sending
using the new DL GTP TEID.

#### 8.2.1.3 Inter-gNB-DU Conditional Handover or Conditional PSCell Change or subsequent CPAC

This procedure is used for the case when the UE moves from one gNB-DU to
another gNB-DU within the same gNB-CU during NR operation for
conditional handover or conditional PSCell change or subsequent CPAC.
Figure 8.2.1.3-1 shows the inter-gNB-DU conditional mobility procedure
for intra-NR.

Figure 8.2.1.3-1: Inter-gNB-DU Conditional Handover or Conditional
PSCell Change or subsequent CPAC for intra-NR

1-2. The steps 1-2 are as defined in clause 8.2.1.1.

3\. The gNB-CU sends an UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the
candidate gNB-DU to create an UE context and setup one or more data
bearers. The UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message is sent for each candidate
cell and includes a HandoverPreparationInformation (conditional
handover) or a CG-ConfigInfo (conditional PSCell change or subsequent
CPAC).

4\. The candidate gNB-DU responds to the gNB-CU with an UE CONTEXT SETUP
RESPONSE message including the *target cell ID that was requested from
the gNB-CU. The response message is sent for each requested candidate
cell.*

5\. The gNB-CU sends a DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the source
gNB-DU, which includes a generated *RRCReconfiguration* message.

6\. The step 6 is as defined in clause 8.2.1.1.

7-8. The UE responds to the source gNB-DU with an
*RRCReconfigurationComplete* message, for which the source gNB-DU
forwards to the gNB-CU via an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message.

9\. An execution condition to trigger initiation of conditional handover
or conditional PSCell change or subsequent CPAC is fulfilled.

10\. A Random Access procedure is performed at the candidate gNB-DU,
which becomes the target gNB-DU if successful. The target gNB-DU sends a
Downlink Data Delivery Status frame to inform the gNB-CU. The target

the UE. Downlink packets, which may include PDCP PDUs not successfully
transmitted in the source gNB-DU, are sent from the gNB-CU to the target
gNB-DU.

NOTE 1: The step 13 may happen before step 12, as soon as the gNB-CU

### 8.2.2 EN-DC Mobility

#### 8.2.2.1 Inter-gNB-DU Mobility using MCG SRB

This procedure is used for the case the UE moves from one gNB-DU to
another gNB-DU within the same gNB-CU when only MCG SRB is available
during EN-DC operation. Figure 8.2.2.1-1 shows the inter-gNB-DU mobility

gNB-CU. Downlink packets, which may include PDCP PDUs not successfully
transmitted in the source gNB-DU, are sent from the gNB-CU to the target
gNB-DU. Downlink packets are sent to the UE. Also, uplink packets are
sent from the UE, which are forwarded to the gNB-CU through the target
gNB-DU.

NOTE: It is up to gNB-CU implementation whether to start sending DL User
Data to gNB-DU before or after reception of the Downlink Data Delivery
Status.

15\. The gNB-CU sends an UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the
source gNB-DU.

16\. The source gNB-DU releases the UE context and responds the gNB-CU
with an UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message.

#### 8.2.2.2 Inter-gNB-DU Mobility using SCG SRB (SRB3)

This procedure is used for the case the UE moves from one gNB-DU to
another gNB-DU when SCG SRB (SRB3) is available during EN-DC operation.
The procedure is the same as inter-gNB-DU Mobility for intra-NR as
defined in clause 8.2.1.1 but the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message
includes a CG-ConfigInfo.

#### 8.2.2.3 Inter-gNB-DU Conditional PSCell Change using MCG SRB without MN negotiation

This procedure is used for the case where the UE moves from one gNB-DU

### 8.2.3 Intra-CU topology adaptation procedure

#### 8.2.3.1 Intra-CU topology adaptation procedure in SA

During the intra-CU topology adaptation in SA, both the source and the
target parent node are served by the same IAB-donor-CU. The target
parent node may use a different IAB-donor-DU than the source parent
node. The source path may have common nodes with the target path. Figure
8.2.3.1-1 shows an example of the topology adaptation procedure, where
the target parent node uses a different IAB-donor-DU than the one used
by the source parent node.

Figure 8.2.3.1-1: IAB intra-CU topology adaptation procedure

1\. The migrating IAB-MT sends a *MeasurementReport* message to the
source parent node IAB-DU. This report is based on a Measurement
Configuration the migrating IAB-MT received from the IAB-donor-CU
before.

2\. The source parent node IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message to the IAB-donor-CU to convey the received *MeasurementReport*.

3\. The IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the
target parent node IAB-DU to create the UE context for the migrating
IAB-MT and set up one or more bearers. These bearers can be used by the
migrating IAB-MT for its own signalling, and, optionally, data traffic.

4\. The target parent node IAB-DU responds to the IAB-donor-CU with a UE
CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.

5\. The IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to
the source parent node IAB-DU, which includes a generated
*RRCReconfiguration* message. The *RRCReconfiguration* message includes
a default BH RLC channel and a default BAP Routing ID configuration for
UL F1-C/non-F1 traffic mapping on the target path. It may include
additional BH RLC channels. **This step may also include allocation of
TNL address(es) that is (are) routable via the target IAB-donor-DU. The
new TNL address(es) may be included in the** *RRCReconfiguration*
message as a replacement for the TNL address(es) that is (are) routable
via the source IAB-donor-DU. In case IPsec tunnel mode is used to
protect the F1 and non-F1 traffic, the allocated TNL address is outer IP
address. **The TNL address replacement is not necessary if the source
and target paths use the same IAB-donor-DU.** The *Transmission Action
Indicator* in the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message indicates to
stop the data transmission to the migrating IAB-node.

6\. The source parent node IAB-DU forwards the received
*RRCReconfiguration* message to the migrating IAB-MT.

7\. The source parent node IAB-DU responds to the IAB-donor-CU with the
UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.

8\. A Random Access procedure is performed at the target parent node
IAB-DU.

9\. The migrating IAB-MT responds to the target parent node IAB-DU with
an *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message.

10\. The target parent node IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message to the IAB-donor-CU to convey the received
*RRCReconfigurationComplete* message. Also, uplink packets can be sent
from the migrating IAB-MT, which are forwarded to the IAB-donor-CU
through the target parent node IAB-DU. These UL packets belong to the
IAB-MT's own signalling and, optionally, data traffic.

**11. The** IAB-donor-CU **configures BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer
routing entries on the target path between the target parent IAB-node
and target IAB-donor-DU** as well as DL mappings on the target
IAB-donor-DU for the migrating IAB-node's target path**. These
configurations may be performed at an earlier stage, e.g. immediately
after step 3**, or before step 3**.** The IAB-donor-CU may establish
additional BH RLC channels to the migrating IAB-MT via RRC message.

**12. The** F1-C connections are switched to use the migrating
IAB-node's new TNL address(es), IAB-donor-CU updates the UL BH
information associated to each GTP-tunnel to migrating IAB-node. This
step may also update UL FTEID and DL FTEID associated to each
GTP-tunnel. All F1-U tunnels are switched to use the migrating
IAB-node's new TNL address(es). This step may use non-UE associated
signaling in E1 and/or F1 interface to provide updated UP configuration
for F1-U tunnels of multiple connected UEs or child IAB-MTs. The
IAB-donor-CU may also update the UL BH information associated with
non-UP traffic. Implementation must ensure the avoidance of potential
race conditions, i.e. no conflicting configurations are concurrently
performed using UE-associated and non-UE-associated procedures.

In case IPsec tunnel mode is used for TNL protection, the IAB-node may
use MOBIKE (IETF RFC 4555 \[29\]) to migrate the IPsec tunnel to the new
IP outer addresses. After the completion of the MOBIKE procedure, the
IAB-DU initiates an F1AP gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure from
which the IAB-donor-CU can conclude whether the existing inner IP
address(es) (e.g. for SCTP association) and the DL F-TEID can be reused.

If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP
association(s) between the migrating IAB-node and the IAB-donor-CU may
be established using the new TNL address information of the migrating
IAB-node. The migrating IAB-node sends an F1AP gNB-DU CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message to the IAB-donor-CU, which may include new (outer) IP
addresses and corresponding new (inner) IP address for the F1-U traffic
to be switched to the target path.

13\. The IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the
source parent node IAB-DU.

14\. The source parent node IAB-DU releases the migrating IAB-MT's
context and responds to the IAB-donor-CU with a UE CONTEXT RELEASE
COMPLETE message.

**15.** The IAB-donor-CU releases BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer
routing entries on the source path between source parent IAB-node and
source IAB-donor-DU.

NOTE 1: In case that the source path and target path have common nodes,
the BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer routing entries of those nodes may
not need to be released in Step 15.

Steps 11, 12 and 15 should also be performed for the migrating
IAB-node's descendant nodes, as follows:

The IAB-donor-CU may allocate new TNL address(es) that is (are) routable
via the target IAB-donor-DU to the descendent nodes via
*RRCReconfiguration* message.

If needed, the IAB-donor-CU may also provide a new default UL mapping
which includes a default BH RLC channel and a default BAP Routing ID for
UL F1-C/non-F1 traffic on the target path, to the descendant nodes via
*RRCReconfiguration* message.

If needed, the IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels, BAP-sublayer
routing entries and BH RLC channel mappings on the target path for the
descendant nodes in the same manner as described for the migrating
IAB-node in step 11.

The descendant nodes switch their F1-C connections and F1-U tunnels to
new TNL addresses that are anchored at the new IAB-donor-DU, in the same
manner as described for the migrating IAB-node in step 12.

Based on implementation, these steps can be performed after or in
parallel with the handover of the migrating IAB-node.

To enable performing these steps in parallel, the IAB-donor-CU sends the
RRCReconfiguration message with the new TNL address(es) and the new
default BAP configuration to the descendent node while the migrating
IAB-MT is still connected with source parent node, for example, before
Step 5. In this case, the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message
carrying this RRCReconfiguration message includes a conditional delivery
indication for the descendent node's parent IAB-DU. Based on this
indication, the parent IAB-DU retains the RRCReconfiguration message
until the conditions for delivery are met, as specified in TS 38.473
\[4\]. The IAB-donor-CU may further configure the BAP-sublayer routing
entries on the migrating IAB-node and the descendant nodes while the
migrating IAB-MT is still connected with the source parent node.

NOTE 2: In upstream direction, in-flight packets between the source
parent node and the IAB-donor-CU can be delivered even after the target
path is established.

NOTE 3: In-flight downlink data in the source path may be discarded, up
to implementation via the NR user plane protocol (TS 38.425 \[24\]).

NOTE 4: The IAB-donor-CU can determine the unsuccessfully transmitted
downlink data over the backhaul link by implementation.

#### 8.2.3.2 Intra-CU topology adaptation procedure in NSA using MCG SRB

This procedure is used when the migrating IAB-MT moves from source
parent node to target parent node within the same IAB-donor-CU while
only MCG SRB is available for IAB-node during EN-DC operation. The
target parent node may use a different IAB-donor-DU than the one used by
the source parent node. The source path may have common nodes with the
target path. Figure 8.2.3.2-1 shows the topology adaptation procedure
using MCG SRB of IAB-MT in EN-DC, where the target parent node uses a
different IAB-donor-DU than the source parent node.

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: IAB intra-CU topology adaptation procedure using MCG
SRB in EN-DC

1\. The migrating IAB-MT sends an *ULInformationTransferMRDC* message to
the MeNB

2\. The MeNB sends RRC TRANSFER message to the IAB-donor-CU.

3\. The IAB-donor-CU may send UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to
the source parent node IAB-DU, to query the latest SCG configuration.

4\. The source parent node IAB-DU responds with a UE CONTEXT
MODIFICATION RESPONSE message that includes full configuration
information.

5\. The IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the
target parent node IAB-DU, to create a UE context for migrating IAB-MT
and set up one or more bearers. These bearers can be used by the
migrating IAB-MT for its own signalling, and, optionally, data traffic.
The UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message includes *CG-ConfigInfo*.

6\. The target parent node IAB-DU responds to the IAB-donor-CU with a UE
CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.

7\. The IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to
the source parent node IAB-DU, this message includes the *Transmission
Action Indicator* IE, which instructs the source parent node IAB-DU to
stop the data transmission to the migrating IAB-node. The source parent
node IAB-DU also sends a Downlink Data Delivery Status frame to inform
the IAB-donor-CU about the unsuccessfully transmitted downlink data to
the migrating IAB-node.

8\. The source parent node IAB-DU responds to the IAB-donor-CU with a UE
CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.

9\. The IAB-donor-CU sends an SGNB MODIFICATION REQUIRED message to the
MeNB.

10/11. The MeNB initiated SgNB Modification procedure may be triggered
by the SgNB initiated SgNB Modification procedure (e.g. to provide
information such as data forwarding addresses, new SN security key,
measurement gap, etc.).

12\. The MeNB and the migrating IAB-MT perform RRC Connection
Reconfiguration procedure. The *RRCConnectionReconfiguration* message
includes information as described for the intra-CU topology adaptation
procedure in SA in clause 8.2.3.1.

13\. The MeNB sends an SGNB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message to the
IAB-donor-CU.

14\. The migrating IAB-MT performs Random Access procedure at the target
parent node IAB-DU.

15-19. The remaining steps of the procedure follow the steps 11-15 of
the intra-CU topology adaptation procedure in SA scenario, as defined in
clause 8.2.3.1. The main difference is that the RRC message for the
migrating IAB-node, if involved, will be transmitted using the MCG SRB.

#### 8.2.3.3 Intra-CU topology adaptation procedure in NSA using SCG SRB (SRB3)

This procedure is used when the migrating IAB-MT moves from source
parent node to target parent node within the same IAB-donor-CU, when SCG
SRB (SRB3) is available for IAB-node during EN-DC operation. The target
parent node may use a different IAB-donor-DU than the source parent
node. The source path may have common nodes with the target path. The
procedure is the same as intra-CU topology adaptation procedure in SA
scenario as defined in clause 8.2.3.1 but the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
message includes *CG-ConfigInfo* in step 3.

### 8.2.4 Intra-CU topological redundancy procedure

The intra-CU topological redundancy procedure enables the establishment
and release of redundant paths in the IAB-topology underneath the same
IAB-donor-CU. The redundant paths may use different IAB-donor-DUs. They
may also have common intermediate nodes. Since topological redundancy
uses NR-DC for the IAB-MT, it is only supported for IAB-nodes operating
in SA mode.

Figure 8.2.4-1 shows an example for an IAB topology, where one IAB-node,
referred to as the *dual-connecting* IAB-node, has two paths towards the
IAB-donor via different IAB-donor-DUs.

Figure 8.2.4-1: Example for IAB topology with two redundant paths

Figure 8.2.4-2: Procedure for establishment of redundant path in IAB
topology

Figure 8.2.4-2 shows the procedure for the establishment of the second
path. This procedure has the following steps:

1\. The dual-connecting IAB-MT sends a *MeasurementReport* message to
the first parent node IAB-DU. This report is based on a Measurement
Configuration the dual-connecting IAB-MT received from the IAB-donor-CU
before.

2\. The first parent node IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message to the IAB-donor-CU to convey the received *MeasurementReport*.

3\. The IAB-donor-CU sends the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the
second parent node IAB-DU, to create the UE context for the
dual-connecting IAB-MT and to set up one or more bearers. These bearers
can be used by the dual-connecting IAB-MT for its own signalling, and,
optionally, data traffic.

4\. The second parent node IAB-DU responds to the IAB-donor-CU with a UE
CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.

5\. The IAB-donor-CU sends a DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the
first parent node IAB-DU, which includes a generated
*RRCReconfiguration* message. The *RRCReconfiguration* message may
contain one or more TNL address(es) for the dual-connecting IAB-DU,
which are anchored at the second-path IAB-donor-DU. **The IAB-donor-CU
can proactively obtain these TNL addresses from the second-path
IAB-donor-DU.** In case IPsec tunnel mode is used to protect the F1 and
non-F1 traffic, the allocated TNL address is the outer IP address. **The
TNL address allocation is not necessary if the first and second paths
use the same IAB-donor-DU.**

6\. The first parent node IAB-DU forwards the received
*RRCReconfiguration* message to the dual-connecting IAB-MT.

7\. The dual-connecting IAB-MT responds to the first parent node IAB-DU
with an *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message.

8\. The first parent node IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message to the IAB-donor-CU, to convey the received
*RRCReconfigurationComplete message*.

9\. A Random Access procedure is performed at the second parent node
IAB-DU.

**10. The** IAB-donor-CU **configures BH RLC channels and BAP-layer
route entries on the second path between dual-connecting IAB-node and
second-path IAB-donor-DU. These configurations may be performed at an
earlier stage, e.g. immediately after step 3.**

**11. The new TNL addresses allocated in step 5 (if any) are added to
the dual-connecting IAB-DU's F1-C association(s) with the
IAB-donor-CU.** The IAB-donor-CU may configure new UL BH information on
the second path for F1AP messages.

**If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP
association(s) between the dual-connecting IAB-node and the IAB-donor-CU
may be established using the new TNL address information of the
dual-connecting IAB-node. The dual-connecting IAB-node sends an F1AP
gNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the IAB-donor-CU, which may
include new (outer) IP addresses and corresponding new (inner) IP
address for the F1-U traffic to be switched to the target path.**

**12.** The IAB-donor-CU may migrate the F1-U tunnels it has with the
dual-connecting IAB-DU from the first path to the second path via the UE
CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

13\. The dual-connectivity IAB-DU replies with a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION
RESPONSE message.

**Steps 12 and 13 can be performed for a subset of UE bearers, e.g., to
balance the load between the first and the second path.**

**In case the second path is used for the dual-connecting IAB-node's
descendant node(s), Steps 10 and 11 are also performed for the
descendant node(s), as follows:**

When the second path uses a different IAB-donor-DU, the IAB-donor-CU
shall configure the descendent IAB-DU(s) with one or more new TNL
addresses, which are anchored on the IAB-donor-DU of the second path.

If needed, the IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels, BAP-layer route
entries on the target path for the descendant nodes and the BH RLC
channel mappings on the descendant nodes in the same manner as described
for the dual-connecting IAB-node in step 10.

The descendant nodes' new TNL addresses (if any) are added to the
descendant node IAB-DU's F1-C association(s) with the IAB-donor-CU. The
IAB-donor-CU may configure UL BH information for the second path to
carry F1AP messages.

The IAB-donor-CU may migrate the F1-U tunnels it has with the
dual-connecting IAB-node's descendant node(s) from the first path to the
second path, as described for step 12.

Based on implementation, these steps can be performed after or in
parallel with the redundant path addition of the dual connecting
IAB-node.

**The IAB-donor-CU may initiate the release of the redundant path by
releasing the BAP routing entries and modifying/releasing the BH RLC
channels on that path.**

### 8.2.5 Intra-CU Backhaul RLF recovery for IAB-nodes in SA mode

The intra-CU backhaul RLF recovery procedure for IAB-nodes in SA mode
enables migration of an IAB-node to another parent node underneath the
same IAB-donor-CU, when the IAB-MT declares a backhaul RLF. The
declaration of backhaul RLF is described in TS 38.331 \[23\].

NOTE: Determination of whether the recovery occurs at the same or at a
different IAB-donor-CU is up to implementation.

Figure 8.2.5-1 shows an example of the BH RLF recovery procedure for an
IAB-node in SA mode. In this example, the IAB-node changes from its
initial parent node to a new parent node, where the new parent node is
served by an IAB-donor-DU different than the one serving its initial
parent node.

Figure 8.2.5-1: IAB intra-CU backhaul RLF recovery procedure for an
IAB-node in SA mode

1\. The IAB-MT declares BH RLF for the MCG as described in TS 38.331
\[23\], clause 5.3.10.3.

2\. The IAB-MT undergoing recovery from RLF conducts the RRC
re-establishment procedure at the new parent node, as defined in clause
8.7. In this procedure, the IAB-donor-CU may provide new TNL
address(es), which is(are) anchored at the new IAB-donor-DU, to the
IAB-MT via RRC signalling. Furthermore, the IAB-donor-CU may also
provide a new default UL mapping which includes a default BH RLC channel
and a default BAP Routing ID for UL F1-C/non-F1 traffic on the target
path, to the IAB-node undergoing recovery from RLF via
*RRCReconfiguration* message in this procedure.

3\. The remaining part of the procedure follows the steps 11-15 of the
intra-CU topology adaptation procedure defined in clause 8.2.3.1.

Descendant node(s) of the IAB-node undergoing recovery from RLF may also
need to switch to new TNL address(es) anchored in the target-path
IAB-donor-DU following the same mechanism as described for IAB intra-CU
topology adaptation procedure in clause 8.2.3.1. The descendant node(s)
may also be provided with new default UL mapping via RRC, after the
IAB-node undergoing recovery from RLF connects the IAB-donor-CU via the
recovery path.

8.3 Mechanism of centralized retransmission of lost PDUs
--------------------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Centralized Retransmission in Intra gNB-CU Cases

This mechanism allows to perform the retransmission of the PDCP PDUs
that are not delivered by a gNB-DU (gNB-DU1) because the corresponding
radio links toward the UE are subject to outage. When such outage
occurs, the gNB-DU affected by outage informs the gNB-CU of such event.
The gNB-CU can switch transmission of data traffic, as well as perform
retransmission of undelivered PDCP PDUs, from the gNB-DU affected by
outage to other available gNB-DUs (e.g. gNB-DU2 in Figure 8.3.1-1) with
a well-functioning radio link toward the UE. The mechanism is also
applicable in EN-DC and MR-DC with 5GC, refer to TS 37.340 \[12\].

Figure 8.3.1-1: Procedure for centralized retransmission in intra gNB-CU
scenarios

The mechanism is shown in Figure 8.3.1-1 and targets the
multi-connectivity scenario, where a UE is served by multiple data radio
bearers established at least on two gNB-DUs, and it includes the
following steps:

0\. The UE is connected and can transmit/receive data to/from gNB-DU1
and gNB-DU2.

1\. gNB-DU1 realizes that the radio link towards the UE is experiencing
outage.

2\. gNB-DU1 sends the \"Radio Link Outage\" notification message to the
gNB-CU over the F1-U interface, as part of the DDDS PDU of the concerned
data radio bearer. The message may include information to be used by the
gNB-CU to perform retransmission of the PDCP PDUs that were not
delivered by the gNB-DU1 (e.g. the highest transmitted NR PDCP Sequence
Number, the highest successfully delivered NR PDCP Sequence Number and
the lost NR-U Sequence Numbers).

3\. gNB-CU decides to switch data traffic transmission and
retransmission of PDCP PDUs that were undelivered in gNB-DU1 via
gNB-DU2. gNB-CU stops sending downlink traffic to gNB-DU1. The radio leg
between gNB-DU1 and the UE is not necessarily removed.

4\. gNB-CU starts sending traffic (namely new PDUs and potentially
retransmitted PDUs) to gNB-DU2.

5\. If gNB-DU1 realizes that the radio link of the concerned data radio
bearer is back in normal operation, it may send a \"Radio Link Resume\"
notification message as part of the DDDS PDU over the F1-U interface to
inform the gNB-CU that the radio link can be used again for the
concerned data radio bearer.

6\. gNB-CU may start sending traffic (namely new PDUs and potentially
retransmitted PDUs) of the concerned data radio bearer via gNB-DU1
again.

a Secondary Node Change, the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message may
contain source cell group configuration to allow gNB-DU to perform delta
configuration.

a2. The gNB-DU responds to the gNB-CU with the UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE
message. In case the gNB-DU receives the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
message without the source cell group configuration or in the course of

NOTE: The timing of sending the Step 2 SGNB RELEASE REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message is an example, it may be sent e.g. after step a1 or after a2 and
it is up to implementation.

a1. After receiving SGNB RELEASE REQUEST message from MeNB, gNB-CU sends
the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to gNB-DU to stop the data
transmission for the UE. It is up to gNB-DU implementation when to stop
the UE scheduling.

to stop the data transmission for the UE. It is up to gNB-DU
implementation when to stop the UE scheduling. This step may occur
before step 1.

a2. gNB-DU responds to gNB-CU with UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message.

a3. After receiving the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message from MeNB, the gNB-CU

8.5 F1 Startup and cells activation
-----------------------------------

This function allows to setup the F1 interface between a gNB-DU and a
gNB-CU and it allows to activate the gNB-DU cells.

Figure 8.5-1: F1 startup and cell activation

0\. The gNB-DU and its cells are configured by OAM in the F1
pre-operational state. The gNB-DU has TNL connectivity toward the
gNB-CU.

1\. The gNB-DU sends an F1 SETUP REQUEST message to the gNB-CU including
a list of cells that are configured and ready to be activated. For each
cell supporting NPN the gNB-DU includes NPN specific information.

2\. In NG-RAN, the gNB-CU ensures the connectivity toward the core
network. For this reason, the gNB-CU may initiate either the NG Setup or
the gNB Configuration Update procedure towards 5GC.

3\. The gNB-CU sends an F1 SETUP RESPONSE message to the gNB-DU that
optionally includes a list of cells to be activated. The cells in the
list of cells to be activated in F1 SETUP RESPONSE message become
active, while the cells not in the list are inactive. The cells that are
active are *Out-of-Service* until the gNB-DU indicates that they are
*In-Service* . The gNB-DU will initiate the gNB-DU Configuration Update
procedure towards the gNB-CU and includes the cell(s) that are
*In-Service* and/or the cell(s) that are *Out-Of-Service*. The gNB-DU
may also indicate cell(s) to be deleted, in which case the gNB-CU
removes the corresponding cell(s) information.

4\. The gNB-CU may send a GNB CU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the
gNB-DU that optionally includes a list of cells to be activated, e.g.,
in case that these cells were not activated using the F1 SETUP RESPONSE
message.

5\. The gNB-DU replies with a GNB CU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE
message that optionally includes a list of cells that failed to be
activated. The gNB-CU regards all Active cells as *Out-Of-Service* until
the gNB-DU indicates that they are *In-Service*.

6\. The gNB-CU may initiate either the Xn Setup towards a neighbour
NG-RAN node or the EN-DC X2 Setup procedure towards a neighbour eNB.

NOTE 1: For NG-RAN in case that the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message is not
used to activate any cell, step 2 may be performed after step 3.

Over the F1 interface between a gNB-CU and a gNB-DU pair, the following
two Cell States are possible:

*- Inactive*: the cell is known by both the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU. The
cell shall not serve UEs;

*- Active*: the cell is known by both the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU. The
cell should try to provide services to the UEs.

The gNB-CU decides whether the Cell State should be "Inactive" or
"Active". The gNB-CU can request the gNB-DU to change the Cell State
using the F1 SETUP RESPONSE, theGNB DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE,
or the GNB CU CONFIGURATION UPDATE messages.

The gNB-DU reports to the gNB-CU the *Service Status*. The *Service
Status* is the state of the radio transmission over the air. The
*Service Status* is reported by the gNB-DU for cells for which the Cell
State is "Active ". The following *Service Status* are defined:

*- In-Service*: the cell is operational and able to serve UEs.

*- Out-Of-Service*: the cell is not operational, and it is not able to
serve UEs. The gNB-DU is trying to make the cell operational.

The gNB-DU reports the *Service Status* using the GNB DU CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message.

NOTE 2: If gNB-DU regards that one or more cells cannot become
operational, the gNB-DU deletes them and reports them using the GNB DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.

8.6 RRC state transition
------------------------

### 8.6.1 RRC connected to RRC inactive

This clause gives the RRC connected to RRC inactive state transition
given that gNB consists of gNB-CU and gNB-DU(s), as shown in Figure
8.6.1-1.

Figure 8.6.1-1: RRC connected to RRC inactive state transition procedure

0\. At first, the gNB-CU determines the UE to enter into RRC inactive
mode from connected mode.

1\. The gNB-CU generates *RRCRelease* message which includes suspend
configuration towards UE. The RRC message is encapsulated in UE CONTEXT
RELEASE COMMAND message to the gNB-DU.

2\. The gNB-DU forwards *RRCRelease* message to UE.

3\. The gNB-DU responds with UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message.

### 8.6.2 RRC inactive to other states

This clause gives the RRC inactive to other RRC states transition given
that gNB consists of gNB-CU and gNB-DU(s), as shown in Figure 8.6.2-1.

Figure 8.6.2-1: RRC inactive to other RRC states transition procedure

1\. If data is received from 5GC, the gNB-CU sends PAGING message to the
gNB-DU.

2\. The gNB-DU sends *Paging* message to UE.

NOTE 1: Step 1 and 2 only exist in case of DL data arrival.

3\. The UE sends *RRCResumeRequest* message either upon RAN-based
paging, UL data arrival or RNA update.

4\. The gNB-DU includes *RRCResumeRequest* in a non-UE associated
INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message and transfer to the gNB-CU.

5\. For UE Inactive to UE Active transitions, excluding transitions due
to signalling exchange only, the gNB-CU allocates gNB-CU UE F1AP ID and
sends UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to gNB-DU, which may include SRB
ID(s) and DRB ID(s) to be setup, **CellGroupConfig stored in gNB-CU or
retrieved from the old NG-RAN node may also be included**. In case of
NG-RAN sharing, the gNB-CU includes the serving PLMN ID (in case of
SNPNs the serving NID).

NOTE 1a: In case of CP/UP split architecture, if the UE context has been
retrieved from the old NG-RAN node, the security indication of each PDU
Session as communicated to the gNB-CU-UP represents the user plane
security activation status that the UE used at the last serving cell.

6\. The gNB-DU responds with UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message, which
contains RLC/MAC/PHY configuration of SRB and DRBs provided by the
gNB-DU.

NOTE 2: Step 5 and step 6 exist for inactive to active transitions,
excluding transitions due to signalling exchange only. When gNB-CU
successfully retrieves and verifies the UE context, it may decide to let
the UE enter into RRC active mode. gNB-CU shall trigger UE context setup
procedure between gNB-CU and gNB-DU, during which both SRB1, SRB2 and
DRB(s) can be setup. For signalling exchange only transitions, gNB-CU
does not trigger UE Context Setup procedure. For inactive to Idle
transitions the gNB-CU does not trigger the UE Context Setup procedure.

7\. The gNB-CU generates *RRCResume/RRCSetup*/*RRCReject*/*RRCRelease*
message or receives *RRCRelease* message from the old NG-RAN node
towards the UE. The RRC message is encapsulated in DL RRC MESSAGE
TRANSFER message together with SRB ID.

8\. The gNB-DU forwards RRC message to the UE either over SRB0 or SRB1
as indicated by the SRB ID.

NOTE 3: In step 7, it is expected that gNB-CU takes appropriate action,
e.g. generates RRC resume message for inactive to active state
transition(for both cases of signaling exchange only, and UP data
exchange), generates *RRCSetup* message for fallback to establish a new
RRC connection, and generates or receives from the old NG-RAN node
either *RRCRelease* message without suspend configuration for inactive
to idle state transition, or *RRCRelease* message with suspend
configuration to remain in inactive state.\
If step 5 and 6 are not performed, the gNB-DU deduces the SRB on which
to deliver the RRC message in step 7 from the SRB ID, i.e. SRB ID "0"
corresponds to SRB0, SRB ID "1" corresponds to SRB1.

9\. The UE sends *RRCResumeComplete*/*RRCSetupComplete* message to the
gNB-DU.

10\. The gNB-DU encapsulates RRC in UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message and
send to the gNB-CU.

NOTE 4: Step 9 and step 10 exist for inactive to active state transition
(for both cases of signaling exchange only, and UP data exchange). UE
generates *RRCResumeComplete*/*RRCSetupComplete* message for resume the
existing RRC connection or fallback to a new RRC connection
respectively.

8.7 RRC connection reestablishment
----------------------------------

This procedure is used for the case that UE tries to reestablish the RRC
connection, as shown in Figure 8.7-1.

Figure 8.7-1: RRC connection reestablishment procedure

1\. The UE sends a preamble to the gNB-DU.

2\. The gNB-DU allocates new C-RNTI and responds with RAR.

3\. The UE sends an *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message to the gNB-DU,
which contains old C-RNTI and old PCI.

4\. The gNB-DU includes the RRC message and, if the UE is admitted, the
corresponding low layer configuration for the UE in the INITIAL UL RRC
MESSAGE TRANSFER message and transfers to the gNB-CU. The INITIAL UL RRC
MESSAGE TRANSFER message includes the new C-RNTI. If the gNB-DU
identifies the UE as a Reduced Capability UE during the random access
procedure, a NR RedCap UE Indication or a NR eRedCap UE Indication is
provided in the INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message.

5\. The gNB-CU includes an *RRCReestablishment* message and transfers to
the gNB-DU. If the UE requests to re-establish RRC connection in the
last serving gNB-DU, the DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message shall include
old gNB-DU UE F1AP ID.

6\. The gNB-DU retrieves the UE context based on the old gNB-DU UE F1AP
ID, and replaces old C-RNTI/PCI with new C-RNTI/PCI. It sends the
*RRCReestablishment* message to UE.

7-8. The UE sends an *RRCReestablishmentComplete* message to the gNB-DU.
The gNB-DU encapsulates the RRC message in the UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message and sends to the gNB-CU.

9-10. The gNB-CU triggers an UE Context Modification procedure by
sending UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message, which may include DRBs
to be modified and released list. The gNB-DU responses with the UE
CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.

9\'-10\'. The gNB-DU triggers an UE Context Modification procedure by
sending UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUIRED message, which may include DRBs
to be modified and released list. The gNB-CU responses with UE CONTEXT
MODIFICATION CONFIRM message.

NOTE 1: Here it is assumed that the UE accessed the original gNB-DU
where the UE context is available for that UE, and either steps 9-10 or
steps 9'-10' may be executed or both could be skipped.

NOTE 2: If the UE accessed from a gNB-DU other than the original one,
the gNB-CU should trigger the UE Context Setup procedure toward this new
gNB-DU.

11-12. The gNB-CU includes an *RRCReconfiguration* message into the DL
RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message and transfers to the gNB-DU. The gNB-DU
forwards it to the UE.

13-14. The UE sends an *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message to the
gNB-DU, and the gNB-DU forwards it to the gNB-CU.

8.8 Multiple TNLAs for F1-C
---------------------------

In the following, the procedure for managing multiple TNLAs for F1-C is
described.

Figure 8.8-1: Managing multiple TNLAs for F1-C.

1\. The gNB-DU establishes the first TNLA with the gNB-CU using a
configured TNL address.

NOTE: The gNB-DU may use different source and/or destination IP end
point(s) if the TNL establishment towards one IP end point fails. How
the gNB-DU gets the remote IP end point(s) and its own IP address are
outside the scope of this specification.

2-3. Once the TNLA has been established, the gNB-DU initiates the F1
Setup procedure to exchange application level configuration data.

4-6. The gNB-CU may add additional TNL Endpoint(s) to be used for F1-C
signalling between the gNB-CU and the gNB-DU pair using the gNB-CU
Configuration Update procedure. The gNB-CU Configuration Update
procedure also allows the gNB-CU to request the gNB-DU to modify or
release TNLA(s).

7-9. The gNB-DU may add additional TNL association(s) to be used for
F1-C signalling *using a gNB-CU endpoint already in use for existing TNL
associations* between the gNB-CU and the gNB-DU pair. The gNB-DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message including the gNB-DU ID shall be the first
F1AP message sent on an additional TNLA of an already setup F1-C
interface instance after the TNL association has become operational.

The F1AP UE TNLA binding is a binding between a F1AP UE association and
a specific TNL association for a given UE. After the F1AP UE TNLA
binding is created, the gNB-CU can update the UE TNLA binding by sending
the F1AP message for the UE to the gNB-DU via a different TNLA. The
gNB-DU shall update the F1AP UE TNLA binding with the new TNLA. The
gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure also allows the gNB-DU to inform
the gNB-CU that the indicated TNLA(s) will be removed by the gNB-DU.

8.9 Overall procedures involving E1 and F1
------------------------------------------

The following clauses describe the overall procedures involving E1 and
F1.

NOTE: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
also apply to ng-eNB and W1/E1 interface, i.e. W1 interface between
ng-eNB-DU and ng-eNB-CU-CP/ng-eNB-CU-UP, E1 interface between
ng-eNB-CU-CP and ng-eNB-CU-UP, if not explicitly specified otherwise.

### 8.9.1 UE Initial Access

The signalling flow for UE Initial access involving E1 and F1 is shown
in Figure 8.9.1-1.

Figure 8.9.1-1: UE Initial Access procedure involving E1 and F1

Steps 1-8 are defined in clause 8.1.

9\. The gNB-CU-CP sends the BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to
establish the bearer context in the gNB-CU-UP.

10 The gNB-CU-UP sends the BEARER CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message to the
gNB-CU-CP, including F1-U UL TEID and transport layer address allocated
by the gNB-CU-UP.

Steps 11-13 are defined in clause 8.1.

14\. The gNB-CU-CP sends the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message
to the gNB-CU-UP, including F1-U DL TEID and transport layer address
allocated by the gNB-DU.

15\. The gNB-CU-UP sends the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message to the gNB-CU-CP.

Steps 16-22 are defined in clause 8.1.

NOTE: Steps 14-15 and steps 16-17 can happen in parallel, but both are
before step 18.

### 8.9.2 Bearer context setup over F1-U

Figure 8.9.2-1 shows the procedure used to setup the bearer context in
the gNB-CU-UP.

Figure 8.9.2-1: Bearer context setup over F1-U

0\. Bearer context setup (e.g., following an SGNB ADDITION REQUEST
message from the MeNB) is triggered in gNB-CU-CP.

1\. The gNB-CU-CP sends a BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message
containing UL TNL address information for S1-U or NG-U, and if required,
DL TNL address information for X2-U to setup the bearer context in the
gNB-CU-UP. For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU-CP decides flow-to-DRB mapping and
sends the generated SDAP and PDCP configuration to the gNB-CU-UP.

NOTE 1: In case of Conditional Handover or Conditional PSCell
Addition/Change, the BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message indicates to
ignore the included security context and not to initiate sending
downlink packets until the UE successfully accesses. Up to
implementation, the gNB-CU-CP may request to establish bearer context as
if a regular HO was requested.

2\. The gNB-CU-UP responds with a BEARER CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message
containing the UL TNL address information for F1-U, and DL TNL address
information for S1-U or NG-U, and if required, UL TNL address
information for X2-U or Xn-U.

NOTE 2: The indirect data transmission for split bearer through the
gNB-CU-UP is not precluded.

3\. F1 UE context setup procedure is performed to setup one or more
bearers in the gNB-DU.

4\. The gNB-CU-CP sends a BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message
containing the DL TNL address information for F1-U or Xn-U, and PDCP
status.

NOTE 3: In case the indirect path indication is received in step 4, the
gNB-CU-UP may not discard the DL data based on the Downlink Data
Delivery Status frame received from the gNB-DU. During the inter-gNB
indirect-to-direct or indirect-to-indirect path switching, the source
gNB-CU-UP forwards the buffered DL data to the target gNB as specified
in TS 38.300 \[2\]. In case of the PDCP duplication, the gNB-CU-UP
should not request the discard of the duplicated DL data to the gNB-DU
for the direct path based on the Downlink Data Delivery Status frame
received from the gNB-DU for the indirect path, and only act as
specified in TS 38.323 \[36\].

5\. The gNB-CU-UP responds with a BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message.

### 8.9.3 Bearer context release over F1-U

#### 8.9.3.1 gNB-CU-CP initiated bearer context release

Figure 8.9.3.1-1 shows the procedure used to release the bearer context
in the gNB-CU-UP initiated by the gNB-CU-CP.

Figure 8.9.3.1-1: Bearer context release over F1-U -- gNB-CU-CP
initiated

0\. Bearer context release (e.g., following an SGNB RELEASE REQUEST
message from the MeNB) is triggered in gNB-CU-CP.

1\. The gNB-CU-CP sends a BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to
the gNB-CU-UP.

2\. The gNB-CU-UP responds with a BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
carrying the PDCP UL/DL status.

3\. F1 UE context modification procedure is performed to stop the data
transmission for the UE. It is up to gNB-DU implementation when to stop
the UE scheduling.

NOTE: step 1-3 are performed only if the PDCP status of the bearer(s)
needs to be preserved e.g., for bearer type change.

4\. The gNB-CU-CP may receive the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message from the
MeNB in EN-DC operation as described in clause 8.4.2.1.

5\. and 7. Bearer context release procedure is performed.

6\. F1 UE context release procedure is performed to release the UE
context in the gNB-DU.

#### 8.9.3.2 gNB-CU-UP initiated bearer context release

Figure 8.9.3.2-1 shows the procedure used to release the bearer context
in the gNB-CU-UP initiated by the gNB-CU-UP.

Figure 8.9.3.2-1: Bearer context release over F1-U -- gNB-CU-UP
initiated

0\. Bearer context release is triggered in gNB-CU-UP e.g., due to local
failure.

1\. The gNB-CU-UP sends a BEARER CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message to
request the release of the bearer context in the gNB-CU-UP. This message
may contain the PDCP status.

2.- 5. If the PDCP status needs to be preserved, the E1 Bearer Context
Modification and the F1 UE Context Modification procedures are
performed. The E1 Bearer Context Modification procedure is used to
convey data forwarding information to the gNB-CU-UP. The gNB-CU-CP may
receive the UE Context Release from the MeNB.

6\. The gNB-CU-CP sends a BEARER CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to
release the bearer context in the gNB-CU-UP.

7\. The gNB-CU-UP responds with a BEARER CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE to
confirm the release of the bearer context including also data forwarding
information.

8\. F1 UE context release procedure may be performed to release the UE
context in the gNB-DU.

### 8.9.4 Inter-gNB handover involving gNB-CU-UP change

Figure 8.9.4-1 shows the procedure used for inter-gNB handover involving
gNB-CU-UP change. Overall inter-gNB handover procedure is specified in
TS 37.340 \[12\].

Figure 8.9.4-1: Inter-gNB handover involving gNB-CU-UP change

1\. The source gNB-CU-CP sends HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target
gNB-CU-CP. In case of Conditional Handover, the target gNB is regarded
as a candidate gNB which is only accessed by the UE when the CHO
condition(s) are fulfilled.

2-4. Bearer Context Setup procedure is performed as described in clause
8.9.2.

5\. The target gNB-CU-CP responds the source gNB-CU-CP with an HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.

NOTE 1: In case of Conditional Handover, it is up to target gNB-CU-CP
implementation to make sure that the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER information
is forwarded to the right gNB-CU-UP (e.g. separate UE-associated
signalling connection over Xn interface for each gNB-CU-UP).

6\. The F1 UE Context Modification procedure is performed to send the
handover command to the UE, and to indicate to stop the data
transmission for the UE.

NOTE 2: In case of DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover, the F1 UE
Context Modification procedure in step 6 does not indicate to stop the
data transmission for the UE. Instead, the F1 DL RRC Message Transfer
procedure can be used which carries the handover command to the UE.

7-8. Bearer Context Modification procedure (gNB-CU-CP initiated) is
performed to enable the gNB-CU-CP to retrieve the PDCP UL/DL status and
to exchange data forwarding information for the bearer.

9\. The source gNB-CU-CP sends an SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the
target gNB-CU-CP.

NOTE 3: In case of DAPS Handover, the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message is
sent for DRBs configured with DAPS instead of the SN STATUS TRANSFER
message.

NOTE 4: In case of Conditional Handover, the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER
message is sent only if early data forwarding is applied.

NOTE 5: The COUNT related info for the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message is
retrieved from the source gNB-CU-UP via the steps 7/8.

10-11. Bearer Context Modification procedure is performed as described
in clause 8.9.2. The target gNB-CU-CP does not transfer the PDCP UL/DL
status carried from the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target
gNB-CU-UP if the PDCP status does not need to be preserved (e.g. full
configuration). In case of DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover, the
COUNT related info carried by the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message is
provided to the target gNB-CU-UP.

12\. Data Forwarding may be performed from the source gNB-CU-UP to the
target gNB-CU-UP.

NOTE 6: In case of Conditional Handover, the UE performs RACH when the
CHO condition(s) are fulfilled. Once successfully accessed, the target
gNB-DU sends an ACCESS SUCCESS message to inform the target gNB-CU-CP of
which cell the UE has accessed through. The target gNB-CU-CP may forward
to the target gNB-CU-UP, necessary information for sending downlink
packets (i.e. DL TNL address information for F1-U and UP security
information corresponding to the accessed cell), via a Bearer context
modification procedure. The target gNB-CU-CP may initiate Bearer context
release procedure toward the other signalling connections or other
candidate target gNB-CU-UPs, if any, to release the prepared conditional
handover resources for the UE.

12a. In case of DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover, the target
gNB-CU-CP sends the HANDOVER SUCCESS message to the source gNB-CU-CP to
inform that the UE has successfully accessed the target cell.

12b In case of DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover, the F1 UE Context
Modification procedure is performed to indicate to stop the data
transmission for the UE.

12c-12d. In case of DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover, the Bearer
context modification procedure (gNB-CU-CP initiated) is performed to
indicate the source gNB-CU-UP to stop packet delivery and also to
retrieve the PDCP UL/DL status.

12e. In case of DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover, the source
gNB-CU-CP sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target gNB-CU-CP.

12f-12g. In case of DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover, the Bearer
context modification procedure is performed to provide the PDCP UL/DL
status to the target gNB-CU-UP only if the PDCP status needs to be
preserved as described in TS 38.300 \[2\].

NOTE 7: In case of Conditional Handover, inactivity monitoring is
performed after step 12g.

13-15. Path Switch procedure is performed to update the DL TNL address
information for the NG-U towards the core network.

16\. The target gNB-CU-CP sends an UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to the
source gNB-CU-CP.

17\. and 19. Bearer Context Release procedure is performed.

18\. F1 UE Context Release procedure is performed to release the UE
context in the source gNB-DU.

### 8.9.5 Change of gNB-CU-UP

Figure 8.9.5-1 shows the procedure used for the change of gNB-CU-UP
within a gNB.

Figure 8.9.5-1: Change of gNB-CU-UP

1\. Change of gNB-CU-UP is triggered in gNB-CU-CP based on e.g.,
measurement report from the UE.

2-3. Bearer Context Setup procedure is performed as described in clause
8.9.2.

4\. F1 UE Context Modification procedure is performed to change the UL
TNL address information for F1-U for one or more bearers in the gNB-DU.

5-6. Bearer Context Modification procedure (gNB-CU-CP initiated) is
performed to enable the gNB-CU-CP to retrieve the PDCP UL/DL status and
to exchange data forwarding information for the bearer.

7-8. Bearer Context Modification procedure is performed as described in
clause 8.9.2.

9\. Data Forwarding may be performed from the source gNB-CU-UP to the
target gNB-CU-UP.

10-12. PDU Session Resource Modify Indication procedure is performed to
update the DL TNL address information for the NG-U towards the core
network.

13-14. Bearer Context Release procedure (gNB-CU-CP initiated) is
performed as described in clause 8.9.3.

### 8.9.6 RRC State transition

#### 8.9.6.1 RRC Connected to RRC Inactive

session/DRB level inactivity timer.

2\. The gNB-CU-UP sends BEARER CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.

3\. The gNB-CU-UP sends BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message
with inactivity monitoring results.

4\. The gNB-CU-CP determines that the UE should enter RRC-inactive
(e.g., after receiving Bearer Context Inactivity Notification
procedure).

5\. The gNB-CU-CP sends BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
a Bearer Context Status Change to the gNB-CU-UP, which indicates that
the UE is entering RRC-inactive state. The gNB-CU-CP keeps the F1 UL
TEIDs.

6\. The gNB-CU-UP sends the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message
including the PDCP UL and DL status that may be needed for e.g., data
volume reporting. The gNB-CU-UP keeps the Bearer Context, the
UE-associated logical E1-connection, the NG-U related resource (e.g.,
NG-U DL TEIDs) and the F1 UL TEIDs.

7\. The gNB-CU-CP sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the
gNB-DU serving the UE, together with the *RRCRelease* message to be sent
to the UE.

NOTE: step 5 and step 7 can be performed at the same time.

8\. The gNB-DU sends the *RRCRelease* message to the UE.

9\. The gNB-DU sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message to the
gNB-CU-CP.

#### 8.9.6.2 RRC Inactive to other states

The procedure for changing the UE state from RRC-inactive to
RRC-connected is shown in Figure 8.9.6.2-1.

Figure 8.9.6.2-1: RRC Inactive to RRC Connected state transition.

0\. The gNB-CU-UP receives DL data on NG-U interface.

1\. The gNB-CU-UP sends DL DATA NOTIFICATION message to the gNB-CU-CP.

2\. The gNB-CU-CP sends PAGING message to the gNB-DU.

3\. The gNB-DU sends the *Paging* message to the UE.

NOTE 1: steps 0-3 are needed only in case of DL data.

4\. The UE sends *RRCResumeRequest* message either upon RAN paging or UL
data arrival.

5\. The gNB-DU sends the INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the
gNB-CU-CP.

6\. The gNB-CU-CP sends UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message including the
stored F1 UL TEIDs to create the UE context in the gNB-DU.

7\. The gNB-DU responds with the UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message
including the F1 DL TEIDs allocated for the DRBs.

8\. The gNB-CU-CP and the UE perform the RRC-Resume procedure via the
gNB-DU.

9\. The gNB-CU-CP sends BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
a RRC Resume indication, which indicates that the UE is resuming from
RRC-inactive state. The gNB-CU-CP also includes the F1 DL TEIDs received
from the gNB-DU in step 7.

10\. The gNB-CU-UP responds with theBEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message.

NOTE 2: steps 8 and 9 can be performed in parallel.

### 8.9.7 Trace activation/deactivation over F1 and E1

Figure 8.9.6-1 shows the procedure used for the activation and the
deactivation of UE traces in the gNB-DU, the gNB-CU-UP or both.

Figure 8.9.6-1: Trace activation/deactivation over F1 and E1

1\. The gNB-CU-CP receives a TRACE START message from the AMF or the
MeNB (in case of EN-DC).

2\. The gNB-CU-CP initiates the Trace Start procedure by sending a TRACE
START message to the gNB-DU, the gNB-CU-UP or both.

3\. Upon reception of the TRACE START message, the gNB-DU, the gNB-CU-UP
or both initiate the requested trace session and report it as described
in TS 32.422 \[20\].

4\. The gNB-CU-CP receives a DEACTIVATE TRACE message from the AMF or
the MeNB (in case of EN-DC).

5\. The gNB-CU-CP initiates the Deactivate Trace procedure by sending a
DEACTIVATE TRACE message to the gNB-DU, the gNB-CU-UP or both.

6\. Upon reception of the DEACTIVATE TRACE message, the gNB-DU, the
gNB-CU-UP or both stop the trace session for the indicated trace
reference.

### 8.9.8 BH RLC channel establishment procedure

NOTE: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
does not apply to ng-eNB

The BH RLC channel is an RLC channel used for backhauling between
IAB-node and IAB-donor-DU, or between different IAB-nodes. The BH RLC
channel establishment may be triggered by a UE accessing the network and
establishing a DRB.

Figure 8.9.8-1: Signalling flow for IAB BH RLC channel establishment
procedure

1\. The IAB-donor-CU sends to the IAB-donor-DU a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION
REQUEST message for setting up the parent-node IAB-DU side of the BH
link between IAB-donor-DU and IAB-node 1. This step is optional and is

BH link between IAB-donor-DU and IAB-node 1.

5\. The IAB-MT of IAB-node 1 sends to the IAB-donor-DU an
*RRCReconfigurationComplete* message destined to the IAB-donor-CU. This
step is optional and is required only when a new BH RLC channel needs to
be established on the BH link between IAB-donor-DU and IAB-node 1.

6\. The IAB-donor-DU sends the UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message
encapsulating the *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message to the
IAB-donor-CU. This step is optional and is required only when a new BH
RLC channel needs to be established on the BH link between IAB-donor-DU
and IAB-node 1.

required only when a new BH RLC channel needs to be established on the
BH link between IAB-node 1 and IAB-node 2.

10\. The IAB-DU of IAB-node 1 decapsulates and forwards the
*RRCReconfiguration* message to the IAB-MT of IAB-node 2. This step is
optional and is required only when a new BH RLC channel needs to be
established on the BH link between IAB-node 1 and IAB-node 2.

11\. The IAB-MT of IAB-node 2 sends to IAB-node 1 an
*RRCReconfigurationComplete* message destined to the IAB-donor-CU. This
step is optional and is required only when a new BH RLC channel needs to
be established on the BH link between IAB-node 1 and IAB-node 2.

12\. IAB-node 1 sends the UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message encapsulating
the *RRCReconfigurationComplete* message to the IAB-donor-CU. This step
is optional and is required only when a new BH RLC channel needs to be
established on the BH link between IAB-node 1 and IAB-node 2.

The IAB-donor-CU uses the existing CU-DU split principles and the UE
Context Setup procedure or UE Context Modification procedure to
configure the parent IAB-DU side of the BH RLC channel. The IAB-donor-CU
uses RRC signaling (which is encapsulated in the DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message terminating at the parent node IAB-DU side of the BH RLC
channel) to configure the child node IAB-MT side of the BH RLC channel.

The IAB-donor-CU configures the IAB-DU with a mapping to the BH RLC
channel to be used for a specific UL F1-U tunnel during the UE Context
Setup procedure or the F1-AP UE Context Modification procedure for the
UE.

### 8.9.9 Traffic Mapping

NOTE: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
does not apply to ng-eNB.

#### **8.9.9.1** Traffic **Mapping from IP-layer to Layer-2**

When forwarding IP packets, the IAB-donor-DU performs the traffic
mapping from IP-layer to layer-2 as defined in TS 38.340 \[22\]. The
traffic mapping information is configured by the IAB-donor-CU, which
contains the IP header information, and the BH information including the
BAP routing ID and a list of egress link and BH RLC channel pairs.

Multiple traffic mappings can contain the same BAP routing ID and/or
list of egress link and BH RLC channel pairs.

The traffic mappings can be configured as part of the UE Context Setup
or UE Context Modification procedures. They may also be configured via
the non-UE-associated BAP Mapping Configuration procedure.

NOTE 1: Implementation must ensure the avoidance of potential race
conditions, i.e. no conflicting configurations are concurrently
performed using UE-associated and non-UE-associated procedures.

The traffic mapping from IP-layer to layer-2 may include IPv6 Flow Label
information. For DL F1 or X2 traffic, the IPv6 Flow Label information is
set by the IAB-donor-CU or MeNB, respectively. When this traffic is
protected via IPsec tunnel mode, the IPv6 Flow Label is set on the inner
header by the IAB-donor-CU or MeNB, and the security gateway shall copy
the IPv6 Flow Label from the inner IP header to the outer IP header to
ensure that the IAB-donor-DU can perform the traffic mapping considering
the IPv6 Flow Label.

NOTE 2: Implementation must ensure that IPv6 Flow Label collisions are
avoided on the IP backhaul network between security gateway and
IAB-donor-DU.

#### **8.9.9.2 BH RLC Channel Mapping on BAP Layer**

When traffic is forwarded on BAP layer as described in TS 38.300 \[2\],
the IAB-node performs the BH RLC channel mapping as defined in TS 38.340
\[22\]. The BH RLC channel mapping information is configured by the
IAB-donor-CU.

The BH RLC channel mappings can be configured as part of the UE Context
Setup or UE Context Modification procedures. They may also be configured
via the non-UE-associated BAP Configuration procedure.

NOTE: Implementation must ensure the avoidance of potential race
conditions, i.e. that no conflicting configurations are concurrently
performed using UE-associated and non-UE-associated procedures.

### 8.9.10 IAB-node release

NOTE: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
does not apply to ng-eNB.

An IAB-node may depart the network either in an orderly fashion, which
implies that both the network and the IAB-node are aware in advance, or
in a disorderly fashion (e.g. due to an RLF with failed recovery).

#### 8.9.10.1 IAB-node orderly release

For orderly release, the IAB-donor-CU can remove the F1 interface
connection to the IAB-DU without releasing the IAB-MT. If the IAB-MT
needs to be released, IAB-MT will perform the deregistration procedure.
If both F1 interface and IAB-MT need to be released, the IAB-donor-CU
should remove the F1 interface to the IAB-DU before it releases the
collocated IAB-MT. The deregistration procedure is the same as the UE
deregistration procedure. The IAB-donor-CU hands over the UEs or child
IAB-nodes currently connected to the IAB-node's cell(s) to another
cell(s), or releases the UEs and may stop accepting incoming handovers
or connections to the IAB-node that is about to be released. The
IAB-donor-CU may also update/release the BH RLC channels in the
intermediate hops. At this point, the F1 interface will be released and
the corresponding SCTP associations will be removed.

#### 8.9.10.2 IAB-node disorderly release

For the disorderly release case, how to remove the IAB-node context is
up to network implementation.

### 8.9.11 IAB-node OAM

NOTE 0: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
does not apply to ng-eNB.

The IAB-node receives commands, configuration data and software
downloads (e.g. for equipment software upgrades) from its OAM system.
The IAB-node can also send alarms and traffic counter information to its
OAM system. The transport connection between the IAB-node and its OAM,
using IP, is provided by the IAB-MT's PDU session via 5G network, or the
IAB-MT's PDN connection via LTE network when IAB-MT uses EN-DC.

NOTE 1: The transport connection between the IAB-node and its OAM may
also be provided using the Backhaul IP layer by implementation.

Alarms in the IAB generate bursts of high-priority traffic, to be
transported in real time. Traffic counters generate bursts of traffic,
but their transport need not be real-time. Configuration messages from
OAM to the IAB will also generate small bursts of traffic, possibly with
lower priority than alarms but still delay-sensitive: when a
configuration is committed on the OAM, the time interval between the
commitment and the effect on the equipment shall be small. Alarm
messages and commands should be transported on a high-priority bearer,
while counters may be transported on a lower priority bearer.

OAM software download to the IAB may generate larger amounts of data,
but both the required data rate and the priority of this kind of traffic
are much lower than in the case of alarms, commands and counters.

For different types of OAM traffic, it is necessary to use different
DRBs between the IAB-MT and the serving DU, and different BH RLC
channels for intermediate hops, with different QoS parameters.
Aggregation of F1-U traffic for OAM with other F1-U traffic on the same
BH RLC channels is not precluded. The QoS parameters are provided to the
IAB-donor during the IAB-MT's PDU session establishment, or the IAB-MT's
PDN connection establishment when IAB-MT uses EN-DC.

NOTE 2: When the transport connection between the IAB-node and its OAM
is provided by the Backhaul IP layer, the OAM traffic may be aggregated
with other traffic types on the same BH RLC channel. The QoS for OAM is
ensured by implementation.

The continuity of OAM connectivity needs to be ensured as the mobile
IAB-node moves across the mobile network.

### 8.9.12 Handling of IAB-MTs in INACTIVE State

NOTE: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
does not apply to ng-eNB.

The IAB-MT optionally supports the RRC INACTIVE state. Upon the IAB-MT
entering the RRC INACTIVE state, it is up to implementation to keep or
release the F1 connection of the collocated IAB-DU.

### 8.9.13 IP Address Allocation for IAB-nodes

NOTE 0: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
does not apply to ng-eNB.

An IAB-node may obtain IP address(es) either from the IAB-donor or from
the OAM system. The IP address(es) is(are) used by the IAB-node for F1
and non-F1 traffic exchange via the backhaul. In case IPsec tunnel mode
is used to protect this F1 and non-F1 traffic, the IP address(es) refer
to the outer tunnel addresses. The allocation of the inner tunnel IP
address(es) is outside of 3GPP scope.

NOTE 1: The non-F1 traffic of an IAB-node includes all IP traffic that
is not used for the management or transport of F1-C as specified in TS
38.472 \[26\] or F1-U as specified in TS 38.474 \[7\]. The non-F1
traffic may include, e.g., OAM traffic if it is transferred using the BH
RLC channel.

In case of IAB-donor-based IP address allocation, the IP address(es)
is(are) allocated by the IAB-donor-CU or IAB-donor-DU. In both cases,
the IAB-node requests the IP address(es) via RRC from the IAB-donor-CU.
It includes a separate IP address request for each usage, where the
usages defined are all traffic, F1-U, F1-C and non-F1. The IAB-donor-CU
may initiate the IAB TNL Address Allocation procedure to obtain IP
addresses from the IAB-donor-DU. The IAB-donor-CU sends the IP addresses
allocated for each usage to the IAB-node via RRC. In case of IAB
inter-CU topology management, the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may obtain
the IP addresses for each usage in the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU's
topology from the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU for the boundary
IAB-node and the descendant IAB-nodes of the boundary IAB-node.

The IAB-node may be allocated one or multiple IPv6 addresses or one
64-bit IPv6 prefix for each usage and/or one or multiple IPv4 addresses
for each usage. Each allocated IP address/IPv6 prefix is unique within
the IAB network and routable from the wireline network.

In case of OAM-based IP address allocation, the IAB-node informs the
IAB-donor-CU via an UL RRC message about the IP address(es) it received
for each purpose. The mapping between the IP addresses assigned to the
IAB-node and the BAP address(es) of the corresponding IAB-donor-DU(s)
anchoring these IP addresses should be known by the IAB-node and the
IAB-donor-CU based on implementation. This occurs before the IAB node
uses the IP address(es) for UL and/or DL traffic.

The IAB-donor-CU configures the IAB-donor-DU with mappings between IP
header fields and L2 parameters (BAP Routing ID, BH RLC channels) used
for DL traffic. Each mapping configuration may hold an IPv4 address,
IPv6 address or a 64-bit IPv6 prefix. In case of two mapping entries
matching the same IP header where one holds an IPv6 prefix and the other
holds a full IPv6 address, the one with full IPv6 address takes
precedence at the IAB-donor-DU.

In case of IAB-donor-allocated IP addresses, the IAB-node's IP
address(es) can be updated using DL RRC signalling.

For **F1-C traffic transfer** for NSA IAB, the LTE leg and NR leg should
use separate IP address pairs {IAB-DU's IP address, IAB-donor-CU's IP
address}. How the IAB-DU gets the remote IP end point(s) and its own IP
address for LTE leg is not specified in this release.

### 8.9.14 Mobile IAB-node authorization

During the mobile IAB-node integration procedure or mobile IAB-MT
migration via NG handover, the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU receives the
authorization status of the mobile IAB-node from the 5GC. During the
mobile IAB-MT migration via Xn handover procedure and the mobile
IAB-node RLF recovery procedure, the target/new RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU receives the authorization status of the mobile IAB-node
from the source/initial RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU as well as from the
5GC during Path Switch Request procedure. If the authorization status is
"not authorized", the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU does not establish
any backhaul resources. Additionally, the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU
does not allocate any BAP address, TNL address(es) or default BAP
configuration for this mobile IAB-node. If the authorization status for
the mobile IAB-node changes, the 5GC sends an updated authorization
status to the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

In case the mobile IAB-MT and its co-located mobile IAB-DU connect to
same IAB-donor-CU, and the updated authorization status received from
the 5GC is "not authorized", the IAB-donor-CU performs the following
actions in the following order: it attempts to hand over the UEs served
by the mobile IAB-node to other cell(s), releases the F1 interface
towards the mobile IAB-DU, and then releases all backhaul resources, the
BAP address, TNL address and default BAP configuration for this mobile
IAB-node.

In case the mobile IAB-MT and its co-located mobile IAB-DU connect to
different IAB-donor-CUs, the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU sends the
updated authorization status to the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU via the
IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION REQUEST message. The F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU confirms the reception of the updated authorization status
via the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.

NOTE1: In absence of Xn connectivity between the RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU and the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, the passing of the
authorization status is left up to implementation.

NOTE2: The implementation should ensure that the IAB Transport Migration
Management procedure is initiated once the F1 setup of the mobile IAB-DU
or the mobile IAB-MT migration has completed, so that the
RRC-terminating IAB-donor can send the updated authorization status via
the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

If the updated authorization status for the mobile IAB-node is set to
"not authorized", the F1-terminating IAB-donor attempts to hand over the
UEs served by the mobile IAB-node to other cell(s), and then releases
the F1 interface towards the mobile IAB-DU. After that, the
F1-terminating IAB-donor requests from the RRC-terminating IAB-donor the
release of all the offloaded traffic via the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION
MANAGEMENT REQUEST message. The RRC-terminating IAB-donor releases the
offloaded traffic and all backhaul resources, BAP address, TNL address
and default BAP configuration for this mobile IAB-node. The
RRC-terminating IAB-donor may send an indication that the mobile IAB-MT
can be deregistered via a UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message, to the
AMF.

If the authorization status is changed back from "not authorized" to
"authorized", the phase 2 and phase 3 of the mobile IAB-node integration
procedure as defined in clause 8.12.3 are carried out.

### 8.9.15 IAB-donor-CU-based NR Cell Identity (NCI) (re-)configuration for mobile IAB cells

The NCIs of the cells served by a mobile IAB-DU configured by the OAM
can be reconfigured by the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU serving the
mobile IAB-DU, in case of an NCI collision with cells of other gNB-DUs
served by the IAB-donor-CU. The reconfiguration of NCI pertains to the
reconfiguration of the cellLocalId part of the NCI, where the new
cellLocalId(s) are based on a list of NCIs that has been configured at
the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

The value change of cellLocalId(s) shall be indicated to the OAM system
of the mobile IAB-DU following the NCI reconfiguration. The mobile
IAB-DU can notify OAM about the reconfigured cellLocalId(s) using
notifications specified in TS 28.532 \[33\].

NOTE: This shall not affect the existing procedure of configuring NCGI
of cells served by a stationary gNB-DU via the OAM.

### 8.9.16 TAC/RANAC (re-)configuration for mobile IAB

The TAC/RANAC of mobile IAB-DU's cell is configured by the OAM, and it
can be reconfigured by the OAM during the mobile IAB-node mobility. The
TAC/RANAC of the mobile IAB-DU's cell may be same as or different than
the TAC/RANAC of the co-located mobile IAB-MT's serving cell. The
TAC/RANAC broadcasted by the mobile IAB-DU cell can be changed in order
to reflect the mobile IAB-node's physical location.

### 8.9.17 IAB-node authorization

#### 8.9.17.1 IAB-node in NSA

During the IAB-node integration procedure, the eNB receives the
authorization status of the IAB-node from the EPC. The eNB forwards the
authorization status to the IAB-donor in the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST
message. If the authorization status is "not authorized", the IAB-donor
neither establishes the backhaul resources nor allocates any BAP
address, TNL address or default BAP configuration for this IAB-node.

When the authorization status for the IAB-node changes, the EPC sends an
updated authorization status to the IAB-MT's eNB. The eNB forwards the
authorization status to the IAB-donor in the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST
message or SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

In case the updated authorization status is "not authorized", the
IAB-donor performs the following actions in this order: it attempts to
hand over the UEs and descendant nodes served by the IAB-node to other
cell(s), releases the F1 interface towards the IAB-DU, and releases all
backhaul resources (including the BAP address, TNL address and default
BAP configuration) for this IAB-node. The IAB-donor may indicate to the
eNB that the actions described above have been completed, by sending a
SGNB MODIFICATION REQUIRED or SGNB RELEASE REQUIRED message with the
corresponding cause value included. Then, the eNB may indicate to the
EPC that the IAB-MT can be de-registered.

#### 8.9.17.2 IAB-node with single IAB-donor in SA

##### 8.9.17.2.1 IAB-node is single-connected

During the IAB-node network integration or RLF recovery, the IAB-donor
receives the authorization status of the IAB-node from the 5GC. Also,
during the inter-CU topology adaptation procedure, the target IAB-donor
receives the authorization status of the IAB-node from the source
IAB-donor as well as from the 5GC when performing the Path Switch
Request procedure. If the authorization status is received for the first
time by the IAB-donor and if the status is "not authorized", the
IAB-donor neither establishes the backhaul resources nor allocates any
BAP address, TNL address or default BAP configuration for this IAB-node.
When the authorization status for the IAB-node changes, the 5GC sends an
updated authorization status to the IAB-donor. When the authorization
status received by the IAB-donor changes, the IAB-donor performs the SA
equivalent of the steps described for NSA in clause 8.9.17.1.

In case the updated authorization status is "not authorized", after
actions described in clause 8.9.17.1 have been completed, the IAB-donor
may indicate to the 5GC that the IAB-MT can be de-registered.

##### 8.9.17.2.2 IAB-node is NR dual-connected

In case the IAB-node is dual-connected and the two parent nodes connect
to the same IAB-donor, the IAB-donor receives the authorization status
of the IAB-node from the 5GC. Upon reception of the authorization
status, the IAB-donor performs the same steps described in clause
8.9.17.2.1.

In case the IAB-node is dual-connected to a gNB and to an IAB-donor, the
MN receives the authorization status of the IAB-node from the 5GC. If
the MN is the gNB and the SN is the IAB-donor, the MN forwards the
authorization status to the SN in the S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST message or
S-NODE MODIFICATION REQUEST message. Upon reception of the authorization
status, the IAB-donor performs the same steps described in clause
8.9.17.2.1. If the updated authorization status is "not authorized", the
SN may indicate to the MN that the actions of removing the UEs and
descendant nodes, releasing the F1 interface and backhaul resources for
the IAB-node have been completed, by sending a S-NODE MODIFICATION
REQUIRED or S-NODE RELEASE REQUIRED message with the corresponding cause
value included. Then, the MN may indicate to the 5GC that the IAB-MT can
be de-registered. If the MN is the IAB-donor and the SN is the gNB, the
IAB-donor performs the same steps described in clause 8.9.17.2.1.

#### 8.9.17.3 IAB-node is served by two IAB-donors in SA

In case the IAB-MT only connects to the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor or
in case the IAB-MT is NR dual-connected with the non-F1-terminating
IAB-donor as the MN, the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor sends the
authorization status received from the 5GC to the F1-terminating
IAB-donor in the IAB-TRANPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

In case the IAB-MT only connects to the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor or
in case the IAB-MT is NR dual-connected, upon reception of the
authorization status, the F1-terminating IAB-donor performs the same
steps described in clause 8.9.17.2.1. If the authorization status is
"not authorized", the F1-terminating IAB-donor sends to the
non-F1-terminating IAB-donor an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT
REQUEST message requesting the release of all offloaded traffic, after
which the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor releases the offloaded traffic
and all backhaul resources, BAP address, TNL address and default BAP
configuration for the IAB-node. The F1-terminating IAB-donor or
non-F1-terminating IAB-donor then may indicate to the 5GC that the
IAB-MT can be de-registered.

8.10 Multiple TNLAs for E1
--------------------------

NOTE 0: The general principles and procedures described in this clause
also apply to ng-eNB and W1/E1 interface, i.e. W1 interface between
ng-eNB-DU and ng-eNB-CU-CP/ng-eNB-CU-UP, E1 interface between
ng-eNB-CU-CP and ng-eNB-CU-UP, if not explicitly specified otherwise.

In the following, the procedure for managing multiple TNLAs for E1 is
described.

Figure 8.10-1: Managing multiple TNLAs for E1.

1\. Either the gNB-CU-CP or gNB-CU-UP establishes the first SCTP
association with the gNB-CU-UP or gNB-CU-CP respectively using a
configured TNL address.

NOTE 1: The gNB-CU-UP/gNB-CU-CP may use different source and/or
destination IP end point(s) if the TNL establishment towards one IP end
point fails. How the gNB-CU-UP/gNB-CU-CP gets the remote IP end point(s)
and its own IP address are outside the scope of this specification.

2-3 (A). Once the TNLA (gNB-CU-UP initiated) has been established, the
gNB-CU-UP initiates the E1 Setup procedure to exchange application level
configuration data.

2-3 (B). Once the TNLA (gNB-CU-CP initiated) has been established, the
gNB-CU-CP initiates the E1 Setup procedure to exchange application level
configuration data.

4-6. The gNB-CU-CP may add additional SCTP Endpoint(s) to be used for E1
signalling between the gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP pair using the
gNB-CU-CP Configuration Update procedure. The gNB-CU-CP Configuration
Update procedure also allows the gNB-CU-CP to request the gNB-CU-UP to
modify or release TNLA(s).

7-9. The gNB-CU-UP may add additional TNL association(s) to be used for
E1 signalling *using a gNB-CU-CP endpoint already in use for existing
TNL associations* between the gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-UP pair. The
gNB-CU-UP CONFIGURATION UPDATE message including the gNB-CU-UP ID shall
be the first E1AP message sent on an additional TNLA of an already setup
E1 interface instance after the TNL association has become operational.
The E1AP UE TNLA binding is a binding between a E1AP UE association and
a specific TNL association for a given UE. After the E1AP UE TNLA
binding is created, the gNB-CU-CP can update the UE TNLA binding by
sending the E1AP message for the UE to the gNB-CU-UP via a different
TNLA. The gNB-CU-UP shall update the E1AP UE TNLA binding with the new
TNLA. The gNB-CU-UP Configuration Update procedure also allows the
gNB-CU-UP to inform the gNB-CU-CP that the indicated TNLA(s) will be
removed by the gNB-CU-UP.

8.11 Support of Network Sharing with multiple cell-ID broadcast
---------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.11.1 General

This clause describes necessary additions as compared to the case where
network sharing with multiple cell-ID broadcast is not applied.

The signalling flows in the subsequent clauses assuming 2 sharing
operators, PLMN A and PLMN B. For RAN sharing with multiple cell-ID
broadcast among PLMNs and NPNs or among NPNs, equivalent principles as
described in the example signalling flows below apply. The F1-C
signalling transport deployment used is indicated within the subsequent
clauses.

### 8.11.2 Initial Registration -- separate PLMN signalling

The signalling flow for Initial Registration for network sharing with
multiple cell-ID broadcast with separate per-PLMN signalling is shown in
Figure 8.11.2-1.

In this example message flow

\- the UE is assumed to not provide an ue-Identity from which the DU is
able to deduce the PLMN ID.

\- each F1-C interface instance uses a separate signalling transport or
share signalling transport with other F1-C interface instances.

\- the gNB-DU~A/B~ entity shown in Figure 8.11.2-1 is a simplified
representation of the gNB-DU~A~ of PLMN A, the gNB DU~B~ of PLMN B and
respective radio resources of the shared cell.

Figure 8.11.2-1: UE Initial Access procedure and network sharing with
multiple cell-ID broadcast

NOTE 1: Steps 1-5 are defined in clause 8.1. Note, that the
selectedPLMN-Identity is provided in step 5.

6\. The gNB-DU~A~ sends the F1AP UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message to
the gNB-CU~A~. including a Cause set to \"PLMN not served by the CU\".

7\. The gNB-DU~B~ sends the F1AP INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE to the
gNB-CU~B~. including the NR CGI associated with PLMN~B~, the C-RNTI
indicated by the gNB-DU~A~ at step 2, and the RRC-Container IE and the
*RRC-Container-RRCSetupComplete* IE with the RRC message received in
step1 and step 5 respectively. The *RRC-Container-RRCSetupComplete* IE
are included in the INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER for the case of
network sharing and shall contain the RRC messages received via the *RRC
UL-DCCH-Message* IE from the UE, but never previously sent to the
gNB-CU~B~.

8\. The gNB-CU~A~ sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the
gNB-DU.

9\. The gNB-DU sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message to the
gNB-CU~A~.

NOTE 2: Initiating procedures from gNB-DU~A~ towards gNB-CU~A~ and from
gNB-DU~B~ to gNB-CU~B~ in parallel is not precluded.

### 8.11.3 RRC Connection Reestablishment -- separate PLMN signalling

The signalling flow for RRC Connection Reestablishment for network
sharing with multiple cell-ID broadcast with separate per-PLMN
signalling is shown in Figure 8.11.3-1.

In this example message flow

\- each F1-C/Xn-C interface instance uses either a separate signalling
transport or a share signalling transport with other interface
instances.

\- the New gNB-DU~A/B~ entity shown in Figure 8.11.3-1 is a simplified
representation of the New gNB-DU~A~ of PLMN A, the New gNB DU~B~ of PLMN
B and respective radio resources of the shared cell.

Figure 8.11.3-1: RRC Connection Reestablishment and network sharing with
multiple cell-ID broadcast

1\. The UE sends the RRCReestablishmentRequest.

2A-5A. Depicts the case where the UE context could not be retrieved by
the new gNB-CUA. In step 2A, the NR CGI associated to PLMNA is
indicated. In step 5A, the gNB-CUA would prepare the possibility to
revert back to normal RRC Connection Establishment, indicating that the
UE Context was not retrieveable and may include the re-directed RRC
message as received in step 1. After step 5A, the gNB-DUA may redirect
the UE towards the PLMN indicated in DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message, if
the PLMN assistance information is provided by the gNB-CUA. If the New
gNB-DUA/B was not able to deduce the RRC message from step 1, this
indicator triggers step 2B. The New gNB-DUA is supposed to trigger the
release the UE-associated signalling connection (not shown).

2B-5B. Depicts the case where the UE context was retrieveable by the New
gNB-CU~B~. In step 2B, the NR CGI associated to PLMN~B~ is indicated.
Step 2B also includes the C-RNTI allocated at reception of step 1.

6-8. The RRC Connection Reestablishment continues with the New
gNB-CU~B~.

NOTE 1: If all gNB-CUs indicate that the UE context is not retrievable,
the RRC connection reestablishment falls back to RRC Connection setup,
as described in clause 8.11.2.

NOTE 2: Initiating procedures from gNB-DU~A~ towards gNB-CU~A~ and from
gNB-DU~B~ to gNB-CU~B~ in parallel is not precluded.

### 8.11.4 Support of shared signalling transport

This clause specifies for F1-C, Xn-C and, in case of EN-DC, for X2-C,
how an interface instance is identified in case of network sharing with
multiple cell ID broadcast with shared signalling transport.

For UE associated signalling, the interface instance is identified by
assigning on F1-C appropriate UE F1AP IDs, on Xn-C appropriate UE XnAP
IDs and on X2-C appropriate UE X2AP IDs.

For non-UE associated signalling, the interface instance is identified
on F1-C by the assigning an appropriate value to the Transaction ID, on
Xn-C and X2-C by including the Interface Instance Indication in the
respective message and assigning an appropriate value to it.

8.12 IAB-node Integration Procedure
-----------------------------------

### 8.12.1 Standalone IAB integration

A high-level flow chart for SA-based IAB integration is shown in the
Figure 8.12.1-1:

Figure 8.12.1-1: The integration procedure for IAB-node in SA

Phase 1: IAB-MT setup. In this phase, the IAB-MT of the new IAB-node
(e.g. IAB-node 2 in Figure 8.12.1-1) connects to the network in the same
way as a UE, by performing RRC connection setup procedure with
IAB-donor-CU, authentication with the core network, IAB-node 2-related
context management, IAB-node 2's access traffic-related radio bearer
configuration at the RAN side (SRBs and optionally DRBs), and,
optionally, OAM connectivity establishment by using the IAB-MT's PDU
session. The IAB-node can select the parent node for access based on an
over-the-air indication from potential parent node IAB-DU (transmitted
in SIB1). To indicate its IAB capability, the IAB-MT includes the
IAB-node indication in *RRCSetupComplete* message, to assist the
IAB-donor to select an AMF supporting IAB.

NOTE 1: The signalling flow for UE initial access procedure as shown in
Figure 8.1-1/Figure 8.9.1-1 is used for the setup of the IAB-MT.

Phase 2-1: BH RLC channel establishment. During the bootstrapping
procedure, one default BH RLC channel for non-UP traffic e.g. carrying
F1-C traffic/non-F1 traffic to and from the IAB-node 2 in the
integration phase, is established. This may require the setup of a new
BH RLC channel or modification of an existing BH RLC channel between
IAB-node 1 and IAB-donor-DU. The IAB-donor-CU may establish additional
(non-default) BH RLC channels. This phase also includes configuring the
BAP Address of the IAB-node 2 and default BAP Routing ID for the
upstream direction.

NOTE 2: If the OAM connectivity is supported via backhaul IP layer by
implementation, one or more BH RLC channels used for OAM traffic can
also be established.

Phase 2-2: Routing update. In this phase, the BAP sublayer is updated to
support routing between the new IAB-node 2 and the IAB-donor-DU. For the
downstream direction, the IAB-donor-CU initiates F1AP procedure to
configure the IAB-donor-DU with the mapping from IP header field(s) to
the BAP Routing ID related to IAB-node 2. The routing tables are updated
on all ancestor IAB-nodes (e.g. IAB-node 1 in Figure 8.12.1-1) and on
the IAB-donor-DU, with routing entries for the new BAP Routing ID(s).
This phase may also include the IP address allocation procedure for
IAB-node 2. IAB-node 2 may request one or more IP addresses from the
IAB-donor-CU via RRC. The IAB-donor-CU may send the IP address(es) to
the IAB-node 2 via RRC. The IAB-donor-CU may obtain the IP address(es)
from the IAB-donor-DU via F1-AP or by other means (e.g. OAM, DHCP). IP
address allocation procedure may occur at any time after RRC connection
has been established.

Phase 3: IAB-DU part setup. In this phase, the IAB-DU of IAB-node 2 is
configured via OAM. The IAB-DU of IAB-node 2 initiates the TNL
establishment, and F1 setup (as defined in clause 8.5) with the
IAB-donor-CU using the allocated IP address(es). The IAB-donor-CU
discovers collocation of IAB-MT and IAB-DU from the IAB-node's BAP
Address included in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message. After the F1 is set
up, the IAB-node 2 can start serving the UEs.

NOTE 3: The IAB-DU can discover the IAB-donor-CU's IP address in the
same manner as a non-IAB gNB-DU.

NOTE 4: If the IAB-node establishes NR-DC before the establishment of
F1-C connection, the MN decides whether the MN or the SN becomes the
F1-terminating IAB-donor. In case it decides that the SN becomes the
F1-terminating IAB-donor, it notifies the SN via Xn. The IAB-node can
implicitly derive whether the MN or the SN is the F1-terminating
IAB-donor, e.g., based on the entity which provides the default BAP
configuration.

NOTE 5: For OAM-based IAB-donor selection, if the IAB-node establishes
NR-DC before the establishment of F1-C connection, the IAB-node
indicates the F1-terminating IAB-donor by signaling its IP address(es)
to this IAB-donor via RRC signaling.

### 8.12.2 NSA IAB Integration procedure

The IAB integration procedure for NSA is shown in Figure 8.12.2-1.

Figure 8.12.2-1: Signalling flow for IAB integration procedure in NSA

Phase 1-1. IAB-MT part setup with E-UTRAN. In this phase, the IAB-MT
part connects to the LTE network as a UE, by performing RRC connection
setup procedure with an eNB, authentication with the EPC, IAB-node's
access traffic-related radio bearer configuration at the E-UTRAN side,
and optionally, OAM connectivity establishment by using the IAB-MT's PDN
connection. The IAB-node can select the IAB-supporting eNB based on an
over-the-air indication from eNB (transmitted in SIB1). To indicate its
IAB capability, the IAB-MT includes the IAB-node indication in
*RRCConnectionSetupComplete* message, to assist the eNB to select an MME
supporting IAB. The eNB then configures the IAB-MT part with an NR
measurement configuration in order to perform discovery, measurement and
measurement reporting of candidate gNBs. To enable the eNB choose an
en-gNB which supports IAB function, the IAB capability of neighbour gNBs
can be pre-configured in the eNB (e.g. by OAM).

NOTE: Other ways to enable the eNB know the IAB capability of neighbour
gNBs are not precluded.

Phase 1-2. SgNB addition. In this phase, the IAB-MT part connects to the
parent node IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU via the EN-DC SgNB Addition
procedure. The procedure defined in clause 8.4.1 is reused. The eNB
includes "*IAB Node Indication*" in SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message to
inform the IAB-donor-CU that the request is for an IAB-node. In
addition, SRB3 can be set up for the IAB-MT, to transmit RRC message
between the IAB-MT and the IAB-donor-CU via the NR links directly.

Phase 2-1: BH RLC channel establishment. This phase is the same as Phase
2-1 in the standalone IAB integration procedure (refer to the Phase 2-1
in clause 8.12.1). This step may occur in Phase 1-2.

Phase 2-2: Routing update. This phase is the same as Phase 2-2 in the
standalone IAB integration procedure (refer to the Phase 2-2 in clause
8.12.1), except that the IP traffic on the F1-C interface may be
transmitted via the MeNB.

Phase 3. IAB-DU part setup. This phase is the same as Phase 3 in the
standalone IAB integration procedure (refer to the Phase 3 in clause
8.12.1), except that the IP traffic on the F1-C interface may be
transmitted via the MeNB.

**The IAB-donor-CU decides to only configure LTE leg, or only to
configure NR leg, or to configure both LTE leg and NR leg, to be used
for F1-C traffic transfer. The configuration may be performed before
IAB-DU part setup. IAB-donor-CU may also change the configuration after
IAB-DU part setup. In case the configuration is not performed before
IAB-DU part setup, the IAB node uses the NR leg as the default one. When
both LTE leg and NR leg are configured, it is up to the implementation
to select the leg for F1-C traffic transfer.**

### 8.12.3 Mobile IAB-node integration

During the integration, the mobile IAB-MT and the mobile IAB-DU can
connect to the same IAB-donor or two different IAB-donors. The procedure
for the latter case is shown in Figure 8.12.3-1.

Figure 8.12.3-1: Decoupled mobile IAB-node integration procedure

Phase 1: Equivalent procedure to Phase 1 of the IAB-node integration in
SA mode in clause 8.12.1, where the mobile IAB-node and the
RRC-terminating IAB-donor correspond to IAB-node 2 and to the IAB-donor
respectively. The mobile IAB-node selects the parent node based on a
mobile-IAB-specific over-the-air indication (transmitted in SIB1). The
mobile IAB-MT includes a mobile-IAB-node-specific indication in the
*RRCSetupComplete* message to assist the RRC-terminating IAB-donor in
selecting an AMF that supports mobile IAB.

Phase 2-1: Same as Phase 2-1 of procedure in clause 8.12.1.

Phase 2-2: Same as Phase 2-2 of procedure in clause 8.12.1.

Phase 3: Mobile IAB-DU part setup. In this phase, the mobile IAB-DU is
configured via the OAM. The configured information includes, e.g., the
information of the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, to enable the mobile
IAB-DU to initiate the establishment of F1-C to the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU. The mobile IAB-DU initiates the TNL establishment, and F1
setup (as defined in clause 8.5) with the selected F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU using the default BAP routing ID and default BH RLC channel
configured by the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU in Phase 2-1 for upstream
traffic. During the F1 setup, the mobile IAB-DU includes the gNB ID of
the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU and the BAP address of the co-located
mobile IAB-MT in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message. The mobile IAB-node
determines this gNB ID based on the over-the-air broadcast (SIB1) by the
RRC-terminating IAB-donor.

After the F1 interface is set up, the mobile IAB-node can start serving
UEs. The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU can initiate the IAB Transport
Migration Management procedure towards the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU
as defined in clause 8.17.3.1. In case the IAB Transport Migration
Management procedure is the first XnAP procedure for the mobile IAB-MT,
the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU includes the mobile IAB-MT's BAP address
in the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT REQUEST message towards the
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

8.13 Overall procedures for MDT
-------------------------------

### 8.13.0 General

The following clauses describe the overall procedures for MDT (TS 37.320
\[31\]) involving E1 and F1.

### 8.13.1 Signalling based MDT activation

The signalling flow for Signalling based MDT activation triggered by AMF
involving E1 and F1 is shown in Figure 8.13.1-1.

Figure8.13.1-1 Signalling based MDT Activation

1\. The AMF sends a TRACE START message to the gNB. The AMF considers
MDT user consent information for the UE as defined in TS 32.422 \[20\].
TRACE START message includes the parameters for configuring MDT
measurements.

2\. The gNB-CU-CP decides if the gNB-CU-UP, or the gNB-DU, or both,
should be involved in the MDT measurement. If the gNB-CU-UP should be
involved in the MDT measurement, the gNB-CU-CP sends TRACE START message
to the gNB-CU-UP, including MDT configuration parameters.

3\. If the gNB-DU should be involved in the MDT measurement, the
gNB-CU-CP sends TRACE START message to the gNB-DU, including MDT
configuration parameters.

### 8.13.2 Management based MDT activation

#### 8.13.2.1 General

In Management Based Trace Activation towards a gNB-CU-CP, gNB-CU-UP or a
gNB-DU can be fulfilled with the Cell Traffic trace functionality
defined in TS 32.422 \[20\]. The configuration parameters of the Trace
Session that are received by a node in split RAN architecture are
defined in TS 32.422 \[20\].

The following description is valid for both an en-gNB and a gNB.

If the MDT measurement is initiated by the EM towards the gNB-CU-CP, and
if the activation involves measurements collected by multiple nodes
under the same gNB-CU-CP control in a split RAN architecture, the EM
sends MDT measurement activation to the gNB-CU-CP and the gNB-CU-CP may
further decide which gNB-DU(s) or which gNB-CU-UP(s) to perform the MDT
measurement.

When gNB-CU-CP or a gNB-DU receive the Trace Session Activation message
from the management system for a given cell or a list of cell(s) under
its control, the gNB-CU-CP or gNB-DU shall start a Trace Session for the
given cell or list of cell(s). For Management Based MDT sent directly to
a gNB-CU-UP, no MDT Area Configuration (apart from PLMN IDs) is to be
included in the MDT activation indication.

The signalling flows for management based MDT activation in gNB-CU-CP,
gNB-DU and gNB-CU-UP are shown in Figure 8.13.2.2-1, Figure 8.13.2.3-1
and in Figure 8.13.2.4-1 respectively.

#### 8.13.2.2 Management based MDT Activation in gNB-CU-CP

The signalling flow for Management based MDT Activation in gNB-CU-CP is
shown in Figure 8.13.2.2-1.

Figure 8.13.2.2-1 Management based MDT Activation in gNB-CU-CP

1\. The EM sends a Trace Session activation request to the gNB-CU-CP.
This request includes the parameters for configuring UE measurements.

2\. The gNB-CU-CP shall check the MDT user consent requirements
configured by OAM and select the suitable UEs for MDT data collection as
defined in TS 32.422 \[20\]. In particular, if the MDT configuration
contains both MDT measurements subject to user consent and not subject
to user consent, the gNB-CU-CP shall if supported:

\- If the MDT subscriber provided consent, start a Trace Session and
configure with all the MDT measurements in the Trace Session.

\- If the MDT subscriber did not provide consent, start a Trace Session
and configure with the MDT measurements not subject to user consent in
the Trace Session.

NOTE: Start of the Trace Session is subject to whether the protocol
information structure allows configuration of the selected MDT
measurements.

For each selected UE, if the gNB-CU-UP should perform MDT measurement,
the gNB-CU-CP sends TRACE START message to the gNB-CU-UP, including MDT
configuration parameters.

3\. For each selected UE, if the gNB-DU should perform MDT measurement,
the gNB-CU-CP sends TRACE START message to the gNB-DU, including MDT
configuration parameters.

4\. The gNB-CU-CP may send CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message to the AMF for the
selected UE, including Trace ID for MDT. The AMF forwards Trace ID and
other information to the TCE as specified in TS 32.422 \[20\].

If the UE reports an indication of measurement pollution, the gNB-CU-CP
shall, if supported, include such indication as part of the measurement
report to be sent to the TCE so that the TCE is able to correlate and
filter the affected measurements.

#### 8.13.2.3 Management based MDT Activation in gNB-DU

The signalling flow for Management based MDT Activation in gNB-DU is
shown in Figure 8.13.2.3-1.

Figure 8.13.2.3-1 Management based MDT Activation in gNB-DU

1\. The gNB-CU-CP sends UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the gNB-DU,
including Management based MDT PLMN List. The message may include the
*Polluted Measurement Indicator IE.* If the gNB-DU has received the
*Polluted Measurement Indicator* IE, the gNB-DU includes the information
contained in such indicator as part of the measurement report to be sent
to the TCE, so that the TCE is able to correlate and filter the affected
measurements.

2\. The gNB-DU sends UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message to the gNB-CU-CP.

3\. The EM sends a Trace Session activation request to the gNB-DU. This
request includes the parameters for configuring UE measurements.

4\. The gNB-DU shall check the MDT user consent requirements configured
by OAM and select the suitable UEs for MDT data collection as defined in
TS 32.422 \[20\]. In particular, if the MDT configuration contains both
MDT measurements subject to user consent and not subject to user
consent, the gNB-DU shall if supported:

\- If the MDT subscriber provided consent, start a Trace Session and
configure with all the MDT measurements in the Trace Session.

\- If the MDT subscriber did not provide consent, start a Trace Session
and configure with the MDT measurements not subject to user consent in
the Trace Session.

NOTE: Start of the Trace Session is subject to whether the protocol
information structure allows configuration of the selected MDT
measurements.

For each selected UE, the gNB-DU may send CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message to
the gNB-CU-CP in the F1 UE associated signalling, including Trace ID for
MDT.

5\. Upon reception of a CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message from F1, the
gNB-CU-CP shall send CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message to the AMF for this UE,
including Trace ID for MDT. The AMF forwards Trace ID and other
information to the TCE as specified in TS 32.422 \[20\].

#### 8.13.2.4 Management based MDT Activation in gNB-CU-UP

The signalling flow for Management based MDT Activation in gNB-CU-UP is
shown in Figure 8.13.2.4-1.

Figure 8.13.2.4-1 Management based MDT Activation in gNB-CU-UP

1\. The gNB-CU-CP sends BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the
gNB-CU-UP, including Management based MDT PLMN List. The message may
include *Polluted Measurement Indicator.* If the gNB-DU has received the
*Polluted Measurement Indicator* IE, the gNB-DU includes the information
contained in such indicator as part of the measurement report to be sent
to the TCE so that the TCE is able to correlate and filter the affected
measurements.

2\. The gNB-CU-UP sends BEARER CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message to the
gNB-CU-CP.

3\. The EM sends a Trace Session activation request to the gNB-CU-UP.
This request includes the parameters for configuring UE measurements.

4\. The gNB-CU-UP shall check the MDT user consent requirements
configured by OAM and select the suitable UEs for MDT data collection as
defined in TS 32.422 \[20\]. In particular, if the MDT configuration
contains both MDT measurements subject to user consent and not subject
to user consent, the gNB-CU-UP shall if supported:

\- If the MDT subscriber provided consent, start a Trace Session and
configure with all the MDT measurements in the Trace Session.

\- If the MDT subscriber did not provide consent, start a Trace Session
and configure with the MDT measurements not subject to user consent in
the Trace Session.

NOTE: Start of the Trace Session is subject to whether the protocol
information structure allows configuration of the selected MDT
measurements.

For each selected UE, the gNB-CU-UP may send CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message
to the gNB-CU-CP in the E1 UE associated signalling, including Trace ID
for MDT

5\. Upon reception of a CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message from E1, the
gNB-CU-CP shall send CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message to the AMF for this UE,
including Trace ID for MDT. The AMF forwards Trace ID and other
information to the TCE as specified in TS 32.422 \[20\].

#### 8.13.2.5 User consent propagation in EN-DC

In the EN-DC case, the EM provides the MDT configuration to both MeNB
and en-gNB independently.

As specified in TS 32.422 \[20\] in Management based MDT getting user
consent is required before activating the MDT functionality because of
privacy and legal obligations. In the case of EN-DC user consent gets
communicated to the MeNB at the UE context setup procedure using the
INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message. In particular when the Management
Based MDT Allowed IE is contained in the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
message, the MeNB stores it in the UE context and uses it, together with
information in the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE, if available, to
allow subsequent selection of the UE for management based MDT as
specified in TS 32.422 \[20\]. The MeNB may also receive user consent
information in the HANDOVER REQUEST message. The MeNB will forward the
MDT user consent to the SgNB at EN-DC setup. In particular, if available
in the UE context, the MeNB will include the Management Based MDT
Allowed IE and the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE in the SGNB
ADDITION REQUEST message to the SgNB. Furthermore, the user consent will
be forwarded to the relevant gNB-CU-UP at the bearer context setup or to
the gNB-DU by including the Management Based MDT PLMN List IE in the
BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST or UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST.

The signalling flow for User consent proposation in EN-DC is shown in
Figure 8.13.2.5-1.

Figure 8.13.2.5-1 User consent propagation in EN-DC

0\. User Context information are made available at the MME.

1\. The MME sends INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the MeNB,
including Management Based MDT Allowed IE and the Management based MDT
PLMN List IE to communicate user consent to the eNB.

2\. The MeNB sends SGNB ADDITION REQUEST to the gNB-CU-CP at EN-DC
setup. This request includes Management Based MDT Allowed IE and,
optionally, the Management based MDT PLMN List IE, if available.

3a. The user consent is communicated to the gNB-DU at the UE context
setup by including the Management based MDT PLMN List IE in the UE
CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST.

3b. The user consent is communicated to the gNB-CU-UP at the bearer
context setup by including the Management based MDT PLMN List IE in the
BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST.

#### 8.13.2.6 User consent propagation in MR-DC with 5GC

As specified in TS 32.422 \[20\] in Management based MDT getting user
consent is required before activating the MDT functionality because of
privacy and legal obligations. User consent is communicated to the MN at
the UE context setup procedure using the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST
message, or in HANDOVER REQUEST and PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
messages. Modified user consent information may be received in the UE
CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message. The MN stores the received
information in the UE context and uses it to allow subsequent selection
of the UE for management based MDT as specified in TS 32.422 \[20\]. The
MN will forward the MDT user consent to the SN at MR-DC setup, i.e., if
available in the UE context, the MN will include the Management Based
MDT PLMN List IE in the S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST message or in the S-NODE
MODIFICATION REQUEST message sent to the SN. Furthermore, in NR-DC and
NGEN-DC, the user consent will be forwarded to the relevant SgNB-CU-UP
at the bearer context setup or to the SgNB-DU by including the
Management Based MDT PLMN List information in the BEARER CONTEXT SETUP
REQUEST or UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST. Furthermore, in NR-DC and NGEN-DC,
the user consent may be updated to the relevant SgNB-CU-UP at the bearer
context modification or to the SgNB-DU by including the Management Based
MDT PLMN List information in the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST or
UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST.

The signalling flow for User consent propagation in NR-DC and NGEN-DC is
shown in Figure 8.13.2.6-1.

Figure 8.13.2.6-1 User consent propagation in NR-DC and NGEN-DC

0\. User Context information are made available at the AMF.

1\. The AMF sends INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the MN,
including the Management based MDT PLMN List IE to communicate user
consent to the MN.

2\. The MN sends S-NODE ADDITION REQUEST to the SgNB-CU-CP at NR-DC
setup. This request includes the Management based MDT PLMN List IE.

3a. The user consent is communicated to the SgNB-DU at the UE context
setup by including the Management based MDT PLMN List IE in the UE
CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST.

3b. The user consent is communicated to the SgNB-CU-UP at the bearer
context setup by including the Management based MDT PLMN List IE in the
BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST.

#### 8.13.2.7 Management based trace activation in MR-DC with 5GC

In the MR-DC with 5GC case, the EM provides the MDT configuration to
both MN and SN independently.

In Management Based Trace Activation towards a SN, the SN may send the
CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message including the Trace ID and privacy indicator
to the MN as described in TS 32.422 \[20\]. Upon reception of the CELL
TRAFFIC TRACE message from the SN, the MN will send a CELL TRAFFIC TRACE
message including the Trace ID and privacy indicator to the CN for this
UE. The CN forwards the Trace ID and other information to the TCE as
specified in TS 32.422 \[20\].

The following shows a flow chart summarizing the functionality in MR-DC
when the SN is the SgNB.

Figure 8.13.2.7-1 Data anonymization in MR-DC when the SN is the SgNB

0\. The gNB-CU-CP, the gNB-CU-UP, the gNB-DU receives the MDT
configuration from EM and select the suitable UEs for MDT data
collection. The anonymization MDT configuration parameter from the EM is
considered to be IMEI-TAC.

1\. For the management based MDT activation in gNB-CU-UP and/or in
gNB-DU, if the gNB-CU-UP and/or the gNB-DU receive an MDT Configuration
including the anonymization parameter set to IMEI-TAC, the gNB-CU-UP
and/or gNB-DU send CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message to the gNB-CU-CP for this
UE, including Trace ID and privacy indicator.

2\. For the management based MDT activation in gNB-CU-CP, upon receiving
the CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message from E1/F1, the gNB-CU-CP shall send a
CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message to the MN for this UE, including Trace ID and
privacy indicator.

3\. The MN sends a CELL TRAFFIC TRACE message to the CN for this UE,
including Trace ID and privacy indicator. The CN forwards Trace ID and
other information to the TCE as specified in TS 32.422 \[20\].

### 8.13.3 Alignment of MDT and QoE Measurements

In case of split gNB architecture, the gNB-CU-CP can send the TRACE
START message for the MDT measurement subject to alignment with a QoE
measurement to the gNB-CU-UP and gNB-DU, e.g., upon/after the reception
of QoE measurement session start indication from the UE, as specified in
TS 38.300 \[2\].

### 8.13.4 MDT reporting

Each node involved in the MDT measurement reports the measurements
collected directly to the TCE the node has been configured with.

In the case where issues (e.g. in-device coexistence problem)
potentially affecting immediate MDT measurements were detected during a
measurement reporting process, an indication of the issue should be
logged in the affected measurement reports to the TCE so that the TCE is
able to correlate and filter the affected measurements.

8.14 Self-optimisation

### 8.14.1 Overall procedures for MRO

The following clauses describe the overall procedures for MRO involving
F1.

#### 8.14.1.1 Signalling of RLF information from gNB-CU to gNB-DU

The signalling flow for signalling of RLF information from gNB-CU to
gNB-DU is shown in Figure 8.14.1.1-1, where the example where NG-RAN
nodes exchange the RLF Report via the Xn: FAILURE INDICATION message has
been considered.

Figure 8.14.1.1-1 Example of signalling of RLF information from gNB-CU
to gNB-DU in NG RAN

1\. A UE with a logged RLF Report connects to a cell in gNB2 and it
signals the RLF Report to gNB2 by means of the RRC UE Information
Request/Response procedures.

2\. The gNB2 sends an Xn: Failure Indication to gNB1-CU where the UE may
have previously been connected prior to the connection failure. This
includes also the RLF Report.

3\. The gNB1-CU sends the F1: Access and Mobility Indication message to
the gNB1-DU, including the RLF Report.

It is also possible for the gNB-CU receiving the RLF Report from the UE
to signal it directly to the gNB-DU by means of the F1: Access and
Mobility Indication procedure.

#### 8.14.1.2 Signalling of RACH information from gNB-CU to gNB-DU

The signalling flow for signalling of RACH information from gNB-CU to
gNB-DU is shown in Figure 8.14.1.2-1, where the example where NG-RAN
nodes exchange the RACH Report via the Xn: ACCESS AND MOBILITY
INDICATION message has been considered.

Figure 8.14.1.2-1 Example of signalling of RACH information from gNB-CU
to gNB-DU in NG-RAN

1\. A UE with a RACH Report concerning cells of gNB1 connects to a cell
in gNB2 and it signals the RACH Report to gNB2 by means of the RRC UE
Information Request/Response procedures.

2\. GNB2 sends an Xn: Access and Mobility Indication message to gNB1-CU
where the UE may have previously been connected. This includes also the
RACH Report.

3\. GNB1-CU sends the F1: Access and Mobility Indication message to the
gNB1-DU, including the RACH Report.

It is also possible for the gNB-CU receiving the RACH Report from the UE
to signal it directly to the gNB-DU by means of the F1: Access and
Mobility Indication procedure.

#### 8.14.1.3 Reporting of DL LBT failure information from gNB-DU to gNB-CU

For MRO analysis, a gNB-CU may request to a gNB-DU to collect and report
DL LBT failure information related to mobility failures for a UE, as
defined in TS 38.300 \[2\], via the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message, or
the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message, or to trigger report via
the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND. The gNB-DU may report the information to
the gNB-CU via the DU-CU ACCESS AND MOBILITY INDICATION message.

8.15 Overall procedures for NR MBS
----------------------------------

### 8.15.1 General

The following clauses describe the overall procedures for NR MBS
involving E1 and F1.

#### 8.15.1.1 Broadcast MBS Session Setup

Figure 8.15.1.1-1 illustrates an exemplified interaction of NGAP, E1AP,
F1AP and RRC protocol functions at Broadcast MBS Session Setup.

Figure 8.15.1.1-1: Broadcast MBS Session Setup

1\. The 5GC starts the broadcast session by sending the NGAP Broadcast
Session Setup Request message to the gNB containing e.g. the TMGI,
S-NSSAI, 5G QoS Profile, area information and transport information (for
NG-U multicast transport it provides the IP multicast address and the IP
source specific multicast address).

2/3. The gNB-CU-CP sets up the broadcast bearer context, providing NG-U
transport information from the 5GC to the gNB-CU-UP, receiving from the
gNB-CU-UP the NG-U GTP DL TEID and storing it in case NG-U unicast
transport was selected and an F1-U GTP UL TEID per MRB.

4\. In case of NG-U multicast transport, the gNB-CU-UP joins the NG-U
multicast group.

5/6. The gNB-CU-CP establishes the Broadcast MBS Session Context at the
gNB-DU, providing e.g. MRB configuration, other relevant session
parameters and F1-U GTP UL TEID information, and receiving F1-U GTP DL
TEID information.

7/8. The gNB-CU-CP triggers BC Bearer Context Modification Request
towards the gNB-CU-UP to provide the F1-U GTP DL TEID information.

9\. The gNB-DU configures broadcast resources and provides broadcast
configuration information to the UEs by means of MCCH.

10\. The gNB-CU CP successfully terminates the NGAP broadcast Session
Setup procedure. In case the gNB has chosen NG-U unicast transport, NG-U
GTP DL TEID information is provided to the 5GC.

11\. The broadcast MBS media stream is provided to the UEs.

On NG-U, in case of location dependent broadcast MBS Sessions, multiple
shared NG-U transport tunnels may need to be setup, one per Area Session
ID served by the gNB.

In case of shared NG-U termination,

\- the gNB-CU-UP may provide the gNB-CU-CP at E1 setup or configuration
update about established shared NG-U terminations, indicated by one or
several MBS Session IDs.

\- at establishment of the BC bearer context in the gNB-CU-UP, the
gNB-CU-CP may request the gNB-CU-UP to either apply the available MRB
configuration of the shared NG-U termination, or to apply the MRB
configuration requested by the gNB-CU-CP. The gNB-CU-UP provides the MRB
configuration to the gNB-CU-CP if the MRB configuration requested by the
gNB-CU-CP and the available MRB configuration of the shared NG-U
termination are different.

#### 8.15.1.1a Broadcast MBS Session Setup for resource efficiency for MOCN

Figure 8.15.1.1a-1 illustrates an exemplified interaction of NGAP, E1AP,
F1AP and RRC protocol functions at Broadcast MBS Session Setup with the
support of resource efficiency for MOCN.

Figure 8.15.1.1a-1: Broadcast MBS Session Setup for resource efficiency
for MOCN

1\. The 5GC1 triggers the Broadcast MBS Session Setup procedure for TMGI
1 as defined in section 8.15.1.1, and the Associated Session ID x is
provided together with TMGI 1 in step 1, 2 and 5 of 8.15.1.1. The
broadcast MBS media stream received from 5GC1 is provided to the UEs of
PLMN1.

2\. The 5GC2 triggers the Broadcast MBS Session Setup procedure for TMGI
2 with the Associated Session ID x.

3\. Upon receiving the same Associated Session ID x, the gNB-CU-CP may
determine to not establish shared NG-U tunnel for PLMN2 with 5GC2, in
case of multicast transport, the gNB-CU-CP stores the multicast
transport address received from the 5GC2.

4\. The gNB-CU-CP triggers the F1AP Broadcast Context Setup Request for
TMGI 2 with the Associated Session ID x towards the gNB-DU.

5\. Upon receiving the same Associated Session ID x, the gNB-DU shall
determine to not establish shared F1-U tunnel for PLMN2.

6\. The gNB-DU triggers the F1AP Broadcast Context Setup Response for
TMGI 2 to the gNB-CU, and indicates that the shared F1-U tunnel is not
established.

7\. The gNB-DU provides configuration of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 by means
of MCCH. The broadcast MBS media stream received from 5GC1 is provided
to both UEs of PLMN1 and UEs of PLMN2.

8\. The gNB-CU-CP sends NGAP Broadcast Session Setup Response towards
5GC2.

Afterwards, if the gNB-CU-CP decides (e.g., in case the 5GC1 triggers
Broadcast Session Release) to establish shared NG-U resources with the
5GC2 with which the shared NG-U was not established:

\- in case of multicast transport, the gNB-CU-CP triggers BC Bearer
Context Modification Request towards the gNB-CU-UP providing the stored
multicast address received from the 5GC2. Then the gNB-CU-UP joins the
NG-U multicast group of 5GC2 accordingly;

\- in case of unicast transport, the gNB-CU-CP triggers Broadcast
Session Transport Request towards the core network providing the unicast
transport address received from the gNB-CU-UP.

NOTE: The gNB CU-UP may support PDCP SN continuity after establishment
of shared NG-U resources with 5GC2.

#### 8.15.1.1b Broadcast MBS Session Setup for resource efficiency for RAN sharing with multiple cell-ID broadcast

Figure 8.15.1.1b-1 illustrates an exemplified interaction of NGAP, E1AP,
F1AP and RRC protocol functions at Broadcast MBS Session Setup with the
support of resource efficiency for RAN sharing with multiple cell-ID
broadcast.

The gNB-DU~1/2~ entity shown in Figure 8.15.1b-1 is a simplified
representation of the gNB-DU~1~ of PLMN 1, the gNB DU~2~ of PLMN 2 and
respective radio resources of the shared cell.

Figure 8.15.1.1b-1: Broadcast MBS Session Setup for RAN sharing with
multiple cell-ID broadcast

1\. The 5GC1 triggers the Broadcast MBS Session Setup procedure towards
gNB-CU-CP1 for TMGI 1 as defined in section 8.15.1.1, and the Associated
Session ID x is provided together with TMGI 1 in step 1, 2 and 5 of
8.15.1.1. The broadcast MBS media stream received from 5GC1 is provided
to the UEs of PLMN1 via the gNB-CU-UP1 and the gNB-DU~1~.

2\. The 5GC2 triggers the Broadcast MBS Session Setup procedure for TMGI
2 with the Associated Session ID x towards gNB-CU-CP2.

3/4. The gNB-CU-CP2 sets up the broadcast bearer context with gNB-CU-UP2
including the Associated Session ID x. The gNB-CU UP uses the received
information to correlate the MBS sessions and include the shared NG-U
termination endpoint if applicable.

5\. The gNB-CU-CP2 triggers the F1AP Broadcast Context Setup Request for
TMGI 2 with the Associated Session ID x towards the gNB-DU~2~.

6\. Upon receiving the same Associated Session ID x, the gNB-DU~1/2~ may
determine to not establish shared F1-U tunnel for PLMN2.

7\. The gNB-DU~2~ triggers the F1AP Broadcast Context Setup Response for
TMGI2 to the gNB-CU-CP2, and indicates that the shared F1-U tunnel is
not established.

8\. The gNB-CU-CP2 may determine to not establish shared NG-U tunnel for
PLMN2. In case of multicast transport, the gNB-CU-CP2 stores the NG-U
multicast transport address received from 5GC2 in step 2. In case of
unicast transport, the gNB-CU-CP2 stores the NG-U unicast transport
address received from the gNB-CU-UP2 in step 4.

9/10. The gNB-CU-CP2 triggers E1AP BC Bearer Context Modification
procedure towards the gNB-CU-UP2, and indicates that the shared F1-U
tunnel is not established.

11\. The gNB-DU~1/2~ provides configuration of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 by
means of MCCH. The broadcast MBS media stream received from 5GC1 is
provided to both UEs of PLMN1 and UEs of PLMN2.

12\. The gNB-CU-CP2 sends NGAP Broadcast Session Setup Response towards
5GC2.

Afterwards, if the gNB-DU~1/2~ decides (e.g., upon receiving the
Broadcast Context Release Command from gNB-CU-CP1 in case the 5GC1
triggers Broadcast Session Release) to establish the shared F1-U tunnel
for PLMN2 which was not established:

\- the gNB-DU~2~ triggers Broadcast Transport Resource Request towards
the gNB-CU-CP2 and providing the F1-U TNL at DU;

\- and then, the gNB-CU-CP2 triggers the BC Bearer Context Modification
Request towards the gNB-CU-UP2 providing the F1-U TNL at DU,

\- in case of multicast transport, the gNB-CU-CP2 also provides the
stored NG-U multicast transport address received from 5GC2. Then the
gNB-CU-UP2 joins the NG-U multicast group of 5GC2 accordingly;

\- in case of unicast transport, the gNB-CU-CP2 triggers the Broadcast
Session Transport procedure towards the 5GC2 providing the stored NG-U
unicast transport address received from gNB-CU-UP2.

#### 8.15.1.2 Multicast MBS Session Context Establishment

Figure 8.15.1.2-1 illustrates an exemplified interaction of NGAP, E1AP,
F1AP and RRC protocol functions for Multicast MBS Session Context
Establishment with a UE joining an active multicast session as the first
UE joining in its serving gNB.

Figure 8.15.1.2-1: Multicast MBS Session Context establishment

0\. For a certain multicast MBS session (TMGI), which is currently
active, no multicast MBS session context is yet established in the gNB.

1\. The UE joins the multicast session.

NOTE 1: NAS related details for PDU Session signalling are not shown in
Figure 8.15.1.2-1.

2/3. The gNB-CU-CP establishes the multicast bearer context at the
gNB-CU-UP. For unicast NG-U transport the GTP DL TEID is retrieved.

4/5. The gNB-CU CP triggers the NGAP Distribution Setup procedure. For
unicast NG-U transport, DL GTP TEID is provided to the 5GC. For
multicast NG-U transport, multicast address information is retrieved
from the 5GC. Multicast session QoS parameters are provided by the 5GC.

5a/5b. The gNB-CU-CP triggers the setup of MRB resources via the E1AP MC
Bearer Context Modification procedure. For multicast NG-U transport the
5GC shared NG-U multicast address information is provided to the
gNB-CU-UP. Multicast session QoS parameters are provided to the
gNB-CU-UP.

6/7. The gNB-CU-CP establishes the Multicast Context at the gNB-DU,
providing MRB configuration. It may contain MBS Area Session ID
information.

8/9. The gNB-CU-CP retrieves the MRB configuration for the joined UE
from the gNB-DU via F1 UE Context Management procedures.

NOTE 2: The interactions between the gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP for UE
specific Berarer Context management before and after step 8/9 are not
illustrated in this Figure.

10\. The gNB-DU triggers the establishment of F1-U resources, which are
established either per gNB-DU or per cell or per MBS Area Session ID.

11/12. The gNB-CU-UP side of the F1-U is established by means of the
E1AP MC Bearer Context Modification procedure, providing the gNB-DU side
F1-U TNL to the gNB-CU-UP, which provides the gNB-CU-UP side F1-U TNL
address in return.

13\. The gNB-CU-UP side F1-U TNL address is provided to the gNB-DU.

14\. In case of NG-U multicast transport, the gNB-CU-UP joins the NG-U
multicast group.

15\. The gNB successfully terminates the NGAP procedure for establishing
the multicast session context.

16\. The gNB-CU-CP RRC-configures each UE which has joined the multicast
group.

17\. The multicast MBS media stream is provided to the UEs.

On NG-U, in case of location dependent multicast MBS Sessions, multiple
shared NG-U transport tunnels may need to be setup, one per Area Session
ID served by the gNB.

In case of shared NG-U termination,

\- the gNB-CU-UP may provide the gNB-CU-CP at E1 setup or configuration
update about established shared NG-U terminations, indicated by one or
several MBS Session IDs.

\- at establishment of the MC bearer context in the gNB-CU-UP, the
gNB-CU- CP may request the gNB-CU-UP to either apply the available MRB
configuration of the shared NG-U termination, or to apply the MRB
configuration requested by the gNB-CU-CP. The gNB-CU-UP provides the MRB
configuration to the gNB-CU-CP if the MRB configuration requested by the
gNB-CU-CP and the available MRB configuration of the shared NG-U
termination are different.

#### 8.15.1.3 Multicast MRB type re-configuration with F1-U ptp-retransmission tunnel establishment

Figure 8.15.1.3-1: Multicast MRB type re-configuration with F1-U ptp
retransmission tunnel establishment

1\. The gNB-DU decides to change the MRB type configuration for a UE and
provides the new configuration to the gNB-CU-CP along with a per-MRB MRB
type reconfiguration indication and the MRB Reconfigured RLC mode.

2\. The gNB-CU-CP confirms the modification request and indicates this
to the gNB-DU. The gNB-CU-CP may request the gNB-DU to establish F1-U
ptp retransmission resources in order for the UE to perform PDCP Status
Report and receive retransmitted PDCP PDUs for the reconfigured MRBs.

4\. - 7. If necessary, the gNB-DU requests the establishment of F1-U
resources for ptp retransmission by means of triggering the F1AP
Multicast Distribution Setup procedure, which in turn triggers the E1AP
MC Bearer Context Modification procedure to exchange F1-U tunnel
end-point addresses.

NOTE: Depending on MRB bearer type reconfiguration the gNB-DU may also
request to release some F1-U resources.

8./9. The RRC Reconfiguration procedure is performed

10\. PDCP Status Report and PDCP PDU retransmission can take place via
the established F1-U ptp retransmission resources.

### 8.15.2 Mobility procedure for Multicast

#### 8.15.2.1 Inter-gNB-CU Mobility between MBS Supporting nodes

Figure 8.15.2.1-1 shows the inter-gNB-CU multicast mobility procedure
between MBS Supporting nodes during an active multicast session.

Figure 8.15.2.1-1: Inter-gNB-CU Mobility for Multicast

1\. The Source gNB-CU-CP sends MC BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST
message towards the Source gNB-CU-UP, to request the last delivered MRB
Progress of an MBS Session related to a Multicast F1-U Context Reference
E1.

2\. The Source gNB-CU-UP responds to the gNB-CU-CP in the MC BEARER
CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message, providing the last delievered MRB
Progress.

3\. The source gNB-CU-CP sends the HANDOVER REQUEST message to the
target gNB-CU-CP with the last delievered MRB progress for the Multicast
sessions the UE has joined.

4\. In case the Multicast session which the UE has joined was not
established in the target cell, the target gNB-CU-CP triggers the
Multicast MBS Session Context Establishment procedure as defined in
section 8.15.1.2.

5\. The target gNB-CU-CP triggers MC BEARER CONTET SETUP REQUEST message
towards the target gNB-CU-UP.

6\. The target gNB-CU-UP responds to the target gNB-CU-CP by sending the
MC BEARER CONTET SETUP RESPONSE message.

7\. The target gNB-CU-CP sends UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST towards the
target gNB-DU. If the target gNB-CU-CP has decided to request a PTP
Forwarding tunnel, the message contains the PTP Forwarding Tunnel
Required indication and the last delivered MRB Progress for the MRBs
requested to be configured.

8\. The target gNB-DU sends UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE towards the target
gNB-CU-CP.

9\. If a PTP Forwarding Tunnel was requested in step 7, the target
gNB-DU shall, if supported, trigger the F1-U tunnel establishment via
MULTICAST DISTRIBUTION SETUP REQUEST, including the F1-U DL UP TNL
information and the last delievered MRB Progress for the each of the
MRB.

10\. The target gNB-CU-CP sends the MC BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION
REQUEST towards the target gNB-CU-UP, including for each MRB a request
for the oldest availiable MRB Progress information, the last delivered
MRB Progress, and the F1-U DL UP TNL information.

11\. Based on the information received in step 10, the target gNB-CU-UP
determines whether the Xn-U data forwarding is needed or not, and in
case it is needed, provide for each MRB the oldest available MRB
Progress and the assigned XN-U DL Forwarding UP TNL Info to the target
gNB-CU-CP in the MC BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.

12\. In case step 9 was triggerred, the target gNB-CU-CP sends the
MULTICAST DISTRIBUTION SETUP RESPONSE to the target gNB-DU.

13\. The target gNB-CU-CP sends HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE to the
source gNB-CU-CP, including the XN-U DL Forwarding UP TNL Info and the
oldest available MRB Progress for each MRB.

14\. The source gNB-CU-CP forwards the XN-U DL Forwarding UP TNL Info
and the oldest available MRB Progress for each MRB to the source
gNB-CU-UP via MC BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

15\. The source gNB-CU-UP sends the MC BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION
RESPONSE message to the source gNB-CU-CP.

16\. The source gNB-CU-UP starts to forward MBS data towards the target
gNB-CU-UP.

NOTE: step 16 may happen before or after or in parallel with step 15.

17\. If a PTP Forwarding Tunnel was established, the target gNB-CU-UP
sends the forwarding data to the target gNB-DU.

8.16 Overall procedures for CPAC
--------------------------------

The following clauses describe the overall procedures for CPAC involving
E1 and F1.

### 8.16.1 MN initiated Conditional PSCell Addition

The procedure for MN initiated Conditional PSCell Addition (CPA) is
shown in Figure 8.16-1-1.

Figure 8.16.1-1 Conditional Secondary Node Addition procedure

1-12. The steps 1-12 are as defined in TS 37.340 \[12\].

a1-a5. The steps a1-a5 are as defined in clause 8.9.2 and with
conditional indications.

a6. After Random Access procedure successfully performed at the
candidate gNB-DU which becomes the target SN gNB-DU, the target gNB-DU
sends a Downlink Data Delivery Status frame to inform the target
gNB-CU-UP. The target gNB-DU also sends an ACCESS SUCCESS message to
inform the target gNB-CU-CP of which cell the UE has successfully
accessed.

### 8.16.2 MN initiated conditional SN Change

The procedure for MN initiated conditional SN Change refer to TS
37.340\[12\]. In case of split gNB architecture, the procedures between
gNB-CU and gNB-DU and the procedures between gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP
refer to 8.16.1.

### 8.16.3 SN initiated conditional inter-SN Change

The procedure for SN initiated conditional SN Change refer to TS
37.340\[12\]. In case of split gNB architecture, the procedures between
gNB-CU and gNB-DU and the procedures between gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP
refer to 8.16.1.

8.17 IAB Inter-CU Topology Management
-------------------------------------

### 8.17.1 IAB Inter-donor-DU Re-routing

When an IAB-donor-DU is configured to support inter-donor-DU re-routing,
the IAB-donor-DU may identify a re-routed UL IP packet based on the
source IP address field of the UL packet, and forwards UL IP packets,
whose source IP addresses are anchored at a peer IAB-donor-DU, to this
peer IAB-donor-DU via a tunnel. The IAB-donor-DU and the peer
IAB-donor-DU may be controlled by the same IAB-donor-CU or by two
different IAB-donor-CUs. The inter-donor-DU tunnel may be a GTP-U
tunnel. The configuration of the tunnel is up to implementation. At the
IAB-donor-DU forwarding the UL IP packets, inter-donor-DU tunnelling may
be restricted to only a subset of the IP addresses anchored at the peer
IAB-donor-DU. For this purpose, the IAB-donor-CU configures the
IAB-donor-DU for forwarding the UL IP packets with a list of TNL
addresses and/or prefixes for which tunnelling should be permitted and
TNL address filtering should be exempted.

NOTE: Tunnel **types other** than GTP-U may be used for the
inter-donor-DU tunnel, by implementation.

### 8.17.2 IAB Inter-CU Topology Redundancy

#### 8.17.2.1 IAB Inter-CU topological redundancy procedure

The inter-CU topological redundancy procedure enables the establishment,
modification and release of redundant paths in IAB-topologies underneath
different IAB-donor-CUs. Since topological redundancy uses NR-DC for the
IAB-MT, it is only supported for IAB-nodes operating in the SA mode.

Figure 8.17.2.1-1 shows an example of the inter-CU topological
redundancy procedure, where a second backhaul path is established for a
dual-connecting IAB-node via a separate IAB-topology that is not
controlled by the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU. The dual-connecting
IAB-DU retains the F1 connection with the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.
Since the dual-connecting IAB-MT also maintains an RRC connection with
the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, this procedure renders the
dual-connecting IAB-node as a boundary IAB-node.

Figure 8.17.2.1-1 IAB inter-CU topology redundancy procedure

1\. The NR-DC establishment procedure is performed for the IAB-MT of the
dual-connecting IAB-node as described in TS 37.340 \[12\], clause 10.2.
This procedure can be conducted before or after establishment of the F1
interface between the IAB-DU and an IAB-donor-CU.

2\. The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU sends an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION
MANAGEMENT REQUEST message to the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU to
provide the context of the traffic to be offloaded.

3\. The non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU sends a DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message to the second parent IAB-DU, which includes an
RRCReconfiguration message for the dual-connecting IAB-MT. The RRC
configuration includes a BAP address for the boundary node, pertaining
to the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU's topology. The RRC configuration
may include new TNL address(es) for the dual-connecting IAB-node,
anchored at the second-path, i.e., at the IAB-donor-DU under the
non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU. In case IPsec tunnel mode is used to
protect the F1 and non-F1 traffic, the new TNL address refers to the
outer IP address.

4\. The second parent IAB-DU forwards the received RRCReconfiguration
message to the dual-connecting IAB-MT.

5\. The dual-connecting IAB-MT responds to the second parent IAB-DU with
an RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

6\. The second parent IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to
the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, to convey the received
RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

7\. The non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may configure or modify BH RLC
channels and BAP-sublayer routing entries on the second path between the
dual-connecting IAB-node and the second-path IAB-donor-DU, as well as DL
mappings on the second-path IAB-donor-DU for the dual-connecting
IAB-node's second path. The DL mappings may be based on the TNL
address(es) allocated to the dual-connecting IAB-node in step 3. These
configurations may support the transport of UP and non-UP traffic on the
second path.

8\. The non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU responds with an IAB TRANSPORT
MIGRATION MANAGEMENT RESPONSE message to the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU, to provide the mapping information for the traffic to be
offloaded as indicated in step 2. The message includes the L2 info
necessary to configure the dual-connecting IAB-node with the UL mappings
for this traffic. The message includes the DSCP/IPv6 Flow Label values
to be used for the DL traffic to be offloaded.

9\. The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU updates the boundary node with the
UL BH information received from the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU in
Step 8 for the traffic to be offloaded. This step may also update UL
FTEID and DL FTEID associated with individual GTP-tunnel(s). The
affected GTP tunnel(s) will be switched to use the dual-connecting
IAB-node's new TNL address(es). This step may use non-UE associated
signaling in E1 and/or F1 interface to provide updated UP configuration
for F1-U tunnels of multiple connected UEs or child IAB-MTs.
Implementation must ensure the avoidance of potential race conditions,
i.e., that no conflicting configurations are concurrently performed
using UE-associated and non-UE-associated procedures.

The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may also provide UL BH information
associated with non-UP traffic. New TNL addresses for F1-C traffic
configured in step 3, if any, can be added to the dual-connecting
IAB-DU's F1-C association(s) with the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP
association(s) between the dual-connecting IAB-node and the
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may be established using the new TNL address
information of the dual-connecting IAB-node. The dual-connecting
IAB-node sends an F1AP gNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, which may include new (outer) IP addresses
and corresponding new (inner) IP address for offloaded F1-U traffic.

NOTE: The IP address selected by the boundary IAB-node for a traffic
needs to be anchored at the IAB-donor-DU whose BAP address is contained
in the BAP routing ID of the UL mapping for this traffic, and configured
by the IAB-donor (MN/SN) of the egress topology of the traffic.

10\. The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU sends an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION
MANAGEMENT REQUEST message to the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, to
modify the context of the dual-connecting IAB-node's offloaded traffic.
The message may include the DL TNL address information used for the
offloaded traffic and reported by the boundary node in step 9. The
non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may use this information to configure DL
mappings on the second-path IAB-donor-DU.

11\. The non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU responds with an IAB TRANSPORT
MIGRATION MANAGEMENT RESPONSE message to the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU.

12\. The steps above, may be repeated, except step 1, if needed, for the
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU to request addition, modification, or
release of the offloaded traffic. The non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU
can fully or partially reject the addition or modification requested by
the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

The non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may request the modification of the
L2 transport for the offloaded traffic in the non-F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU's topology using the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message. The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU reconfigures UL BH
mappings accordingly and acknowledges the modification via the IAB
TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION RESPONSE message. The
non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may further reconfigure the TNL
addresses of the dual-connecting IAB-node via RRC.

The traffic offload for descendant nodes follows the same procedure as
defined for the partial migration in clause 8.17.3.2.

The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may request full or partial release of
the offloaded traffic from the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU by
initiating the IAB Transport Migration Management procedure towards the
non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU (e.g., for the purpose of revoking, or
in case UE bearers are released).

The traffic offload for the dual-connecting IAB-node and the descendent
nodes can be partially or fully revoked, resulting in the return of the
offloaded traffic back to the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU's topology.
Full or partial traffic revoking can be initiated by the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU by initiating the IAB Transport Migration Management
procedure towards the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU. The
non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU can request partial or full revoking of
traffic offload from the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU by initiating the
IAB Transport Migration Modification procedure towards the
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

### 8.17.3 IAB Inter-CU Topology Adaptation

#### 8.17.3.1 IAB inter-CU topology adaptation procedure

During the inter-CU topology adaptation for a single-connected IAB-node,
the IAB-MT migrates from an old parent node to a new parent node, where
the old and the new parent nodes are served by different IAB-donor-CUs.
Without loss of generality, the old parent node is referred to as source
parent node, and the new parent node is referred to as target parent
node.

Figure 8.17.3.1-1 shows an example of the topology adaptation procedure,
where the IAB-MT is migrated from a source IAB-donor-CU to a target
IAB-donor-CU. In this procedure, the migrating IAB-node becomes a
boundary IAB-node since its IAB-DU retains F1AP with the source
IAB-donor-CU while its IAB-MT obtains RRC connectivity with the target
IAB-donor-CU.

Figure 8.17.3.1-1: IAB inter-CU topology adaptation procedure

1\. The source IAB-donor-CU sends an Xn HANDOVER REQUEST message to the
target IAB-donor-CU . This message may include the migrating IAB-node's
TNL address information in the RRC container.

2\. The target IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to
the target parent node IAB-DU, to create the UE context for the
migrating IAB-MT and to set up the bearers, which the migrating IAB-MT
uses for its signaling, and, optionally, data traffic.

3\. The target parent node IAB-DU responds to the target IAB-donor-CU
with a UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message.

4\. The target IAB-donor-CU performs admission control and provides the
new RRC configuration as part of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message. The RRC configuration includes a BAP address for the boundary
node in the target IAB-donor-CU's topology, a default BH RLC channel and
a default BAP routing ID configuration for UL F1-C/non-F1 traffic
mapping on the target path. The RRC configuration may include the new
TNL address(es) anchored at the target IAB-donor-DU for the migrating
node.

5\. The source IAB-donor-CU sends a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST
message to the source parent node IAB-DU, which includes the received
RRCReconfiguration message from the target IAB-donor-CU.

6\. The source parent node IAB-DU forwards the received
RRCReconfiguration message to the migrating IAB-MT.

7\. The source parent node IAB-DU responds to the source IAB-donor-CU
with the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message.

8\. The migrating IAB-MT performs a random access procedure at the
target parent node IAB-DU.

9\. The migrating IAB-MT responds to the target parent node IAB-DU with
an RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

10\. The target parent node IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message to the target IAB-donor-CU, to convey the received
RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

11\. The target IAB-donor-CU triggers the path switch procedure for the
migrating IAB-MT, if needed.

12\. The target IAB-donor-CU sends UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to the
source IAB-donor-CU.

NOTE: The XnAP UE IDs of the migrating node are retained at target and
source IAB-donor-CU as long as the target path is used for transport of
traffic between the migrating node and the source IAB-donor-CU.

13\. The source IAB-donor-CU may release BH RLC channels and
BAP-sublayer routing entries on the source path between source parent
IAB-node of the migrating IAB-node and the source IAB-donor-DU.

14\. The target IAB-donor-CU configures BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer
routing entries on the target path between the migrating IAB-node and
target IAB-donor-DU, as well as DL mappings on the target IAB-donor-DU
for the migrating IAB-node's target path. These configurations support
the transport of F1-C traffic on the target path.

15\. The F1-C connection between the migrating IAB-node and the source
IAB-donor-CU are switched to the target path using the new TNL address
information of the migrating IAB-node. The migrating IAB-node may report
the new TNL address information it wants to use for F1-U traffic to the
source IAB-donor-CU, via the gNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.

In case IPsec tunnel mode is used for TNL protection, the migrating
IAB-node may use MOBIKE (IETF RFC 4555 \[29\]) to migrate the IPsec
tunnel to the new IP outer addresses. After the completion of the MOBIKE
procedure, the migrating IAB-DU initiates an F1AP gNB-DU Configuration
Update procedure from which the IAB-donor-CU can conclude whether the
existing inner IP address(es) (e.g., for SCTP association) and the DL
F-TEID can be reused.

If new TNL addresses for F1-C traffic are configured, new SCTP
association(s) between the migrating IAB-node and the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU may be established using the new TNL address information of
the migrating IAB-node. The migrating IAB-node sends an F1AP gNB-DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, which
may include new (outer) IP addresses and corresponding new (inner) IP
address for the F1-U traffic to be switched to the target path.

16\. The source IAB-donor-CU sends an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT
REQUEST message to the target IAB-donor-CU, to provide the context of
the traffic to be offloaded. The message may include the new DL TNL
address information necessary for the target IAB-donor-CU to configure
or modify DL mappings on the target IAB-donor-DU.

17\. The target IAB-donor-CU may configure or modify BH RLC channels and
BAP-sublayer routing entries on the target path between the migrating
IAB-node and target IAB-donor-DU, as well as DL mappings on the target
IAB-donor-DU for the migrating IAB-node's target path. These
configurations may support the transport of UP and non-UP traffic on the
target path.

18\. The target IAB-donor-CU responds to the source IAB-donor-CU with an
IAB Transport Migration Management Response message, to provide the
mapping information for the traffic to be offloaded. The message
includes the L2 info that is used in the target IAB-donor-CU's topology
and necessary to configure the migrating IAB-node with the UL mappings
of traffic indicated in step 16. The message includes the DSCP/IPv6 Flow
Label values used to configure the DL mappings of traffic indicated in
step 16.

19\. The F1-U connections of the migrating IAB-node with the source
IAB-donor-CU are switched to use the migrating IAB-node's new TNL
address(es). The source IAB-donor-CU provides to the IAB-DU of the
migrating IAB-node the updated UL BH information for the traffic
indicated in step 16, based on the UL BH information received from the
target IAB-donor-CU in step 18. The source IAB-donor-CU may also update
the UL BH information associated with non-UP traffic. This step may use
UE associated signaling or non-UE associated signaling in E1 and/or F1
interface. Implementation must ensure the avoidance of potential race
conditions, i.e., that no conflicting configurations are concurrently
performed using UE-associated and non-UE-associated procedures.

20\. The steps 16 to 19 may be repeated, if needed, where the source
IAB-donor-CU can request the offload of further traffic, or the
modification or release of offloaded traffic. The target IAB-donor-CU
can fully or partially reject addition or modification requests by the
source IAB-donor-CU.

The target IAB-donor-CU may request the modification of the L2 transport
for the offloaded traffic in the target IAB-donor-CU's topology using
the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION REQUEST message. The source
IAB-donor-CU reconfigures the UL BH mappings accordingly, and
acknowledges the modification via the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION
MODIFICATION RESPONSE message. The target IAB-donor-CU may further
reconfigure the TNL addresses of the migrating IAB-node via RRC.

The traffic offload through the inter-CU topology adaptation procedure
for the migrating IAB-node can be fully revoked.

The non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU can initiate the full revoking of
traffic offload by executing the XnAP Handover Preparation procedure for
the migrating IAB-MT. After the migrating IAB-MT is handed over in
reverse direction, i.e., from the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU to the
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, the traffic of the migrating IAB-node's
IAB-DU is routed again along the former source path.

The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU can initiate the full revoking of
traffic offload by requesting the release of all offloaded traffic from
the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU by sending the IAB TRANSPORT
MIGRATION MANAGEMENT REQUEST to the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.
This message may trigger the XnAP Handover Preparation procedure for the
migrating IAB-MT towards the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may request full or partial release of
the offloaded traffic from the non-F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU via the
IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT REQUEST message.

#### 8.17.3.2 IAB inter-CU topology adaptation procedure with descendant IAB-node

Figure 8.17.3.2-1 shows an example of the topology adaptation procedure
where the migrating IAB-MT is migrated from a source IAB-donor-CU to a
target IAB-donor-CU, and where the migrating IAB-node has a descendant
IAB-node which retains both its RRC connection and F1 connection with
the source IAB-donor-CU.

Figure 8.17.3.2-1: IAB inter-CU topology adaptation procedure with
descendant IAB-node

0\. The topology adaptation procedure of clause 8.17.3.1 is performed
for the migrating IAB-node.

1\. The source IAB-donor-CU sends an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT
REQUEST message to the target IAB-donor-CU to provide the context of the
descendant IAB-node's traffic to be offloaded. The message may include a
request for new TNL address(es) for the descendant IAB-node(s), anchored
at a target IAB-donor-DU. The source IAB-donor-CU includes an identifier
of the migrating IAB-node in the request message. This could be
performed in parallel with step 0 after the source IAB-donor-CU receives
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, e.g., the context of the traffic
to be offloaded for the migrating/descendant nodes and IP address
request information could be contained in the same IAB TRANSPORT
MIGRATION MANAGEMENT REQUEST message.

2\. The target IAB-donor-CU determines the target IAB-donor-DU, based on
the identifier of the migrating IAB-node. The target IAB-donor-CU may
configure or modify BH RLC channels and BAP-sublayer routing entries on
the target path between the boundary IAB-node and target IAB-donor-DU,
as well as DL mappings on the target IAB-donor-DU for the migrating
IAB-node's target path. These configurations may support the transport
of UP and non-UP traffic on the target path.

3\. The target IAB-donor-CU may obtain new TNL address(es) from the
target IAB-donor-DU, based on the request for TNL address(es) received
in step 1.

4\. The target IAB-donor-CU responds with an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE message to the source IAB-donor-CU, to provide the
mapping information for the traffic to be offloaded. The message
includes the L2 info from the target IAB-donor-CU topology that is
necessary to configure the migrating IAB-node with the BAP-sublayer
routing, header-rewriting and BH RLC CH mapping entries of traffic
indicated in step 1. The message includes the DSCP/IPv6 Flow Label
values to be used for the DL traffic to be offloaded as indicated in
step 1. The message may include the new TNL address(es) obtained in step
3, if any.

NOTE 1: The target IAB-donor-CU should select the same IAB-donor-DU in
its IAB topology for all to-be-offloaded traffic, whose UL BH mappings
received from the source IAB-donor-CU in step 1 share the same BAP
address.

NOTE 2: The target IAB-donor-CU should provide the same Egress BAP
Routing ID for all to-be-offloaded uplink traffic, whose UL BH mappings
received from the source IAB-donor-CU in step 1 share the same Ingress
BAP Routing ID.

5\. The source IAB-donor-CU configures the migrating IAB-node's IAB-DU
with the BAP-sublayer routing, header-rewriting and BH RLC CH mapping
entries of the migrating IAB-node.

6\. The source IAB-donor-CU sends a DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to
the descendant IAB-node's parent IAB-DU, which includes an
RRCReconfiguration message for the descendant IAB-MT. The RRC
configuration may include the new TNL addresses received in step 4. If
needed, the source IAB-donor-CU may also provide a new default UL
mapping which includes a default BH RLC channel and a default BAP
Routing ID on the target path, to the descendant nodes via
RRCReconfiguration message.

7\. The descendant IAB-node's parent IAB-DU forwards the received
RRCReconfiguration message to the descendant IAB-MT.

8\. The descendant IAB-MT responds to the migrating IAB-node's IAB-DU
with an RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

9\. The migrating IAB-node's IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER
message to the source IAB-donor-CU, to convey the received
RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

10\. If needed, the source IAB-donor-CU configures UL BH mappings on the
descendant node and BAP-sublayer routing entries between the descendant
node and the migrating IAB-node. This step may be performed at an
earlier stage, e.g., immediately after step 4.

11\. The F1-C connections and F1-U tunnels are switched to use the
descendant IAB-node's new TNL address(es), if any, as described in Steps
15 and 19 of the inter-CU topology adaptation procedure in clause
8.17.3.1.

NOTE- 3: The IP address selected by the descendant IAB-node for an
offloaded traffic needs to be anchored at the IAB-donor-DU whose BAP
address is contained in the BAP routing ID of the UL mapping for this
traffic, and obtained in step 7.

12\. The source IAB-donor-CU sends an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT
REQUEST message to the target IAB-donor-CU, to modify the context of the
descendant IAB-node's offloaded traffic. The message may include the DL
TNL address information received in step 11 that is necessary for the
target IAB-donor-CU to configure or modify DL mappings on the target
IAB-donor-DU.

13\. The target IAB-donor-CU responds with an IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE message to the source IAB-donor-CU.

14\. The of steps above may be repeated, if needed, for the source
IAB-donor-CU to request addition, modification or release of the
offloaded traffic pertaining to the descendant IAB-node. The target
IAB-donor-CU can fully or partially reject addition or modification
requests by the source IAB-donor-CU.

The target IAB-donor-CU may trigger the modification of the L2 transport
of the offloaded traffic in the target IAB-donor-CU's topology using the
IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION REQUEST message. Based on this
message, the source IAB-donor-CU may reconfigure the UL BH mappings on
the descendant nodes, the routing entries and BH RLC channel mappings on
the migrating node and the descendant nodes, and the BAP header
rewriting entries on the migrating node, and acknowledges the
modification via the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message. The target IAB-donor-CU may further provide updated TNL address
information for the descendant IAB-node to the source IAB-donor-CU.

The full or partial release or revoking of traffic offload pertaining to
the descendant IAB-nodes and their served UEs follows the same procedure
as defined for the partial migration in clause 8.17.3.1.

### 8.17.4 IAB Inter-CU Backhaul RLF recovery for single connected IAB-node

The inter-CU backhaul RLF recovery procedure for IAB-nodes in SA mode
enables recovery of an IAB-node to another parent node underneath a
different IAB-donor-CU, when the IAB-MT of the IAB-node detects backhaul
RLF.

Figure 8.17.4-1 shows an example of the backhaul RLF recovery procedure
for an IAB-node in SA mode. In this example, the IAB-node changes from
its initial parent node to a new parent node, where the new parent node
is served by a different IAB-donor-CU than that serving its initial
parent node. In this procedure, the recovering IAB-node becomes a
boundary IAB-node since the IAB-DU retains F1AP with the initial
IAB-donor-CU while its IAB-MT obtains RRC connectivity with the new
IAB-donor-CU.

Figure 8.17.4-1: IAB inter-CU backhaul RLF recovery procedure for an
IAB-node in SA mode

1\. The IAB-MT of the IAB-node detects backhaul RLF.

2\. The IAB-MT attempts RLF recovery by performing Random Access towards
a new parent IAB-DU.

3\. The IAB-MT undergoing RLF recovery sends an
RRCReestablishmentRequest message to the new parent IAB-DU.

4\. The new parent IAB-DU sends an INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE to the new
IAB-donor-CU, to convey the received RRCReestablishmentRequest message.

5\. The new IAB-donor-CU retrieves the UE Context for the IAB-MT
undergoing recovery, through the XnAP Retrieve UE Context procedure. The
initial IAB-donor-CU may include the TNL address information of the
IAB-node undergoing recovery in the RRC container of the RETRIEVE UE
CONTEXT RESPONSE message.

6\. The new IAB-donor-CU sends a DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the
new parent IAB-DU, to convey the generated RRCReestablishment message.

7\. The new parent IAB-DU sends an RRCReestablishment message to the
IAB-MT undergoing recovery.

8\. The IAB-MT undergoing recovery sends an RRCReestablishmentComplete
message to the new parent IAB-DU.

9\. The new parent IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to
the new IAB-donor-CU, to convey the received RRCReestablishmentComplete
message.

10\. The new IAB-donor-CU triggers the UE Context Setup procedure toward
the new parent IAB-DU, to create the UE context for the IAB-MT
undergoing recovery and to set up one or more bearers. These bearers can
be used by the IAB-MT undergoing recovery for its own signalling, and,
optionally, data traffic.

11\. The new IAB-donor-CU triggers the path switch procedure for the
IAB-MT undergoing recovery, if needed.

12\. The new IAB-donor-CU sends UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to the
initial IAB-donor-CU.

NOTE: The XnAP UE IDs of the boundary IAB-MT are retained at initial
IAB-donor-CU and new IAB-donor-CU as long as the recovery path is used
for transport of traffic between the IAB-node undergoing recovery and
the initial IAB-donor-CU.

13\. The initial IAB-donor-CU may release the BH RLC channels and
BAP-sublayer routing entries on the initial path between the initial
parent IAB-node and the initial IAB-donor-DU.

14\. The new IAB-donor-CU sends a DL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the
new parent IAB-DU, which includes an RRCReconfiguration message for the
IAB-MT undergoing recovery. The RRC configuration may include new TNL
addresses anchored at the new IAB-donor-DU. The RRC configuration may
further include a BAP address for the recovery IAB-node in the new
IAB-donor-CU's topology, default BH RLC channel and a default BAP
routing ID configuration for UL F1-C/non-F1 traffic mapping on the
recovery path.

15\. The new parent IAB-DU forwards the received RRCReconfiguration
message to the IAB-MT undergoing recovery.

16\. The IAB-MT undergoing recovery responds to the new parent IAB-DU
with an RRCReconfigurationComplete message.

17\. The new parent IAB-DU sends an UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to
the new IAB-donor-CU, to convey the received RRCReconfigurationComplete
message.

18\. The remaining part of the procedure follows the steps 14-20 of the
inter-CU topology adaptation procedure defined in clause 8.17.3.1.

Traffic offload for descendant nodes follows the same procedure as that
of clause 8.17.3.2.

The new IAB-donor-CU may request the modification of the L2 transport of
the offloaded traffic in the new IAB-donor-CU's topology. The new
IAB-donor-CU may further reconfigure the TNL addresses of the boundary
IAB-node via RRC.

The traffic offload due to inter-CU RLF recovery procedure for the
boundary IAB-node and its descendant IAB-nodes can be fully revoked. In
this case, the boundary IAB-MT is handed over in reverse direction,
i.e., from the new IAB-donor-CU to the initial IAB-donor-CU, and the
traffic of the boundary IAB-DU and the descendant IAB-DUs is routed
again along the initial path used prior to BH RLF recovery.

The new IAB-donor-CU can initiate the full revoking of traffic offload
by executing the XnAP Handover Preparation procedure for the boundary
IAB-MT towards the initial IAB-donor-CU.

The initial IAB-donor-CU can initiate the full revoking of traffic
offload in the same manner as described in clause 8.17.3.1 for the
revoking initiated by the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

The initial IAB-donor-CU may request full or partial release of the
offloaded traffic from the new IAB-donor-CU via the IAB TRANSPORT
MIGRATION MANAGEMENT REQUEST message.

8.18 Overall procedure for Small Data Transmission during RRC Inactive
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.18.1 RACH based SDT

The procedure for RACH based small data transmission in RRC Inactive is
shown in Figure 8.18.1-1.

Figure 8.18.1-1: RACH based Small Data Transmission in RRC Inactive
state.

1\. The UE in RRC Inactive sends the *RRCResumeRequest* message together
with UL SDT data and/or UL SDT signalling.

2\. The gNB-DU buffers the UL SDT data and/or UL SDT signalling.

3\. The step 3 is as defined in step 4 in clause 8.6.2, including an
indication of SDT access. The gNB-DU may also provide SDT assistance
information.

4-5. If UE context is successfully retrieved as specified in TS 38.300
\[2\], the steps 4-5 are as defined in steps 6-7 in clause 8.9.6.2. The
UL SDT data, if any, is forwarded to the gNB-CU-UP, and the UL
signalling, if any, is forwarded to the gNB-CU-CP via the UL RRC MESSAGE
TRANSFER message, in which any UL NAS PDU is delivered to AMF.

NOTE 1: In case that full UE context is retrieved from another gNB-CU-CP
as specified in TS 38.300 \[2\], the gNB-CU-CP first establishes the UE
context in the gNB-CU-UP via the Bearer Context Setup procedure and F1-U
UL TEIDs are retrieved before step 4. The BEARER CONTEXT SETUP REQUSET
message may include an indication to suspend non-SDT bearers, and in
this case, the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message in step 6
does not include resume indication for SDT DRBs.

NOTE 2: In case that only partial UE context for SDT including F1-U UL
TEIDs is retrieved from another gNB-CU-CP as specified in TS 38.300
\[2\], the gNB-CU-CP uses those F1-U UL TEIDs for steps 4-5, and the
subsequent steps 6-7 are not executed. The F1-U DL TEIDs received from
the gNB-DU in step 5 should be forwarded to the other gNB-CU-CP, to be
used for transferring of the DL SDT data. In addition, the UL SDT data,
if any, is forwarded from the gNB-DU to the gNB-CU-UP of the other
gNB-CU-CP for which the partial context is retrieved, and the UL
signalling, if any, is forwarded from the gNB-CU-CP to the other
gNB-CU-CP (the last serving gNB-CU-CP) via the XnAP RRC TRANSFER
message.

NOTE 3: The other gNB-CU-UP may need to buffer the UL SDT data if
received before the SDT bearer(s) are resumed.

6\. The gNB-CU-CP sends the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message
including an resume indication for SDT DRBs. The gNB-CU-CP also includes
the F1-U DL TEIDs received from the gNB-DU in step 5.

7\. The gNB-CU-UP responds with the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE
message.

NOTE 4: void.

Upon receiving the UE INACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message without SDT volume
threshold crossed indication from the gNB-DU, the gNB-CU, if serving the
UE and deciding to terminate the ongoing SDT procedure, shall transmit
the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the gNB-DU.

If CG-SDT is (re-)configured, the gNB-CU may request the gNB-DU to keep
CG-SDT configuration and resources in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND
message.

NOTE 5: void.

Upon receiving BSR from the UE, in case that UL SDT data size in the BSR
is larger than the threshold configured from the gNB-CU-CP, the gNB-DU
sends the UE INACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message with the SDT volume
threshold crossed indication to the gNB-CU-CP. Upon receiving such
indication, the gNB-CU-CP may terminate the ongoing SDT procedure, by
sending the *RRCResume* message to move the UE to RRC\_CONNECTED, or by
sending the *RRCRelease* message to move the UE to RRC\_INACTIVE, or by
sending the *RRCRelease* message with resume indication to trigger the
UE to initiate RRC Resume procedure to move to RRC\_CONNECTED state as
specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

Upon receiving DL non-SDT data, the gNB-CU-UP shall send the DL DATA
NOTIFICATION message to the gNB-CU-CP. The gNB-CU-CP shall terminate the
ongoing SDT procedure as specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

If the amount of the received DL SDT data is above the data size
threshold configured by the gNB-CU-CP, the gNB-CU-UP shall send the DL
DATA NOTIFICATION message with the SDT data size threshold crossed
indication. The gNB-CU-CP may terminate the ongoing SDT procedure as
specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

In case that the gNB-CU-CP terminates the ongoing SDT procedure by
sending the *RRCResume* message to move the UE to RRC\_CONNECTED as
specified in TS 38.300 \[2\], if non-SDT bearer(s) has been configured
but suspended in the gNB-CU-UP, the gNB-CU-CP triggers the Bearer
Context Modification procedure to the gNB-CU-UP to resume all bearers.

### 8.18.2 CG based SDT

The procedure for CG based small data transmission in RRC Inactive is
shown in Figure 8.18.2-1.

Figure 8.18.2-1: CG based Small Data Transmission in RRC Inactive state.

1\. The gNB-CU decides to move UE into RRC\_INACTIVE state.

2\. The gNB-CU-CP decides to configure CG-SDT, it sends UE CONTEXT
MODIFICATION REQUEST message including a query indication for CG-SDT
related resource configuration associated with the information of SDT
Radio Bearer(s).

3\. The gNB-DU sends the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message
including the CG-SDT related resource configurations for the requested
SDT Radio Bearer(s) within the *DU to CU RRC Information* IE.

4\. The gNB-CU-CP sends the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST towards
the gNB-CU-UP, with the suspend indication.

5\. The gNB-CU-UP sends the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE towards
the gNB-CU-CP.

6\. The gNB-CU-CP sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the
gNB-DU including an *RRCRelease* message to the UE with the CG-SDT
information within suspend configuration. The gNB-CU notifies the gNB-DU
to keep the SDT RLC config, F1-U tunnels, F1AP UE association, and store
the CG resource for SDT when the UE is entering RRC\_INACTIVE state with
an explicit CG-SDT kept indicator.

7\. The gNB-DU sends the *RRCRelease* message to UE.

8\. The gNB-DU sends UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message. The gNB-DU
keeps the SDT RLC config, F1-U tunnels, F1AP UE association, and stores
the CG resource for SDT when the UE entering RRC\_INACTIVE. The gNB-DU
also stores the C-RNTI, CG-SDT-CS-RNTI, and which bearers are CG-SDT
bearers.

After a period of time of the UE being in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

9\. The UE decides to perform CG based SDT procedure, it sends the
*RRCResumeRequest* message together with UL SDT data/UL NAS PDU.

10.The gNB-DU sends the UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message including the
*RRCResumeRequest* message to indicate the access due to CG-SDT.

11/12. If UE context is successfully retrieved as specified in TS 38.300
\[2\], the gNB-CU-CP initiates the BEARER CONTEXT MODIFICATION procedure
to resume SDT DRBs.

13 -- 13a. The gNB-DU sends the UL SDT data, if any, to the gNB-CU-UP,
and/or sends the UL signalling, if any, to the gNB-CU-CP via the UL RRC
MESSAGE TRANSFER message, in which any UL NAS PDU is delivered to AMF.

NOTE 1: void.

Upon receiving the UE INACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message without SDT volume
threshold crossed indication from the gNB-DU and deciding to terminate
the ongoing SDT procedure, the gNB-CU shall transmit the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE COMMAND message to the gNB-DU.

NOTE 2: void.

Upon receiving BSR from the UE, in case that UL SDT data size in the BSR
is larger than the threshold configured from the gNB-CU-CP, the gNB-DU
sends the UE INACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message with the SDT volume
threshold crossed indication to the gNB-CU-CP. Upon receiving such
indication, the gNB-CU-CP may terminate the ongoing SDT procedure, by
sending the *RRCResume* message to move the UE to RRC\_CONNECTED.

If CG-SDT is re-configured, the gNB-CU may request the gNB-DU to keep
CG-SDT configuration and resources in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND
message.

Upon receiving DL non-SDT data, the gNB-CU-UP shall send the DL DATA
NOTIFICATION message to the gNB-CU-CP. The gNB-CU-CP shall terminate the
ongoing SDT procedure as specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

If the amount of the received DL SDT data is above the data size
threshold configured by the gNB-CU-CP, the gNB-CU-UP shall send the DL
DATA NOTIFICATION message with the SDT data size threshold crossed
indication. The gNB-CU-CP may terminate the ongoing SDT procedure as
specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

In case that the gNB-CU-CP terminates the ongoing SDT procedure by
sending the *RRCResume* message to move the UE to RRC\_CONNECTED as
specified in TS 38.300 \[2\], if non-SDT bearer(s) has been configured
but suspended in the gNB-CU-UP, the gNB-CU-CP triggers the Bearer
Context Modification procedure to the gNB-CU-UP to resume all bearers.

### 8.18.3 RA-SDT or non-SDT with CG-SDT configuration

The procedure for the case where the UE has CG-SDT resource
configurations but decides to perform RACH based small data transmission
in RRC Inactive or to perform RACH procedure to transit to RRC Connected
(see TS 38.321 \[30\] clause 5.27) is shown in Figure 8.18.3-1.

Figure 8.18.3-1: RA-SDT or non-SDT with CG-SDT configuration.

1\. The UE in RRC Inactive sends *RRCResumeRequest* message. If the UE
decides to perform RACH based SDT procedure, it also sends UL SDT data
and/or UL SDT signalling.

2\. The gNB-DU buffers the UL SDT data and/or UL SDT signalling.

3\. The gNB-DU sends the INITIAL UL RRC MESSAGE TRANSFER message to the
gNB-CU-CP, including a new gNB-DU UE F1AP ID, and in case of RACH based
SDT access, the gNB-DU provides an indication of SDT access and may also
the SDT assistance information.

4\. If UE context is successfully retrieved as specified in TS 38.300
\[2\], the gNB-CU-CP sends the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message with the
stored (or retrieved from the last serving gNB) F1 UL TEIDs and the new
gNB-DU UE F1AP ID received in step 3.

In case that the gNB-DU is the one that sent the RRCRelease message with
CG-SDT resource configurations to the UE, the gNB-CU-CP also includes
the old gNB-DU UE F1AP ID and the old gNB-CU F1AP UE ID within the Old
CG-SDT Session Info IE of the UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message.

In case that the gNB-CU-CP is the one that generated the RRCRelease
message with CG-SDT resource configurations but the gNB-DU is not the
old gNB-DU that sent the RRCRelease message to the UE, the gNB-CU-CP
initiates the UE Context Release procedure by sending the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE COMMAND message to the old gNB-DU.

In case that the UE accesses a gNB other than the last serving gNB, upon
receiving the RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message from the receiving
gNB-CU-CP, the last serving gNB-CU-CP initiates the UE Context Release
procedure by sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the last
serving gNB-DU.

5\. The gNB-DU sends the UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message with the new
gNB-DU UE F1AP ID. In case the old gNB-DU UE F1AP ID is received within
the *Old CG-SDT Session Info* IE in step 4, the gNB-DU retrieves the
stored CG-SDT resource configurations and UE context based on the *Old
CG-SDT Session Info* IE, if any, and associates them with the new gNB-DU
F1AP UE ID.

### 8.18.4 MT-SDT

The procedure for mobile terminated small data transmission in RRC
Inactive is shown in Figure 8.18.4-1.

Figure 8.18.4-1: Mobile Terminated Small Data Transmission in RRC
Inactive state.

1\. During the setup or modification of the bearer context as specified
in 8.9.2, the gNB-CU-CP requests the gNB-CU-UP to provide MT-SDT
information.

2a-0. The gNB-CU-UP receives DL data for the UE in RRC Inactive on NG-U
interface.

2a-1. The gNB-CU-UP sends DL DATA NOTIFICATION message to the gNB-CU-CP.
If determining that DL data packets are only mapped to SDT bearers, as
requested in step 1, the gNB-CU-UP includes the MT-SDT information in
the DL DATA NOTIFICATION message.

2b. The gNB-CU-CP receives DL NAS signalling or RAN PAGING REQUEST
message over NGAP.

2c. The gNB-CU-CP receives the MT-SDT information in XnAP RAN PAGING
message.

3\. After 2a or 2b or 2c, the gNB-CU-CP sends PAGING message to the
gNB-DU. The MT-SDT indication may be included in the PAGING message.

4\. The gNB-DU sends the *Paging* message to the UE. In case the MT-SDT
indication is received in step 3, the gNB-DU includes the MT-SDT
indicator in the *Paging* message.

5\. If the UE has been successfully reached, it initiates the RRC
connection resume procedure as described in 8.6.2 or 8.9.6.2, or
initiates the SDT procedure as described from step 1 in 8.18.1 or from
step 9 in 8.18.2 or from step 1 in 8.18.3 with the following difference:

\- In case SDT procedure is initiated, the UE may indicate MT-SDT in the
RRCResumeRequest, which may be without UL data.

U2N Relay UE, the target gNB-DU and target gNB-CU, if the target U2N
Relay UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state. The target gNB-CU allocates the
local ID for the U2N Remote UE. The target gNB-CU sends an
*RRCReconfiguration* message to the target U2N Relay UE. If the target
U2N Relay UE is in RRC\_IDLE/INACTIVE state, this step is skipped and
the configuration to the target U2N Relay UE is performed in Step 15.

8.21 Overall procedures for Network Controlled Repeater
-------------------------------------------------------

### 8.21.1 Network Controlled Repeater Integration Procedure

A high-level flow chart for Network Controlled Repeater integration is
shown in Figure 8.21.1-1:

Figure 8.21.1-1: The integration procedure for Network Controlled
Repeater

Phase 1: NCR-MT setup. In this phase, the NCR-MT of the Network
Controlled Repeater (re-)selects a cell that broadcasts the Network
Controlled Repeater supporting information in SIB1. It then connects to
the network as a UE, by performing the RRC connection setup procedure
with the gNB-CU, and authentication with the 5GC. The NCR-MT includes
the Network Controlled Repeater indication in the *RRCSetupComplete*
message. The gNB selects an appropriate AMF for the Network Controlled
Repeater. Upon receiving the Network Controlled Repeater authorization
information from 5GC, the gNB-CU provides the authorization information
to the gNB-DU.

NOTE: The signalling flow for UE initial access procedure as shown in
Figure 8.1-1/Figure 8.9.1-1 is used for the setup of the NCR-MT.

Phase 2: Network Controlled Repeater configuration. The gNB-CU may
configure the Network Controlled Repeater via RRC.

Phase 3: Network Controlled Repeater Start Operation. After the Network
Controlled Repeater is configured, it may start serving the UE(s).

8.23 Mobile IAB migration procedures
------------------------------------

### 8.23.1 Migration of mobile IAB-MT via Xn handover

The mobile IAB-MT can be migrated from a source RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU to a target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU using the Xn
handover procedure. During this migration, the mobile IAB-DU co-located
with the mobile IAB-MT is connected to an F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU,
which may be the same as the source RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU or the
target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU, or it can be different from both
the source and the target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

Figure 8.23.1-1 shows an example of mobile IAB-MT migration via Xn
handover for the case when the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU is different
from the source RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU and the target
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU. In this example, the mobile IAB-MT is
connected to the source RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU via a source path
of an IAB topology before the migration, and it is connected to the
target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU via a target path of a different IAB
topology after the migration.

**Figure 8.23.1-1: Procedure for Xn-based migration of mobile IAB-MT**

1\. Steps 1-14 of the topology adaptation procedure in clause 8.17.3.1
are performed to conduct Xn handover of the mobile IAB-MT from the
source parent IAB-node connected to the source RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU to the target parent IAB-node connected to the target
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU. In these steps, the mobile IAB-node
corresponds to the migrating IAB-node in clause 8.17.3.1, and the mobile
IAB-MT's source and target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CUs correspond to
the respective source and target IAB-donor-CUs of clause8.17.3.1. The
source RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU should retain the UE XnAP IDs
allocated for the mobile IAB-MT as long as the mobile IAB-MT is
connected.

2\. Same as step 15 of the topology adaptation procedure in clause
8.17.3.1, where the F1-C connection between the co-located mobile IAB-DU
and its F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU is switched, by using the gNB-DU
Configuration Update procedure, to the target path using the new TNL
address information of the IAB-MT. In this step, the mobile IAB-node
corresponds to the migrating IAB-node, and the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU corresponds to the source IAB-donor-CU.

3\. The mobile IAB-DU passes to the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU the gNB
ID of the target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU and the mobile IAB-node's
BAP address allocated by the target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU via a
GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE message. In case the migration of the mobile
IAB-MT occurs during mobile IAB-DU migration, each logical mobile IAB-DU
passes this information to its respective F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.
The F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU retains the UE XnAP ID that it allocated
to the mobile IAB-MT as long as the co-located mobile IAB-DU connects to
this CU, and retains the UE XnAP ID allocated for the mobile IAB-MT by
the source RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU until the present step (step 3).

NOTE: Step 3 can be integrated into step 2, i.e., the two steps can use
a single execution of the gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure.

4\. Same as steps 16-20 of the topology adaptation procedure in clause
8.17.3.1, where the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU initiates the IAB
Transport Migration Management procedure towards the target
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU to provide the context of the offloaded
traffic. If the IAB Transport Migration Management procedure is the
first XnAP procedure for the mobile IAB-MT between the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU and the target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU, the
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU includes the mobile IAB-MT's BAP address in
the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT REQUEST message towards the
target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU. The target RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU reconfigures the BAP sublayer and/or BH RLC channels on the
target path accordingly, and provides the UL BH information for UL BH
reconfigurations to be conducted by the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU on
the mobile IAB-node. Then, the F1-U connections of the mobile IAB-node
are migrated to the target path.

NOTE In absence of Xn connectivity between the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU and the target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU, how to perform
the IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures and the
IAB Resource Coordination procedure is up to implementation.

### 8.23.2 Migration of mobile IAB-MT via NG handover

The mobile IAB-MT can be migrated from a source RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU to a target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU using the NG
handover procedure. During this migration, the mobile IAB-DU co-located
with the mobile IAB-MT is connected to an F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU,
which may be the same as the source RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU or the
target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU, or it can be different from both
the source and the target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

Figure 8.23.2-1 shows an example of mobile IAB-MT migration via NG
handover. In this example, the mobile IAB-MT is connected to the source
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU via a source path of an IAB topology before
the migration, and it is connected to the target RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU via a target path of a different IAB topology after the
migration.

Figure 8.23.2-1: Procedure for NG-based migration of mobile IAB-MT

1\. Similar to Step 1-14 in clause 8.17.3.1, where the NG-based handover
procedure as defined in clauses 4.9.1.3.2 and 4.9.1.3.3 in TS 23.502
\[32\] is used instead of Xn-based handover procedure.

2\. Same as step 2 to step 4 in clause 8.23.1.

NOTE In absence of Xn connectivity between the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU and the target RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU, how to perform
the IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures and the
IAB Resource Coordination procedure is up to implementation.

### 8.23.3 Mobile IAB-DU migration procedure

To support the mobile IAB-DU migration procedure, the mobile IAB-node
concurrently supports two logical mobile IAB-DUs, which have F1
connections set up with the source F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU and
target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, respectively. The mobile IAB-MT's
IAB-donor-CU may be same as either the source F1-termainting IAB-donor
CU or the target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, or it may be different
from both source and target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CUs.

The UE(s) connected to the mobile IAB-node are handed over from the
cell(s) of the source logical mobile IAB-DU that have F1 set up with the
source F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU to the cell(s) of the target logical
mobile IAB-DU that have F1 set up with the target F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU. After the UE(s) are handed over, the F1 connection between
the source logical mobile IAB-DU and the source F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU may be removed.

Figure 8.23.3-1 shows an example of the mobile IAB-DU migration
procedure. In this example, the source and the target F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CUs are different from the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU.

Figure 8.23.3-1: Mobile IAB-DU inter-CU migration procedure

1\. The source F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU may send an MIAB F1 SETUP
TRIGGERING message to the source logical mobile IAB-DU to initialize the
F1 Setup procedure towards the target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU. The
MIAB F1 SETUP TRIGGERING message includes the gNB ID of the target
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU and the information needed to establish the
TNL connection with the target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU for F1-C.

NOTE 0: The mobile IAB-DU migration can also be triggered by the OAM. In
this case, the OAM provides the mobile IAB-node with all information to
initiate the F1 Setup procedure towards the target F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU, in which case step 1 is omitted.

2\. The target logical mobile IAB-DU initiates TNL establishment and F1
setup (as defined in clause 8.5) with the target F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU. During the F1 Setup procedure, the target logical mobile
IAB-DU includes the gNB ID of the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU, and the
BAP address of the co-located mobile IAB-MT in the F1 SETUP REQUEST
message.

3\. The target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU responds to the target
logical mobile IAB-DU with an F1 SETUP RESPONSE message. After F1 setup
with the target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU, the target logical mobile
IAB-DU can serve UEs via the target mobile IAB-DU's activated cell(s).

4\. By sending the MIAB F1 SETUP OUTCOME NOTIFICATION message, the
source logical mobile IAB-DU informs the source F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU about the outcome of the F1 interface setup between the
co-located target logical mobile IAB-DU and the target F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU. The source logical mobile IAB-DU may provide the source
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU with a mapping between activated cells of
the source logical mobile IAB-DU and activated cells of the target
logical mobile IAB-DU. If the mobile IAB-DU migration is triggered by
the OAM, the gNB-ID of the target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU is
included in this message.

5\. The source F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU hands over the UE from a
source cell served by the source logical mobile IAB-DU to a target cell
served by the target logical mobile IAB-DU. The target F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU initiates the IAB Transport Migration Management procedure
towards the RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU for offloading the UE's traffic
during this step. In case the IAB Transport Migration Management
procedure is the first procedure for the mobile IAB-MT, it includes the
mobile IAB-MT's BAP address in the IAB TRANSPORT MIGRATION MANAGEMENT
REQUEST message. After the completion of the UE handover, the source
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU requests from the RRC-terminating
IAB-donor-CU the release of the UE's traffic offloaded to the
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU by initiating IAB Transport Migration
Management procedure.

NOTE 1: In step 5, the sequence of procedures for UE Handover and the
IAB Transport Migration Management procedure initiated by the target
F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU is up to implementation.

NOTE 2: It is up to RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU's implementation to set
up new backhaul resources or reuse the existing backhaul resources for
the UE's traffic.

NOTE 3: How to perform the IAB Transport Migration
Management/Modification procedures, and the IAB Resource Coordination
procedure between the target F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU and the
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU without Xn interface is up to
implementation.

NOTE 4: In presence of two logical DUs, it is up to implementation to
route DL traffic to the appropriate logical DU destination, e.g., based
on TNL information.

6\. After all the UEs are handed over, the source F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU may initiate the removal of the F1 interface towards the
source logical mobile IAB-DU.

### 8.23.4 Mobile IAB-node RLF recovery

When the mobile IAB-MT detects backhaul RLF, the mobile IAB-MT can
perform inter-CU backhaul RLF recovery procedure to another parent node
underneath a different IAB-donor-CU. The mobile IAB-DU and the
co-located mobile IAB-MT may connect to the same IAB-donor-CU before or
after the backhaul RLF recovery, or they may connect to different
IAB-donor-CUs before and after the backhaul RLF recovery. In case the
mobile IAB-MT and the mobile IAB-DU connect to the same IAB-donors
before the backhaul RLF recovery, the procedure is the same as defined
in steps 1-18 of the IAB inter-CU backhaul RLF recovery procedure
described in clause 8.17.4, where the mobile IAB-node corresponds to the
Recovery IAB-node.

In case the mobile IAB-MT and the mobile IAB-DU connect to different
IAB-donor-CUs before and after the backhaul RLF recovery, the procedure
for the backhaul RLF recovery is shown in Figure 8.23.4-1.

Figure 8.23.4- 1: Procedure for RLF recovery of mobile IAB-node

1\. Steps 1-17 of the backhaul RLF recovery procedure in clause 8.17.4
are performed to conduct backhaul RLF recovery of the mobile IAB-MT from
the initial parent IAB-node to the new parent IAB-node. In these steps,
the mobile IAB-node corresponds to the recovering IAB-node in clause
8.17.4. The initial and new RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CUs correspond to
the initial and new IAB-donor-CUs of clause 8.17.4, respectively.

2\. Step 14 of the topology adaptation procedure in clause 8.17.3.1 is
performed to configure BH resources on the new path for the mIAB-DU's
F1-C. In this step, the mobile IAB-node corresponds to the migrating
IAB-node, the new RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU corresponds to the target
IAB-donor-CU, and the new path of the mobile IAB-node corresponds to the
target path in clause 8.17.3.1.

3\. Step 15 of the topology adaptation procedure in clause 8.17.3.1 is
performed to redirect the mobile IAB-DU's F1-C to the new path, and
report the new F1-U TNL information to the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU.
In this step, the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU corresponds to the source
IAB-donor-CU in clause 8.17.3.1.

During this step, the mobile IAB-DU also passes the gNB ID of the new
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU and the mobile IAB-node's BAP address
allocated by the new RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU to the F1-terminating
IAB-donor-CU.

4\. Same as step 16-20 of the topology adaptation procedure in clause
8.17.3.1, where the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU initiates IAB Transport
Migration Management procedure to the new RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU
to provide the context of the offloaded traffic. The backhaul related
configurations along the new path can be re-configured by the new
RRC-terminating IAB-donor-CU, and the F1-U connections of the mobile
IAB-node are migrated to the new path.

8.24 Timing resiliency service
------------------------------

The following clauses describe the overall procedures for RAN Timing
Synchronisation Status (TSS) reporting involving gNB-CU/gNB-DU.

### 8.24.1 RAN TSS reporting towards the CN

The signaling flow for RAN TSS reporting towards the CN is shown in
Figure 8.24.1-1. This procedure is used when the TSCTSF subscribes to
RAN TSS reporting at the AMF as described in TS 23.502 \[32\].

Figure 8.24.1-1: RAN TSS reporting towards the CN

0\. The gNB-DU is pre-configured with a threshold for each RAN TSS
attribute it supports. The gNB-DU does not report RAN TSS attribute
values better than the pre-configured thresholds, i.e. if a RAN TSS
attribute has a value better than the pre-configured threshold, the
gNB-DU reports the threshold value to the gNB-CU instead.

NOTE 1: It is assumed the pre-configured thresholds in the gNB-DU are
sufficient to meet UE time sync performance requirement which are
configured by the operator.

1\. The AMF requests RAN TSS reporting by sending the TIMING
SYNCHRONISATION STATUS REQUEST message to the gNB-CU.

2\. The gNB-CU requests RAN TSS reporting from at least one gNB-DU by
sending the TIMING SYNCHRONISATION STATUS REQUEST message to the gNB-DU.

NOTE 2: It is up to gNB-CU implementation whether to send the request to
all its gNB-DUs or to a particular subset of its gNB-DUs, depending on
e.g. network topology.

3\. The gNB-DU replies to the gNB-CU by sending the TIMING
SYNCHRONISATION STATUS RESPONSE message.

4\. The gNB-CU replies to the AMF by sending the TIMING SYNCHRONISATION
STATUS RESPONSE message. If the gNB-CU does not receive a successful
response from at least one gNB-DU, the gNB-CU replies to the AMF by
sending the TIMING SYNCHRONISATION STATUS FAILURE message and the flow
stops at this step.

5\. Upon sending the response to the gNB-CU, the gNB-DU provides a first
RAN TSS report to the gNB-CU by sending the TIMING SYNCHRONISATION
STATUS REPORT message.

NOTE 3: The RAN TSS attributes included in the report is up to gNB-DU
implementation.

6\. The gNB-CU sends the TIMING SYNCHRONISATION STATUS REPORT message to
the AMF. The message contains the RAN TSS attributes received from the
gNB-DU and the *RAN TSS Scope* IE to indicate whether the scope of the
RAN TSS report is "RAN node level" or "cell list level".

7\. Later, the gNB-DU detects a primary source event:

a\) a RAN TSS attribute cannot meet a pre-configured threshold (i.e.
status is degraded);

b\) a RAN TSS attribute meets the pre-configured threshold again (i.e.
status is no longer degraded);

c\) event a) occurred and b) has not yet been reached for a RAN TSS
attribute, and either an implementation-dependent time interval has
passed or a previously reported value can no longer be met.

NOTE 4: Additional primary source events, if any, are up to gNB-DU
implementation.

8\. Upon detecting the primary source event, the gNB-DU provides an
updated RAN TSS report to the gNB-CU by sending a TIMING SYNCHRONISATION
STATUS REPORT message.

9\. Same as step 6.

### 8.24.2 RAN TSS reporting towards the UE

The signaling flow for RAN TSS reporting towards the UE in
RRC\_CONNECTED state is shown in Figure 8.24.2-1.

Figure 8.24.2-1: RAN TSS reporting towards the UE in RRC\_CONNECTED
state

NOTE 1: In this signalling flow, it is assumed that RAN TSS reporting is
already enabled at the gNB-DU.

1\. The AMF sends the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the
gNB-CU, containing the *Clock Quality Reporting Control Information* IE
within the *Time Synchronization Assistance Information* IE. The clock
quality reporting control information indicates the clock quality detail
level to provide to the UE, i.e. "metrics" or "acceptable/not acceptable
indication". If clock quality detail level equals "acceptable/not
acceptable indication", the clock quality reporting control information
also contains the clock quality acceptance criteria.

NOTE 2: The clock quality reporting control information can also be
provided in the UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST, HANDOVER REQUEST, or
PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE messages.

2\. The gNB-CU replies to the AMF by sending the INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP
RESPONSE message.

3\. The gNB-CU sends the latest clock quality information to the UE by
sending the *DLInformationTransfer* message. The clock quality
information provided to the UE depends on the clock quality detail level
received in step 1 (i.e., "metrics" or "acceptable/not acceptable
indication").

4\. Later, the gNB-DU detects a primary source event:

a\) a RAN TSS attribute cannot meet a pre-configured threshold (i.e.
status is degraded);

b\) a RAN TSS attribute meets the pre-configured threshold again (i.e.
status is no longer degraded);

c\) event a) occurred and b) has not yet been reached for a RAN TSS
attribute, and either an implementation-dependent time interval has
passed or a previously reported value can no longer be met.

NOTE 3: Additional primary source events, if any, are up to gNB-DU
implementation.

5\. Upon detecting the primary source event, the gNB-DU provides an
updated RAN TSS report to the gNB-CU by sending a TIMING SYNCHRONISATION
STATUS REPORT message.

6\. Same as step 3.

9 Synchronization
=================

9.1 gNB Synchronization
-----------------------

The gNB shall support a logical synchronization port for phase-, time-
and/or frequency synchronization.

Logical synchronization port for phase- and time-synchronization shall
provide:

1\) accuracy that allows to meet the gNB requirements on maximum
relative phase difference for all gNBs in synchronized TDD-unicast area;

2\) continuous time without leap seconds traceable to common time
reference for all gNBs in synchronized TDD-unicast area. In the case the
TDD-unicast area is not isolated, the common time reference shall be
traceable to the *Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).*

A logical synchronization port for phase- and time-synchronization may
also be provided for e.g., all gNBs in FDD time domain inter-cell
interference coordination synchronization area.

Furthermore common SFN initialization time shall be provided for all
gNBs in synchronized TDD-unicast area.

In case of non isolated networks, the start of the radio frame on the
output shall be synchronous with the input time reference, i.e., when an
UTC traceable reference is required, the start of the radio frame shall
be aligned with the start time of the *UTC* second.

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the operators of the cells in non
isolated networks and/or unless different SFN initialization offsettings
do not affect operators' networks in the same area, the common SFN
initialization time should be 1980-01-06T00:00:19 International Atomic
Time (TAI).

Based on this information, the gNB may derive the SFN according to the
following formula:

,

where:

time time adjusted by the common SFN initialization time, in units of
10 ms to match the length of radio frame and accuracy accordingly;

period(SFN) SFN period.

In case gNB is connected via TDM interface, it **may be used to
frequency synchronize the gNB.** The characteristics of the clock in the
gNB shall be designed taking into account that the jitter and wander
performance requirements on the interface are in accordance with network
limits for output wander at traffic interfaces of either ITU-T
Recommendation G.823 \[8\], ITU-T Recommendation G.824 \[9\] or network
limits for the maximum output jitter and wander at any hierarchical
interface of ITU-T Recommendation G.825 \[10\], whichever is applicable.

In case gNB is connected via Ethernet interface and the network supports
Synchronous Ethernet, the gNB may use this interface to get frequency
synchronization. In this case the design of the gNB clock should be done
considering the jitter and wander performance requirements on the
interface are as specified for output jitter and wander at EEC
interfaces of ITU-T Recommendation G.8261/Y.1361 \[11\], defined in
clause 9.2.1. Further considerations on Synchronous Ethernet
recommendations and architectural aspects are defined in clause 12.2.1
and Annex A of ITU-T Recommendation G.8261/Y.1361 \[11\].

A configurable LTE TDD-offset of start frame shall be supported by all
gNBs in synchronized TDD-unicast areas in order to achieve
interoperability in coexistence scenarios.

10 NG-RAN interfaces
====================

10.1 NG interface
-----------------

TS 38.410 \[14\] specifies NG interface general aspects and principles.

10.2 Xn interface
-----------------

TS 38.420 \[15\] specifies Xn interface general aspects and principles.

10.3 F1 interface
-----------------

TS 38.470 \[16\] specifies F1 interface general aspects and principles.

10.4 E1 interface
-----------------

TS 37.480 \[17\] specifies E1 interface general aspects and principles.

10.5 Antenna interface - general principles
-------------------------------------------

TS 37.460 \[35\] specifies Iuant interface general aspects and
principles.

The Iuant interface for the control of RET antennas or TMAs is a logical
part of the NG-RAN.

The support of any standardised antenna interface technique shall not be
prevented; e.g. AISG (Antenna interface standards group) specifications
may be used.

11 Overall procedures in NG-RAN Architecure
===========================================

11.1 Multiple TNLAs for Xn-C
----------------------------

In the following, the procedure for managing multiple TNLAs for Xn-C is
described.

Figure 11.1-1: Managing multiple TNLAs for Xn-C.

1\. The NG-RAN node~1~ establishes the first TNLA with the NG-RAN
node~2~ using a configured TNL address.

NOTE: The NG-RAN node~1~ may use different source and/or destination IP
end point(s) if the TNL establishment towards one IP end point fails.
How the NG-RAN node~1~ gets the remote IP end point(s) and its own IP
address are outside the scope of this specification.

2-3. Once the TNLA has been established, the NG-RAN node~1~ initiates
the Xn Setup procedure to exchange application level configuration data

4-6. The NG-RAN node~2~ may add additional TNL Endpoint(s) to be used
for Xn-C signalling between the NG-RAN node~1~ and the NG-RAN node~2~
pair using the NG-RAN node Configuration Update procedure. NG-RAN node
Configuration Update procedure also allows the NG-RAN node~2~ to request
the NG-RAN node~1~ to modify or release TNLA(s).

7-9. The NG-RAN node~1~ may add additional TNL Endpoint(s) to be used
for Xn-C signalling between the NG-RAN node~1~ and the NG-RAN node~2~
pair using the NG-RAN node Configuration Update procedure. NG-RAN node
Configuration Update procedure also allows the NG-RAN node~1~ to request
the NG-RAN node~2~ to modify or release TNLA(s).

The XnAP UE TNLA binding is a binding between a XnAP UE association and
a specific TNL association for a given UE. After the XnAP UE TNLA
binding is created, the NG-RAN node~1~ or the NG-RAN node~2~ can update
the UE TNLA binding by sending the first available XnAP message for the
UE to the peer NG-RAN node via a different TNLA. The peer NG-RAN node
shall update the XnAP UE TNLA binding with the new TNLA.

########  Annex A (informative): Deployment scenarios of gNB/en-gNB

Figure A-1 shows logical nodes (CU-C, CU-U and DU), internal to a
logical gNB/en-gNB. Protocol terminations of the NG and Xn interfaces
are depicted as ellipses in Figure A-1. The terms \"Central Entity\" and
\"Distributed Entity\" shown in Figure A-1 refer to physical network
nodes.

Figure A-1: Example deployment of an Logical gNB/en-gNB

########  Annex B: NG-RAN Architecture for Radio Access Network Sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast (informative)

Each gNB-DU serving a cell identified by a Cell Identity associated with
a subset of PLMNs is connected to a gNB-CU via a single F1-C interface
instance.

Each F1-C interface instance is setup individually.

F1-C interface instances terminating at gNB-DUs which share the same
physical radio resources may share the same F1-C signalling transport
resources. If this option is applied,

\- non-UE associated signalling is associated to an F1-C interface
instance by allocating the corresponding Transaction ID from a value
range associated to that F1-C interface instance.

\- node related, non-UE associated F1-C interface signalling may provide
information destined for multiple logical nodes in a single F1AP
procedure instance once the F1-C interface instance is setup.

NOTE 1: If the Transaction ID corresponds to more than one interface
instance, the respective F1AP message carries information destined for
multiple logical nodes.

\- a UE associated signalling connection is associated to an F1-C
interface instance by allocating values for the corresponding gNB-DU UE
F1AP ID and gNB-CU UE F1AP ID so that they can be mapped to that
interface instance.

NOTE 2: One possible implementation is to partition the value ranges of
the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID and gNB-CU UE F1AP ID and associate each value
range with an F1-C interface instance.

Interpreting the content of RRC MSG3 and other unciphered RRC message by
the gNB-DU is supported.

Content for System Information Broadcast is assumed to be coordinated
among the sharing PLMNs. PLMN specific SIB1 content is controlled by the
respective PLMN owner. Non PLMN specific content needs coordination to
avoid contradicting indication by PLMN specific gNB-CUs. For Warning
messages (SIB6, SIB7 and SIB8), if provided by more than one gNB-CU,
warning message duplicates are identified by provision of the Message
Number and the Serial Number by the gNB-CU and don't trigger new
broadcast or replace existing broadcast. Other coordination between
gNB-CUs is ensured by appropriate implementation.
