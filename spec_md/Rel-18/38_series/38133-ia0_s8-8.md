8.1 Radio Link Monitoring
-------------------------

### 8.1.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 8.1 apply for radio link monitoring on:

\- PCell in SA NR, NR-DC and NE-DC operation mode,

\- PCell operating with less than 5 MHz BW in SA NR (single carrier)
operation mode,

\- PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode,

\- Deactivated PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode, when
configured.

The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell, PSCell and deactivated PSCell
if configured with *bfd-and-RLM* with value *true* as specified in TS
38.331 \[2\]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all
CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. The configured RLM-RSs can be
from the same or different TRPs. UE is not required to perform RLM
outside the active DL BWP unless the UE supports
*bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, provided that the SSB is within
the configured UE-specific CBW. For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*,
the SSB and SMTC in this clause applies for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if
it is not additional specified. If SSB in the active DL BWP of serving
cell *i* is NCD-SSB, for serving cell *i* the requirements in clause 8.1
apply provided that serving cell *i* is PCell or activated PSCell.

On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio link
quality and compare it to the thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the
purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell.

When a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI
states and the UE is provided *sfnSchemePdcch* set to \'sfnSchemeA\' or
\'sfnSchemeB\', the UE shall estimate a single downlink radio link
quality to derive single SNR and compare it to the single thresholds
Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link
quality of the cell(s). How to compute the single SNR based on two
active TCI states is up to UE implementation.

The threshold Q~out~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the out-of-sync
block error rate (BLER~out~) as defined in table 8.1.1-1. For SSB based
radio link monitoring, Q~out\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.2.1-1. For CSI-RS
based radio link monitoring, Q~out\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.3.1-1.

The threshold Q~in~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link quality can be received with significantly higher reliability than
at Q~out~ and shall correspond to the in-sync block error rate
(BLER~in~) as defined in table 8.1.1-1. For SSB based radio link
monitoring, Q~in\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based
radio link monitoring, Q~in\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.3.1-2.

The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out~) and in-sync block error
rate (BLER~in~) are determined from the network configuration via
parameter *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* signalled by higher layers. When
UE is not configured with *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* from the
network, UE determines out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from
Configuration \#0 in table 8.1.1-1 by default. All requirements in
clause 8.1 are applicable for BLER Configuration \#0 in table 8.1.1-1.

  Configuration   BLER~out~   BLER~in~
  --------------- ----------- ----------
  0               10 %        2 %

UE shall be able to monitor up to N~RLM~ RLM-RS resources of the same or
different types in each corresponding carrier frequency range, depending
on a maximum number L~max~ of SSBs per half frame according to TS 38.213
\[3\], where N~RLM~ is specified in table 8.1.1-2 according TS 38.213
\[3\], and meet the requirements as specified in clause 8.1. UE is not
required to meet the requirements in clause 8.1 if RLM-RS is not
configured and no TCI state for PDCCH is activated.

#### 8.1.1.1 Introduction of Requirement on Radio Link Monitoring for UE Configured with Relaxed Measurement Criteria

For the UE supports *rlm-Relaxation-r17*and configured with explicit
signalling *goodServingCellEvaluationRLM*, which is always configured to
the UE when the network enables RLM relaxation for the UE as specified
in TS 38.331 \[2\], the relaxed requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.4
for SSB based radio link monitoring and the relaxed requirements defined
in clause 8.1.3.4 for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring are allowed to
apply to the relaxed RLM measurements on SpCell after fulfilling the
following conditions:

\- for the serving cells in intra-band carrier aggregation configured
with SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on SpCell together with CSI-RS based
BFD on SCell, when

> \- the good serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2
> of TS 38.331 \[2\] is fulfilled for the serving cell based on the
> measurements that are configured for SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on
> SpCell together with CSI-RS based BFD on SCell in the intra-band
> carrier aggregation if the *lowMobilityEvaluationConnected* is not
> configured, or
>
> \- the UE is also configured with *lowMobilityEvaluationConnected* and
> both low mobility criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.1 of TS 38.331
> \[2\] is fulfilled for a period of T~SearchDeltaP-Connected~ and good
> serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331
> \[2\] is fulfilled for the serving cell based on the measurements that
> are configured for SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on SpCell together
> with CSI-RS based BFD on SCell in the intra-band carrier aggregation.

\- for other serving cells, when

\- the good serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of
TS 38.331 \[2\] is fulfilled for the SpCell if the
*lowMobilityEvaluationConnected* is not configured, or

\- the UE is also configured with *lowMobilityEvaluationConnected* and
both low mobility criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.1 of TS 38.331
\[2\] is fulfilled for a period of T~SearchDeltaP-Connected~ and good
serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331
\[2\] is fulfilled for the SpCell.

Otherwise, UE shall apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.2 for
SSB based radio link monitoring and the requirements defined in clause
8.1.3.2 for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring. Note that when multiple
resources are configured on a serving cell for RLM or BFD evaluation,
the good serving cell quality critierion is considered as fulfilled for
the serving cell when any resource configured for the cell fulfills the
good serving defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331 \[2\].

The UE is no longer allowed to relax RLM measurements and apply the
relaxed radio link monitoring provided that at least one of the
following conditions is met:

\- The UE sends out-of sync indications to the higher layers,

\- The timer T310 is running.

\- No DRX is configured or configured DRX cycle is longer than 80 ms

NOTE: Applicability of DRX configuration follows TS 38.331 \[2\] clause
5.7.13.0.

### 8.1.2 Requirements for SSB based radio link monitoring

#### 8.1.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB based RLM-RS resource
configured for PCell, PSCell or deactivated PSCell, provided that the
SSB configured for RLM is actually transmitted within UE active DL BWP
during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.1.2.2 unless
the UE supports *bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*, provided that
the SSB is within the configured UE-specific CBW.

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps or
periodic MUSIM gap(s) or NCSGs and per-FR measurement gaps or NCSGs,
and, in case of Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR
measurement gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and starting at
the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions, MUSIM gap
occasions or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** RLM-RS**.**

**-** xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP

Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* nor *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* nor
supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* or when neither of the above
configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement gaps, concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s), concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s), and periodic MUSIM gaps,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, and these GAPs are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with
any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS resource
is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~)
and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \<
xRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the RLM-RS resource outside GAP is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present, T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows
*smtc1.* T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the
same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same
offset.

\- When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,

\- an RLM-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if it overlaps a GAP occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG is configured,

\- an RLM-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

> \- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG only, an RLM-RS resource or an
> SMTC occasion is only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the
> Pre-MG is activated.

\- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s)
or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, an RLM-RS
resource or an SMTC occasion is not considered as overlapped by a GAP
occasion if the GAP occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8,
clause 9.1.12, clause 9.1.13, respectively.

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with RLM-RS
resource occasion, longer evaluation period would be expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and if RLM-RS resource
occasions are fully overlapped with MUSIM gap(s) or the union of MUSIM
gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies for SSB based RLM.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 8.1.2.3 Measurement restrictions for SSB based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB OFDM symbols used for RLM fully or partially
overlap with CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for RLM without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements
are defined

For FR2, when the SSB for RLM measurementÂ on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based
RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for RLM measurementÂ on one CC is in the same or
adjacent OFDM symbol as SSB from cell with additional PCI for BFD, CBD
or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,
UE is required to measure one of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement
period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for RLM measurementÂ on one CC fully or partially
overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell
for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period for SSB based RLM is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, there is no measurement restriction allowed when the network
configures mixed numerology between SSB for RLM measurement on one FR2
band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the
other FR2 band, provided that UE is capable of independent beam
management on this FR2 band pair.

#### 8.1.2.4 Minimum requirement of SSB based radio link monitoring for UE fulfilling relaxed measurement criteria

This clause contains minimum requirements for relaxed radio link
monitoring based on SSB.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB\_Relax~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB\_Relax~ evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB\_Relax~ is defined in table 8.1.2.4-1 for FR1.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB\_Relax~ is defined in table 8.1.2.4-2 for FR2 with
scaling factor N=8.

The value of P is defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

### 8.1.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring

#### 8.1.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS based RLM-RS
resource configured for PCell, PSCell or deactivated PSCell, provided
that the CSI-RS configured for RLM is actually transmitted within UE
active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.1.3.2. UE is not expected to perform radio link monitoring
measurements on the CSI-RS configured as RLM-RS if the CSI-RS is not in
the active TCI state of any CORESET configured in the UE active BWP.

#### 8.1.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ evaluation period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ ms period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ ms evaluation period.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
table 8.1.3.2-1 for FR1.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
table 8.1.3.2-2 for FR2 with scaling factor N=1.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
table 8.1.3.2-3 for FR1 (deactivated PSCell).

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
table 8.1.3.2-4 for FR2 (deactivated PSCell) with scaling factor N=1.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~
apply provided that the CSI-RS for RLM is not in a resource set
configured with repetition ON. The requirements do not apply when the
CSI-RS resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS
resource for RLM and the TCI state information of the CSI-RS resource is
not given, wherein the TCI state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for
L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and when concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or
*musim-GapPreference-r17* or both *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and
*musim-GapPreference-r17,* and when concurrent measurement gaps or
periodic MUSIM gaps or both concurrent GAPs and periodic MUSIM gaps are
are configured,

\- an RLM-RS resource occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a
gap occasion if the gap occasion is dropped according to clauses 9.1.8
and 9.1.10,

\- P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with Navailable \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps or
periodic MUSIM gap(s) or NCSGs and per-FR measurement gaps or NCSGs,
and, in case of Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR
measurement gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and starting at
the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions, MUSIM gap
occasions or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any non-dropped **GAP** occasion nor non-dropped
MUSIM gap occasion within the window W, and

\- N~available~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any non-dropped **GAP** occasion, nor non-dropped MUSIM
gap occasion, nor any SMTC occasion within the window W, and

\- an RLM-RS resource occasion is considered to be overlapped with the
MUSIM gap if it overlaps a MUSIM gap occasion, and

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS.

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.

Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* nor *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* nor
supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* or when neither of the above
configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement gaps, concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s), concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s), and periodic MUSIM gaps,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, and these GAPs\] are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P=1, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap
and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS resource is not
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< xRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS resource
is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped
with GAP and RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  xRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{Min(xRP,\ T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
GAP

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with GAP
(T~SMTCperiod~ \< xRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the RLM-RS resource outside GAP is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present, T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows
*smtc1.* T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the
same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same
offset.

\- When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,

\- an RLM-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if it overlaps a GAP occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG is configured,

\- an RLM-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

If the UE is configured with Pre-MG only, an RLM-RS resource or an SMTC
occasion is only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG
is activated.

When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) or
concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured , an RLM-RS
resource or an SMTC occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a GAP
occasion if the GAP occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8,
clause 9.1.12, clause 9.1.13, respectively.

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for RLM and SMTC means that CSI-RS
based RLM is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with RLM-RS
resource occasion, longer evaluation period would be expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and if RLM-RS resource
occasions are fully overlapped with MUSIM gap(s) or the union of MUSIM
gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies for CSI-RS based RLM.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 8.1.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS based RLM

The SSB mentioned in this clause can be associated with either the
serving cell PCI or a PCI different from serving cell PCI.

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol
as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for RLM in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, or L1-RSRP measurement has same
SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS
measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement has
different SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall be able to perform
CSI-RS measurement with restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS for RLM measurement without
restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM and SSB.
Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as another
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be able to
measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurementÂ on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for RLM and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM
is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbour cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for RLM measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement fully or partially overlaps
with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell for
intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap, if CSI-RS and SSB have different SCS and UE
does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM measurement and SSB. Longer
measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement on one CC fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbour cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM measurement and
SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurementÂ on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for RLM and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for RLM or the other CSI-RS in a resource set configured
with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any
restriction.

For FR2-1, there is no measurement restriction allowed for UE supporting
*schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18*, according to the conditions
described in clause 3.6.19, and the UE is required to measure both the
CSI-RS for RLM and the other CSI-RS for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement,
while meeting requirements in clause 8.1.3.2, provided the following
conditions are met:

\- Both CSI-RSs are not in any CSI-RS resource set with repetition ON,
and

\- One CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- the other CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- Resources of the active TCI states of the two PDSCHs, or QCL sources
of the default QCL assumption, or the active TCI state of PDSCH and QCL
source of the default QCL assumption have been reported as a resource
group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

#### 8.1.3.4 Minimum requirement of CSI-RS based radio link monitoring for UE fulfilling relaxed measurement criteria

This clause contains minimum requirements for relaxed radio link
monitoring based on CSI-RS.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ is defined in table 8.1.3.4-1 for FR1.

T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ is defined in table 8.1.3.4-2 for FR2
with scaling factor N=1.

The value of P is defined in clause 8.1.3.2.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The values of M~out~ used in table 8.1.3.4-1 and table 8.1.3.4-2 are
defined as:

\- M~out~ = 20, if the CSI-RS resource configured for RLM is transmitted
with higher layer CSI-RS parameter *density* \[6, clause 7.4.1\] set to
3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

### 8.1.4 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the UE transitions between DRX and no DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, for each RLM-RS resource, for a duration of time
equal to the evaluation period corresponding toÂ the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first
mode and the second mode. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use
an evaluation period corresponding to the second mode for each RLM-RS
resource. This requirement shall be applied to both out-of-sync
evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the monitored cell.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of RLM resources to a
second configuration of RLM resources that is different from the first
configuration, for each RLM resource present in the second
configuration, for a duration of time equal to the evaluation period
corresponding to the second configuration after the transition occurs,
the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no less than the minimum
of evaluation periods corresponding to the first configuration and the
second configuration. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second configuration for each RLM
resource present in the second configuration. This requirement shall be
applied to both out-of-sync evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the
monitored cell.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of active TCI state
of the CORESET to a second configuration of active TCI state of the
CORESET, for each CSI-RS for RLM present in the second configuration,
the UE shall use an evaluation period corresponding to the second
configuration from the time of transition. This requirement shall be
applied to both out-of-sync evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the
monitored cell.

For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, when the UE transitions between
RLM CD-SSB resource and RLM NCD-SSB resource due to BWP switching or due
to SCG activation or deactivation during one evaluation period, the UE
shall use an evaluation period that is the maximum of the evaluation
periods corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type
after the BWP switching or the SCG activation or deactivation.
Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an evaluation period
corresponding to the second SSB type for each RLM-RS resource.

### 8.1.5 Minimum requirement for UE turning off the transmitter

The transmitter power of the UE in the monitored cell shall be turned
off within 40 ms after expiry of T310 timer as specified in TS 38.331
\[2\].

### 8.1.6 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication

When the downlink radio link quality on all the configured RLM-RS
resources is worse than Q~out~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
out-of-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the out-of-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

When the downlink radio link quality on at least one of the configured
RLM-RS resources is better than Q~in~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
in-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3 filter
shall be applied to the in-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

The out-of-sync and in-sync evaluations for the configured RLM-RS
resources shall be performed as specified in clause 5 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval~.

When DRX is not used T~Indication\_interval~ is max(10 ms, T~RLM-RS,M~),
where T~RLM-RS,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all configured RLM-RS
resources for the monitored cell, which corresponds to T~SSB~ specified
in clause 8.1.2 if the RLM-RS resource is SSB, or T~CSI-RS~ specified in
clause 8.1.3 if the RLM-RS resource is CSI-RS.

In case DRX is used, T~Indication\_interval~ is Max(10ms, 1.5 Ã—
DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 Ã— T~RLM-RS,M~)) if DRX\_cycle\_length is less
than or equal to 320ms, and T~Indication\_interval~ is
DRX\_cycle\_length if DRX\_cycle\_length is greater than 320ms. Upon
start of T310 timer as specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\], the UE shall
monitor the configured RLM-RS resources for recovery using the
evaluation period and layer 1 indication interval corresponding to the
no DRX mode until the expiry or stop of T310 timer.

For deactivated PSCell, when DRX is not used T~Indication\_interval~ is
Max (10ms, *measCyclePSCell*). In case DRX is used,
T~Indication\_interval~ is Max(10ms, 1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 Ã—
*measCyclePSCell*)) if DRX\_cycle\_length is less than or equal to
320ms, and T~Indication\_interval~ is Max (DRX\_cycle\_length,
*measCyclePSCell*) if DRX\_cycle\_length is greater than 320ms.

### 8.1.7 Scheduling availability of UE during radio link monitoring

When the reference signal to be measured for RLM has different
subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH or is in FR2, there are restrictions
on the scheduling availability as described in the following clauses.

#### 8.1.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
performed with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1.

#### 8.1.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to radio link
monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to radio link monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols
> to be measured for radio link monitoring.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell applies to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the
restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18*, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured on the
non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided. Otherwise, the
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell applies to all
serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially
overlap with the restricted symbols if *nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18* is
provided.

When inter-band FR1-FR1 NR-DC is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) in the bands due to radio link
monitoring performed on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell in different bands.

#### 8.1.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to radio link
monitoring on an FR2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

\- If the RLM-RS is CSI-RS which is type-D QCLed with active TCI state
for PDCCH or PDSCH, and the CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS resource set with
repetition ON,

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
based on the CSI-RS.

\- For FR2-1, for UE supporting *schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18*,,
according to the conditions described in clause 3.6.19, and is
configured to receive two PDSCH transmission occasions from two
different QCL sources on PCell, there are no scheduling restrictions for
the PDSCHs due to radio link monitoring based on the CSI-RS, when
following conditions are met:

\- The CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS resource set with repetition ON,

\- The CSI-RS has same QCL source as the active TCI state of one of the
PDSCHs and has different QCL-TypeD from the other PDSCH,

\- The CSI-RS and both of the PDSCHs are on the same OFDM symbol(s),

\- The CSI-RS and both of the PDSCHs are on the same OFDM symbol(s), or
the CSI-RS and one of the PDSCHs with different QCL typeD are on the
same OFDM symbol(s) when partially overlapping PDSCHs are scheduled,

\- Resources of the active TCI states for the two PDSCHs have been
reported as a resource group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

\- Otherwise

\- For FR2-1 or the RLM-RS is not using 480 kHz SCS or 960 kHz SCS on
FR2-2, the UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on RLM-RS symbols
to be measured for radio link monitoring.

\- For FR2-2 and the RLM-RS is using 480 kHz SCS or 960 kHz SCS, the UE
is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive PDCCH, PDSCH
or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on RLM-RS symbols to be
measured for radio link monitoring, and on one data symbol before each
RLM-RS symbol to be measured and one data symbol after each RLM-RS
symbol to be measured.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on FR2 serving PCell or PSCell applies to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with
restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) in the bands for the
following cases, provided that UE is capable of independent beam
management on this FR2 band pair:

\- when performing radio link monitoring performed on FR2 serving PCell
or PSCell in different bands,

\- the UE is configured with same or different numerology between SSB on
one FR2 band and data on the other FR2 band.

For FR2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 3, UE shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be
measured for RLM; and

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 2, UE shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for
RLM.

#### 8.1.7.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA and NR-DC

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to radio
link monitoring performed on FR2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to radio
link monitoring performed on FR1 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

### 8.1.8 Minimum requirement under IDC Interference

When the UE is provided with IDC solution, the UE shall also perform
radio link monitoring and meet the corresponding requirements in
clauseÂ 8.1.

8.1A Radio Link Monitoring with CCA on Target Frequency
-------------------------------------------------------

### 8.1A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 8.1A apply for radio link monitoring on a
carrier frequency with CCA for cells:

\- PCell in SA NR operation mode,

\- PSCell in EN-DC operation mode.

\- PSCell in NR-DC operation mode.

The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell and PSCell as specified in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all
CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required to perform RLM
outside the active DL BWP.

On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio link
quality and compare it to the thresholds Q~out,CCA~ and Q~in,CCA~ for
the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell.

The threshold Q~out,CCA~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the
out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out,CCA~) as defined in table
8.1A.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring, Q~out\_SSB,CCA~ is
derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed
in table 8.1A.2.1-1.

The threshold Q~in,CCA~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio link quality can be received with significantly higher reliability
than at Q~out,CCA~ and shall correspond to the in-sync block error rate
(BLER~in~) as defined in table 8.1A.1-1. For SSB based radio link
monitoring, Q~in\_SSB,CCA~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in table 8.1A.2.1-2.

The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out,CCA~) and in-sync block error
rate (BLER~in,CCA~) are determined from the network configuration via
parameter *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* signalled by higher layers. When
UE is not configured with *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* from the
network, UE determines out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from
Configuration \#0 in table 8.1A.1-1 as default. All requirements in
clause 8.1A are applicable for BLER Configuration \#0 in table 8.1A.1-1.

Table 8.1A.1-1: Out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates

  Configuration   BLER~out,CCA~   BLER~in,CCA~
  --------------- --------------- --------------
  0               10 %            2 %

UE shall be able to monitor up to N~RLM~ RLM-RS resources of the same or
different types in each corresponding carrier frequency range, depending
on a maximum number L~max~ of SSBs per half frame according to TS 38.213
\[3\], where N~RLM~ is specified in table 8.1A.1-2, and meet the
requirements as specified in clause 8.1A. UE is not required to meet the
requirements in clause 8.1A if RLM-RS is not configured and no TCI state
for PDCCH is activated.

Table 8.1A.1-2: Maximum number of RLM-RS resources N~RLM~

  Carrier frequency range of PCell/PSCell   L~max~   Maximum number of RLM-RS resources, N~RLM~

  FR1                                       8        4
  FR2-2                                     64       8

In the requirements of clause 8.1A, the term RLM-RS SSB occasion not
available at the UE refers to when the RLM-RS SSB is configured by gNB
in a cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but the first two
successive candidate SSB positions for the same SSB index within the set
of configured RLM-RS resources are not available at the UE due to DL CCA
failures at gNB during the corresponding evaluation period; otherwise
the RLM-RS SSB is considered as available at the UE.

The requirements in clause 8.1A apply for any *channelAccessMode*
configuration \[2\].

### 8.1A.2 Requirements for SSB Based Radio Link Monitoring

#### 8.1A.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB based RLM-RS resource
configured for PCell or PSCell, provided that the SSB configured for RLM
are actually configured to be transmitted within UE active DL BWP during
the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.1A.2.2 but
occasionally may not be transmitted due to CCA operation.

the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB,CCA~ period becomes better than the threshold

NCSGs and per-FR **measurement gap** or NCSGs, and, in case of Pre-MG,
all activated per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement gaps,
within the same FR as serving cell, and starting at the beginning of any
RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions within the
window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **GAP** occasion within the window W

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.

Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* nor *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* or when
neither of the above configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement
gaps, concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) and concurrent
measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s),

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, and these GAPs are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB RLM-RS resources;
and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the SSB RLM-RS resources.

When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,

\- an RLM-RS resource is considered to be overlapped with the GAP f it
overlaps a GAP occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

Otherwise, when NCSG only is configured,

\- an RLM-RS resource is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it
overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, and

\- xRP = VIRP

If the UE is configured with Pre-MG only, an RLM-RS resource is only
considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) or
concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, an RLM-RS
resource is not considered to be overlapped by a GAP occasion if the GAP
occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8, clause 9.1.12, clause
9.1.13, respectively.

For FR2-2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS resource
is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped
with GAP and RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS is
partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and
SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and
T~SSB~ = 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
GAP

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the RLM-RS
resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~)
and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \<
MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the RLM-RS resource outside GAP is

-   not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
    K data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
    *SSB-ToMeasure* and K data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
    indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is
    configured, where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of
    *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all the configured measurement objects merged
    on the same serving carrier, and K is defined in clause 9.2.5.3.3,
    and,

-   not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by
    *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and K data symbol before each RSSI symbol
    indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and K data symbol after each RSSI
    symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
    *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured, and K is defined in clause
    9.2.5.3.3.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*
T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the same
FR2-2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2-2 have the same
offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

8.1A.2.3 Measurement Restrictions for SSB based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for
RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for RLM without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure SSB for RLM.

For FR2-2, when the SSB for RLM measurementÂ on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.1A.3 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the UE transitions between DRX and no DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, for each RLM-RS resource, for a duration of time
equal to the evaluation period corresponding toÂ the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first
mode and the second mode. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use
an evaluation period corresponding to the second mode for each RLM-RS
resource. This requirement shall be applied to both out-of-sync
evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the monitored cell.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of RLM resources to a
second configuration of RLM resources that is different from the first
configuration, for each RLM resource present in the second
configuration, for a duration of time equal to the evaluation period
corresponding to the second configuration after the transition occurs,
the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no less than the minimum
of evaluation periods corresponding to the first configuration and the
second configuration. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second configuration for each RLM
resource present in the second configuration. This requirement shall be
applied to both out-of-sync evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the
monitored cell.

### 8.1A.4 Minimum requirement for UE turning off the transmitter

The transmitter power of the UE in the monitored cell shall be turned
off within 40 ms after expiry of T310 timer as specified in TS 38.331
\[2\]. The UE shall not perform CCA procedure on any of the serving
carrier frequencies with CCA after the expiry of T310.

### 8.1A.5 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication

When the downlink radio link quality on all the configured RLM-RS
resources is worse than Q~out,CCA~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
out-of-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the out-of-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

When the downlink radio link quality on at least one of the configured
RLM-RS resources is better than Q~in,CCA~, layer 1 of the UE shall send
an in-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the in-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

The out-of-sync and in-sync evaluations for the configured RLM-RS
resources shall be performed as specified in clause 5 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval,CCA~.

When DRX is not used T~Indication\_interval,CCA~ is max(10 ms,
T~RLM-RS,M~), where T~RLM,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all
configured RLM-RS resources for the monitored cell, which corresponds to
T~SSB~ specified in clause 8.1A.2 if the RLM-RS resource is SSB.

In case DRX is used, T~Indication\_interval,CCA~ is Max(10ms, 1.5 Ã—
DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 Ã— T~RLM-RS,M~)) if DRX\_cycle\_length is less
than or equal to 320ms, and T~Indication\_interval,CCA~ is
DRX\_cycle\_length if DRX\_cycle\_length is greater than 320ms. Upon
start of T310 timer as specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\], the UE shall
monitor the configured RLM-RS resources for recovery using the
evaluation period and layer 1 indication interval corresponding to the
no DRX mode until the expiry or stop of T310 timer.

### 8.1A.6 Scheduling availability of UE during radio link monitoring

When the reference signal to be measured for RLM on a carrier frequency
with CCA has different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH, there are
restrictions on the scheduling availability as described in the
following clauses.

8.1A.6.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring
with the same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
performed with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1.

8.1A.6.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring
with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to radio link
monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to radio link monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to
be measured for radio link monitoring.

When intra-band carrier aggregation is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on PCell or PSCell applies to all serving cells in the same
band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the restricted
symbols.

#### 8.1A.6.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring on FR2-2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to radio link
monitoring on an FR2-2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

\- If the RLM-RS is CSI-RS which is type-D QCLed with active TCI state
for PDCCH or PDSCH, and the CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS resource set with
repetition ON,

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
based on the CSI-RS.

\- Otherwise

\- When the RLM-RS is using 120 kHz SCS, the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for
tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on RLM-RS symbols to be measured for radio
link monitoring.

\- When the RLM-RS is using 480 kHz SCS or 960 kHz SCS, the UE is not
expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive PDCCH, PDSCH or
CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on RLM-RS resource symbols to be
measured for radio link monitoring, and on one data symbol before each
RLM-RS symbol to be measured and one data symbol after each RLM-RS
symbol to be measured.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2-2 is performed, the
scheduling restrictions on FR2-2 serving PCell or PSCell applies to all
serving cells in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially
overlap with restricted symbols.

For FR2-2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 3, UE shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be
measured for RLM; and

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 2, UE shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for
RLM.

#### 8.1A.6.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring on FR1 or FR2-2 in case of FR1-FR2-2 inter-band CA and NR-DC

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to radio
link monitoring performed on FR2-2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2-2 serving cell(s) due to
radio link monitoring performed on FR1 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

8.1B Radio Link Monitoring for RedCap
-------------------------------------

### 8.1B.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 8.1B apply for radio link monitoring on UE
with reduced capabilities:

\- PCell in SA NR operation mode,

The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell as specified in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all
CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required to perform RLM
outside the active DL BWP. The SSB and SMTC in this clause applies for
both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if it is not additional specified.

On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio link
quality and compare it to the thresholds Q~out,RedCap~ and Q~in,RedCap~
for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell.

The threshold Q~out,RedCap~ is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to
the out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out~) as defined in table
8.1B.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring, Q~out\_SSB,RedCap~ is
derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed
in table 8.1B.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based radio link monitoring,
Q~out\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in table 8.1B.3.1-1.

The threshold Q~in,RedCap~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio link quality can be received with significantly higher reliability
than at Q~out,RedCap~ and shall correspond to the in-sync block error
rate (BLER~in,RedCap~) as defined in table 8.1B.1-1. For SSB based radio
link monitoring, Q~in\_SSB,RedCap~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1B.2.1-2. For CSI-RS
based radio link monitoring, Q~in\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ is derived based on
the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table
8.1B.3.1-2.

The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out,RedCap~) and in-sync block
error rate (BLER~in,RedCap~) are determined from the network
configuration via parameter *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* signalled by
higher layers. When UE is not configured with
*rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* from the network, UE determines
out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from Configuration \#0 in
table 8.1B.1-1 by default. All requirements in clause 8.1B are
applicable for BLER Configuration \#0 in table 8.1B.1-1.

#### 8.1B.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB,RedCap~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_SSB,RedCap~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB,RedCap~ evaluation
period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB,RedCap~ period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_SSB,RedCap~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB,RedCap~ evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB,RedCap~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB,RedCap~ are defined
in table 8.1B.2.2-1 and table 8.1B.2.2-3 for FR1 for UE with 2Rx RedCap
and 1Rx RedCap, respectively.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB,RedCap~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB,RedCap~ are defined
in table 8.1B.2.2-2 and for FR2 with scaling factor N=8 for 2Rx RedCap.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, and these
measurement gaps are overlapping with some but not all occasions of the
SSB; and

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC
period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and the
RLM-RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with measurement gap
and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully
overlapped with measurement gap

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MRGP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the RLM-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

-   not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
    1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
    *SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
    indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is
    configured, where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of
    *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all the configured measurement objects merged
    on the same serving carrier, and,

-   not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by
    *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
    indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
    symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
    *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 8.1B.2.3 Measurement restrictions for SSB based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for
RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for RLM without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for RLM measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is required to
measure one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.1B.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring

#### 8.1B.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS based RLM-RS
resource configured for PCell, provided that the CSI-RS configured for
RLM is actually transmitted within UE active DL BWP during the entire
evaluation period specified in clause 8.1B.3.2. UE is not expected to
perform radio link monitoring measurements on the CSI-RS configured as
RLM-RS if the CSI-RS is not in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP.

#### 8.1B.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ evaluation
period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ evaluation
period.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS,RedCap~
are defined in table 8.1B.3.2-1 and table 8.1B.3.2-3 for FR1 for RedCap
2Rx RedCap and 1Rx RedCap, respectively.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS,RedCap~
are defined in table 8.1B.3.2-2 for FR2 with scaling factor N=1 for 2 Rx
RedCap.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ and
T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS,RedCap~ apply provided that the CSI-RS for RLM is
not in a resource set configured with repetition ON. The requirements do
not apply when the CSI-RS resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is
the same CSI-RS resource for RLM and the TCI state information of the
CSI-RS resource is not given, wherein the TCI state information means
QCL Type-D to SSB for L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, and these
measurement gaps are overlapping with some but not all occasions of the
CSI-RS; and

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P=1, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap
and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when the RLM-RS
resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap and the RLM-RS
resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5 Ã—
T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap and the
RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully overlapped with
measurement gap

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped
with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the RLM-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

> where,
>
> If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
> present, T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~
> follows *smtc1.*

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for RLM and SMTC means that CSI-RS
based RLM is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The values of M~out,RedCap~ and M~in,RedCap~ used in table 8.1B.3.2-1
and table 8.1B.3.2-2 for UE with 2Rx are defined as:

\- M~out,RedCap~ = 20 and M~in,RedCap~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource
configured for RLM is transmitted with higher layer CSI-RS parameter
*density* \[6, clause 7.4.1\] set to 3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

The values of M~out,RedCap~ and M~in,RedCap~ used in table 8.1B.3.2-3
for RedCap UE with 1Rx are defined as:

\- M~out,RedCap~ = 40 and M~in,RedCap~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource
configured for RLM is transmitted with higher layer CSI-RS parameter
*density* \[6, clause 7.4.1\] set to 3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

#### 8.1B.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol
as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for RLM in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, or L1-RSRP measurement is
within the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions according to its
capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS for RLM measurement without
restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM and SSB.
Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as another
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be able to
measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as SSB for
RLM, BFD, or L1-RSRP measurement, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
when beam failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not
both CSI-RS for RLM and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based
RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for RLM and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for RLM or the other CSI-RS in a resource set configured
with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any
restriction.

### 8.1B.4 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the UE transitions between RLM CD-SSB resource and RLM NCD-SSB
resource due to BWP switching during one evaluation period, the UE shall
use an evaluation period that is the maximum of the evaluation periods
corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after the
BWP switching. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second SSB type for each RLM-RS
resource.

The requirements in clause 8.1.4 shall also apply except the scenarios
described above.

### 8.1B.5 Minimum requirement for UE turning off the transmitter

The requirements in clause 8.1.5 shall apply.

### 8.1B.6 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication

When the downlink radio link quality on all the configured RLM-RS
resources is worse than Q~out,RedCap~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
out-of-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the out-of-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

When the downlink radio link quality on at least one of the configured
RLM-RS resources is better than Q~in,RedCap~, layer 1 of the UE shall
send an in-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the in-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

The out-of-sync and in-sync evaluations for the configured RLM-RS
resources shall be performed as specified in clause 5 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval,RedCap~.

When DRX is not used for RedCap UEs, T~Indication\_interval,RedCap~ is
max(10 ms, T~RLM-RS,M~), where T~RLM,M~ is the shortest periodicity of
all configured RLM-RS resources for the monitored cell, which
corresponds to T~SSB~ specified in clause 8.1B.2 if the RLM-RS resource
is SSB, or T~CSI-RS~ specified in clause 8.1B.3 if the RLM-RS resource
is CSI-RS.

In case DRX is used for RedCap UEs, T~Indication\_interval,RedCap~ is
Max(10ms, 1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 Ã— T~RLM-RS,M~)) if
DRX\_cycle\_length is less than or equal to 320ms, and
T~Indication\_interval~ is DRX\_cycle\_length if DRX\_cycle\_length is
greater than 320ms. Upon start of T310 timer as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\], the UE shall monitor the configured RLM-RS resources
for recovery using the evaluation period and layer 1 indication interval
corresponding to the no DRX mode until the expiry or stop of T310 timer.

When DRX is not used for HD-FDD RedCap UEs,
T~Indication\_interval,RedCap~ is max(10 ms, T~RLM-RS,M~), where
T~RLM,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all configured RLM-RS resources
for the monitored cell, which corresponds to T~SSB~ specified in clause
8.1B.2 if the RLM-RS resource is SSB, or T~CSI-RS~ specified in clause
8.1B.3 if the RLM-RS resource is CSI-RS, under the following condition

\- For each RLM-RS configuration, at least one RLM-RS sample must fall
with DL occasion within an indication period.

In case DRX is used for HD-FDD RedCap UEs,
T~Indication\_interval,RedCap~ is Max(10ms, 1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length,
1.5 Ã— T~RLM-RS,M~)) if DRX\_cycle\_length is less than or equal to
320ms, and T~Indication\_interval~ is DRX\_cycle\_length if
DRX\_cycle\_length is greater than 320ms, under the following condition

\- For each RLM-RS configuration, at least one RLM-RS sample must fall
with DL occasion within an indication period.

### 8.1B.7 Scheduling availability of UE during radio link monitoring

The requirements in clause 8.1.7 shall apply.

#### 8.1B.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

The requirements in clause 8.1.7.1 shall apply.

#### 8.1B.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to radio link
monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to radio link monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to
be measured for radio link monitoring.

#### 8.1B.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to radio link
monitoring on an FR2 serving PCell.

> \- If the RLM-RS is CSI-RS which is type-D QCLed with active TCI state
> for PDCCH or PDSCH, and the CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS resource set
> with repetition ON,
>
> \- There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
> based on the CSI-RS.
>
> \- Otherwise
>
> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on RLM-RS
> symbols to be measured for radio link monitoring.

For FR2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 3, UE shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be
measured for RLM; and

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 2, UE shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE
monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for
RLM.

8.1C Radio Link Monitoring for Satellite Access
-----------------------------------------------

### 8.1C.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 8.1C apply for radio link monitoring on PCell
and the UE is configured with only PCell, which is served by satellite
access node (SAN). The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality
based on the reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order
to detect the downlink radio link quality of the PCell as specified in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all
CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required to perform RLM
outside the active DL BWP.

On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio link
quality and compare it to the thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the
purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell.

The threshold Q~out~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the out-of-sync
block error rate (BLER~out~) as defined in table 8.1C.1-1. For SSB based
radio link monitoring, Q~out\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1C.2.1-1. For CSI-RS
based radio link monitoring, Q~out\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1C.3.1-1.

The threshold Q~in~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link quality can be received with significantly higher reliability than
at Q~out~ and shall correspond to the in-sync block error rate
(BLER~in~) as defined in table 8.1C.1-1. For SSB based radio link
monitoring, Q~in\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in table 8.1C.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based
radio link monitoring, Q~in\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1C.3.1-2.

The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out~) and in-sync block error
rate (BLER~in~) are determined from the network configuration via
parameter *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* signalled by higher layers. When
UE is not configured with *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* from the
network, UE determines out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from
Configuration \#0 in table 8.1C.1-1 by default. All requirements in
clause 8.1C are applicable for BLER Configuration \#0 in table 8.1C.1-1.

  Configuration   BLER~out~   BLER~in~
  --------------- ----------- ----------
  0               10 %        2 %

UE shall be able to monitor up to N~RLM~ RLM-RS resources of the same or
different types in each corresponding carrier frequency range, depending
on a maximum number L~max~ of SSBs per half frame according to TS 38.213
\[3\], where N~RLM~ is specified in table 8.1C.1-2 according TS 38.213
\[3\], and meet the requirements as specified in clause 8.1C. UE is not
required to meet the requirements in clause 8.1C if RLM-RS is not
configured and no TCI state for PDCCH is activated.

#### 8.1C.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ evaluation period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ period becomes better than the threshold Q~in\_SSB~
within T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in table
8.1C.2.2-1 and table 8.1C.2.2-2 for FR1 and FR2-NTN, respectively.

P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is the
maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and starting
at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W, if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For an FR1 and FR2-NTN serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

#### 8.1C.2.3 Measurement restrictions for SSB based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1 and FR2-NTN, when the SSB for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for RLM without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

### 8.1C.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring

#### 8.1C.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS based RLM-RS
resource configured for PCell, provided that the CSI-RS configured for
RLM is actually transmitted within UE active DL BWP during the entire
evaluation period specified in clause 8.1C.3.2. UE is not expected to
perform radio link monitoring measurements on the CSI-RS configured as
RLM-RS if the CSI-RS is not in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP.

#### 8.1C.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ evaluation period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ evaluation period.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
table 8.1C.3.2-1 for FR1.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
table 8.1C.3.2-2 for FR2-NTN.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~
apply provided that the CSI-RS for RLM is not in a resource set
configured with repetition ON. The requirements do not apply when the
CSI-RS resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS
resource for RLM and the TCI state information of the CSI-RS resource is
not given, wherein the TCI state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for
L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is the
maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and starting
at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W, if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For an FR1 and FR2-NTN serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

The values of M~out~ and M~in~ used in table 8.1C.3.2-1 are defined as:

\- M~out~ = 20 and M~in~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource configured for RLM
is transmitted with higher layer CSI-RS parameter *density* \[6, clause
7.4.1\] set to 3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

The values of M~out~ and M~in~ used in table 8.1C.3.2-2 are defined as:

\- M~out~ = 40 and M~in~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource configured for RLM
is transmitted with higher layer CSI-RS parameter *density* TS 38.211
\[6\], clause 7.4.1, set to 3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

#### 8.1C.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1 and FR2-NTN, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol
as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for RLM in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1 and FR2-NTN, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, or L1-RSRP
measurement is within the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for
RLM, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without
restrictions.

For FR1 and FR2-NTN, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP
measurement is within the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS
for RLM, the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

> \- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
> shall be able to perform CSI-RS for RLM measurement without
> restrictions.
>
> \- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*,
> UE is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM and SSB.
> Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no
> requirements are defined.

For FR1 and FR2-NTN, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any restriction.

### 8.1C.4 Minimum requirement at transitions

When the UE transitions between DRX and no DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, for each RLM-RS resource, for a duration of time
equal to the evaluation period corresponding toÂ the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first
mode and the second mode. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use
an evaluation period corresponding to the second mode for each RLM-RS
resource. This requirement shall be applied to both out-of-sync
evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the monitored cell.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of RLM resources to a
second configuration of RLM resources that is different from the first
configuration, for each RLM resource present in the second
configuration, for a duration of time equal to the evaluation period
corresponding to the second configuration after the transition occurs,
the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no less than the minimum
of evaluation periods corresponding to the first configuration and the
second configuration. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second configuration for each RLM
resource present in the second configuration. This requirement shall be
applied to both out-of-sync evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the
monitored cell.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of active TCI state
of the CORESET to a second configuration of active TCI state of the
CORESET, for each CSI-RS for RLM present in the second configuration,
the UE shall use an evaluation period corresponding to the second
configuration from the time of transition. This requirement shall be
applied to both out-of-sync evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the
monitored cell.

### 8.1C.5 Minimum requirement for UE turning off the transmitter

The transmitter power of the UE in the monitored cell shall be turned
off within 40 ms after expiry of T310 timer as specified in TS 38.331
\[2\].

### 8.1C.6 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication

When the downlink radio link quality on all the configured RLM-RS
resources is worse than Q~out~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
out-of-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the out-of-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

When the downlink radio link quality on at least one of the configured
RLM-RS resources is better than Q~in~, layer 1 of the UE shall send an
in-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3 filter
shall be applied to the in-sync indications as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

The out-of-sync and in-sync evaluations for the configured RLM-RS
resources shall be performed as specified in clause 5 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval~.

When DRX is not used T~Indication\_interval~ is max(10 ms, T~RLM-RS,M~),
where T~RLM-RS,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all configured RLM-RS
resources for the monitored cell, which corresponds to T~SSB~ specified
in clause 8.1C.2 if the RLM-RS resource is SSB, or T~CSI-RS~ specified
in clause 8.1C.3 if the RLM-RS resource is CSI-RS.

In case DRX is used, T~Indication\_interval~ is Max(10ms, 1.5 Ã—
DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 Ã— T~RLM-RS,M~)) if DRX\_cycle\_length is less
than or equal to 320ms, and T~Indication\_interval~ is
DRX\_cycle\_length if DRX\_cycle\_length is greater than 320ms. Upon
start of T310 timer as specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\], the UE shall
monitor the configured RLM-RS resources for recovery using the
evaluation period and layer 1 indication interval corresponding to the
no DRX mode until the expiry or stop of T310 timer.

### 8.1C.7 Scheduling availability of UE during radio link monitoring

When the reference signal to be measured for RLM has different
subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH , there are restrictions on the
scheduling availability as described in the following clauses.

#### 8.1C.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1 and FR2-NTN

There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
performed with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1 and
FR2-NTN.

#### 8.1C.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1 and FR2-NTN

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to radio link
monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to radio link monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to
be measured for radio link monitoring.

8.1D Radio Link Monitoring for ATG
----------------------------------

### 8.1D.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 8.1D apply for radio link monitoring on ATG
UE.

The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell as specified in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all
CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required to perform RLM
outside the active DL BWP.

On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio link
quality and compare it to the thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the
purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell.

The threshold Q~out~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the out-of-sync
block error rate (BLER~out~) as defined in table 8.1.1-1. For SSB based
radio link monitoring, Q~out\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.2.1-1. For CSI-RS
based radio link monitoring, Q~out\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.3.1-1.

The threshold Q~in~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link quality can be received with significantly higher reliability than
at Q~out~ and shall correspond to the in-sync block error rate
(BLER~in~) as defined in table 8.1.1-1. For SSB based radio link
monitoring, Q~in\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based
radio link monitoring, Q~in\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.1.3.1-2.

The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out~) and in-sync block error
rate (BLER~in~) are determined from the network configuration via
parameter *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* signalled by higher layers. When
UE is not configured with *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* from the
network, UE determines out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from
Configuration \#0 in table 8.1.1-1 by default. All requirements in
clause 8.1D are applicable for BLER Configuration \#0 in table 8.1.1-1.

Table 8.1D.1-1: Void

UE shall be able to monitor up to N~RLM~ RLM-RS resources of the same or
different types in each corresponding carrier frequency range, depending
on a maximum number L~max~ of SSBs per half frame according to TS 38.213
\[3\], where N~RLM~ is specified in table 8.1D.1-2 according TS 38.213
\[3\], and meet the requirements as specified in clause 8.1D. UE is not
required to meet the requirements in clause 8.1D if RLM-RS is not
configured and no TCI state for PDCCH is activated.

### 8.1D.2 Requirements for SSB based radio link monitoring

#### 8.1D.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB based RLM-RS resource
configured for PCell, provided that the SSB configured for RLM is

#### 8.1D.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ evaluation period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ period becomes better than the threshold Q~in\_SSB~
within T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in table
8.1D.2.2-1 for FR1.

For FR1 ATG UE with one or multiple omni-directional antenna(s),

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for intra-frequency
or inter-frequency measurements, and these measurement gaps are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB; and

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR1 ATG UE with the antenna array,

\- P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1~, MGRP~max~), where MGRP~max~ is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with measurement gap occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any measurement gap occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any measurement gap occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

#### 8.1D.2.3 Measurement restrictions for SSB based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for
RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for RLM without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer
measurement period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

### 8.1D.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring

#### 8.1D.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS based RLM-RS
resource configured for PCell, provided that the CSI-RS configured for
RLM is actually transmitted within UE active DL BWP during the entire
evaluation period specified in clause 8.1D.3.2. UE is not expected to
perform radio link monitoring measurements on the CSI-RS configured as
RLM-RS if the CSI-RS is not in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP.

Table 8.1D.3.1-1: Void

Table 8.1D.3.1-2: Void

#### 8.1D.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ evaluation period.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ evaluation period.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
table 8.1D.3.2-1 for FR1.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~
apply provided that the CSI-RS for RLM is not in a resource set
configured with repetition ON. The requirements do not apply when the
CSI-RS resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS
resource for RLM and the TCI state information of the CSI-RS resource is
not given, wherein the TCI state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for
L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

For FR1 ATG UE with one or multiple omni-directional antenna(s),

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for intra-frequency
or inter-frequency measurements, and these measurement gaps are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P = 1, when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR1 ATG UE with the antenna array,

\- P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1~, MGRP~max~), where MGRP~max~ is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and
starting at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with measurement gap occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any measurement gap occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any measurement gap occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

The values of M~out~ and M~in~ used in table 8.1D.3.2-1 are defined as:

\- M~out~ = 20 and M~in~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource configured for RLM
is transmitted with higher layer CSI-RS parameter *density* \[6, clause
7.4.1\] set to 3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

#### 8.1D.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS based RLM

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as SSB for
RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not required to receive
CSI-RS for RLM in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, or L1-RSRP measurement is
within the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the UE shall
be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions according to its
capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS for RLM measurement without
restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM and SSB.
Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as another
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be able to
measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any restriction.

### 8.1D.4 Minimum requirement at transitions

The requirement in clause 8.1.4 shall apply.

### 8.1D.5 Minimum requirement for UE turning off the transmitter

The requirement in clause 8.1.5 shall apply.

### 8.1D.6 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication

The requirements in clause 8.1.6 shall apply only for UE in NR SA
operation mode.

### 8.1D.7 Scheduling availability of UE during radio link monitoring

When the reference signal to be measured for RLM has different
subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH, there are restrictions on the
scheduling availability as described in the following clauses.

#### 8.1D.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
performed with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1.

#### 8.1D.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing radio link monitoring with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to radio link
monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to radio link monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols to
be measured for radio link monitoring.

The requirements shall apply for E-UTRA-NR-DC with an E-UTRA PCell.

This clause contains interruptions where victim cell is PSCell or SCell
belonging to SCG. Requirements for interruptions requirements when the
victim cell is E-UTRA PCell or E-UTRA SCell belonging to MCG are
specified in TSÂ 36.133Â \[15\].

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gaps, interruptions
to the PSCell or activated SCG SCells may be caused by EUTRA PCell,
EUTRA SCells or SCells on any frequency range. For UE which support
per-FR gaps, interruptions to the PSCell or activated SCG SCells may be
caused by EUTRA PCell, EUTRA SCells or SCells on the same frequency
range as the victim cell.

#### 8.2.1.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.1.2.1 Interruptions at transitions between active and non-active during DRX

Interruption on PSCell and the activated SCell if configured due to
E-UTRA PCell transitions between active and non-active during DRX when
PSCell or SCell is in non-DRX are allowed with up to 1% probability of
missed ACK/NACK when the configured E-UTRA PCell DRX cycle is less than
640 ms, and 0.625% probability of missed ACK/NACK is allowed when the
configured E-UTRA PCell DRX cycle is 640 ms or longer. Each interruption

##### 8.2.1.2.7 Interruptions due to Active BWP switching Requirement

The requirements for DCI-based BWP switch, timer-based BWP switch or UL
BWP switch triggered by consistent uplink CCA failures in this clause
apply to the case that the BWP switch is performed on a single CC or
multiple CCs.

When either of the DCI-based, timer-based or RRC-based downlink BWP
switch and/or uplink BWP switch occur on multiple CCs simultaneously or
over partially overlapping period, the interruption requirements
described in this clause apply for each BWP switch.

When UE receives a DCI indicating UE to switch its active BWP involving
changes in any of the parameters listed in table 8.2.1.2.7-2, the UE is
allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active serving
cells if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching
involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the
parameters listed in table 8.2.1.2.7-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR
gap, the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other
active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE is
performing BWP switching. X is defined in table 8.2.1.2.7-1. The
starting time of interruption is only allowed within the BWP switching
delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2 when BWP switch
occurs on a single CC. The starting time of interruption caused by each
BWP switch is only allowed within the BWP switch delay
T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ +Y as defined in clause 8.6.2A.1 when BWP
switch occurs on multiple CCs. Interruptions are not allowed during BWP
switch involving any other parameter change.

When a BWP timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* defined in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\]
expires, UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other
active serving cells due to switching its active BWP involving changes
in any of the parameters listed in table 8.2.1.2.7-2 if the UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching involves SCS changing.
When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the parameters listed in
table 8.2.1.2.7-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed
to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active serving cells in
the same frequency range wherein the UE is performing BWP switching. X
is defined in table 8.2.1.2.7-1. The starting time of interruption is
only allowed within the BWP switching delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined
in clause 8.6.2 when BWP switch occurs on a single CC. The starting time
of interruption caused by each BWP switch is only allowed within the BWP
switch delay T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2B.1
when BWP switch occurs on multiple CCs simultaneously or
**T**~MultipleBWPswitchDelayTotal~ as defined in clause 8.6.2B.2 when
BWP switch occurs on multiple CCs over partially overlapping time
period. Interruptions are not allowed during BWP switch involving any
other parameter change.

When UE receives an RRC reconfiguration that only requests UE to switch
its active BWP on one single CC, the UE is allowed to cause interruption
of up to X slots to other active serving cells due to switching its
active BWP involving changes in any of the parameters listed in table
8.2.1.2.7-2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP
switching involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in
any of the parameters listed in tableÂ 8.2.1.2.7-2 and the UE is capable
of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots
to other active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE
is performing BWP switching. X is defined in tableÂ 8.2.1.2.7-1. The
interruption is only allowed within the delay T~RRCprocessingDelay~ +
T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ defined in clauseÂ 8.6.3 when BWP switch occurs on a
single CC. The interruption is only allowed within the delay
T~RRCprocessingDelay~ + T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ + D~RRC~\*(N-1) as defined
in clause 8.6.3A when BWP switch occurs on multiple CCs.

When UL BWP switch is triggered by consistent uplink CCA failures \[7\],
the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active
serving cells due to switching its active UL BWP involving changes in
any of the parameters listed in table 8.2.1.2.7-2 if the UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or if the UL BWP switching involves SCS changing.
When the UL BWP switch imposes changes in any of the parameters listed
in table 8.2.1.2.7-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR gap, the UE is
allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active serving
cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE is performing UL BWP
switching. X is defined in table 8.2.1.2.7-1. The starting time of
interruption is only allowed within the UL BWP switching delay
T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2. Interruptions are not
allowed during UL BWP switch involving other parameter change.

##### 8.2.1.2.12 Interruptions at NR SRS carrier based switching

SRS transmission can be configured on a carrier not configured for
PUCCH/PUSCH transmission. When a UE needs to transmit periodic,
semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS on a carrier of a serving cell not
configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission, the UE can perform carrier
based switching to one or more carriers not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH
transmission from a carrier with PUCCH/PUSCH transmission or from a
carrier not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission prior to
transmitting SRS, provided that:

\- switching is from a configured carrier to an active UL BWP of another
activated carrier;

\- the carrier of SCells not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission to
which SRS carrier based switching is performed is indicated by DCI SRS
request field for aperiodic SRS transmission, or indicated by MAC-CE for
semi-persistent SRS transmission, or configured via RRC for periodic SRS
transmission;

> \- the serving cell, from which SRS carrier based switching is
> performed and whose UL transmission may therefore be interrupted, is
> indicated by srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex and srs-SwitchFromCarrier in
> TS 38.331 \[2\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other transmission with
> higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any SSB/CSI-RS based L3
> measurements and the measurements for RLM/BFD in SCG;

\- for UE, which does not support simultaneous reception and
transmission for inter-band TDD CA specified in TS 38.331 \[2\], and is
compliant to the requirements for inter-band CA with uplink in one NR
band and without simultaneous Rx/Tx specified in TS 38.101-3 \[20\], the
SRS transmission are not simultaneously scheduled with DL SSB/CSI-RS for
L3 or L1 measurements transmission on other carriers.

The UE shall not perform SRS carrier based switching if the above
conditions cannot be met.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in SCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in SCG in FR1 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a
serving cell in FR1 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slots as specified in table 8.2.1.2.12-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in SCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in SCG in FR2 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a
serving cell in FR2 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X2 slots as specified in table 8.2.1.2.12-2.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in SCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in SCG in FR1 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a
serving cell in FR1 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slots as specified in table 8.2.1.2.12-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in SCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in SCG in FR2 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a

##### 8.2.1.2.13 Interruptions at E-UTRA SRS carrier based switching

A PUSCH-less carrier of E-UTRA SCell is a TDD carrier without
PUCCH/PUSCH configured. When a UE needs to transmit periodic or
aperiodic SRS \[23\] and/or non-contention based PRACH on a PUSCH-less
carrier of E-UTRA SCell, the UE can perform carrier based switching to
one or more PUSCH-less carrier of E-UTRA SCells from a E-UTRA carrier
with PUSCH or from another PUSCH-less E-UTRA carrier of SCell prior to
transmitting SRS and/or PRACH, provided that:

\- switching is from a configured E-UTRA carrier to another activated
TDD E-UTRA carrier;

\- the PUSCH-less carrier of E-UTRA SCells to which SRS carrier based
switching is performed is indicated by DCI SRS request field for
aperiodic SRS transmission or configured via RRC \[15\] for periodic SRS
transmission;

\- the E-UTRA serving cell, from which SRS carrier based switching is
performed and whose UL transmission may therefore be interrupted, is
indicated by srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex \[15\];

> the SRS switching is not colliding with any other transmission with
> higher priority defined in TS 36.213 \[39\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with PDCCH in subframe 0 and 5
> as specified in TS 36.213 \[39\];
>
> \- for UE, which does not support simultaneous reception and

##### 8.2.1.2.14 DL Interruptions at switching between two uplink carriers

The DL interruption requirements at dynamic switching between two uplink
carriers specified in this clause are applicable for an uplink band pair
of an inter-band EN-DC configuration when the capability
*uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod* is present, and is only applicable for uplink
switching mechanism specified in clause 6.1.6 of TS 38.214 \[26\], where
E-UTRA UL carrier is capable of one transmit antenna connector and NR UL
carrier is capable of two transmit antenna connectors, and the two
uplink carriers are in different bands with different carrier
frequencies.

When dynamic switching between two uplink carriers is conducted, UE is
allowed to cause DL interruption of X OFDM symbols in NR downlink
carrier(s) as indicated by *uplinkTxSwitching-DL-Interruption* \[2\].
The DL interruption starts from the first OFDM symbol which fully or
partially overlaps with the UL switching period located in NR carrier.
The DL interruption lengths of X for NR carrier(s) are defined in table
8.2.1.2.14-1.

No DL interruption is allowed in the NR downlink carrier(s) which is not
indicated by *uplinkTxSwitching-DL-Interruption*. No DL interruption is
allowed for some inter-band EN-DC configurations as specified in clause
5.5B.4 of TS 38.101-3 \[20\].

##### 8.2.1.2.18 Interruptions at NR SRS antenna port switching

The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS antenna port
switching on FR1 and SRS resource(s) is only configured within the last
6 symbols of a slot. For interruption caused by SRS antenna port
switching, the victim cell is based on the entry number of the band
indicated by *txSwitchImpactToRx* and/or *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*
regardless of per-FR MG capability. An UL interruption is allowed on any
of the serving cells as indicated in *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*, and a DL
interruption is allowed on any of the serving cells as indicated in
*txSwitchImpactToRx*.

The UE shall perform SRS antenna port switching only if the below
conditions are met.

> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other UL transmission
> with higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\] if the serving cell
> on which the higher priority transmission is performed is a victim
> cell based on *txSwitchWithAnotherBand* or is the same carrier on
> which SRS is transmitted.
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any NR measurements (i.e.
> SSB/CSI-RS based L1/L3 measurements) and the measurements for
> RLM/BFD/CBD if the serving cell on which theÂ NR measurements and the
> measurements for RLM/BFD/CBDÂ is performed is a victim cell based on
> *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same carrier on which SRS is
> transmitted.

No requirements are defined for SRS antenna port switching if aperiodic
SRS switching is colliding with aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurements
and the serving cell on which the aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement
is configured is indicated in *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same
carrier on which aperiodic SRS is scheduled/configured.

No requirements apply when SRS antenna port switching is colliding with
E-UTRA measurement if the carrier on which theÂ E-UTRA measurement is
performed is indicated inÂ *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same carrier on
which SRS is scheduled/configured.When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a
slot for SRS antenna switching and the aggressor and victim cells are
synchronized, the interruption requirement in table 8.2.1.2.18-1
applies.

When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching and
the aggressor and victim cells are asynchronized, the interruption
requirement in table 8.2.1.2.18-2 applies. For the rest of SRS
configurations, the interruption requirement in table 8.2.1.2.18-3
applies.

When one SCell in SCG configured with PUCCH is activated or deactivated,

> \- The UE is allowed an interruption on active serving cell in SCG as
> defined in clause 8.2.1.2.4.

\- The starting time of interruption shall be within the delay as
defined in clause 8.3.12.

\- For inter-band CA, if the UE is not capable of
*parallelTxPRACH-SRS-PUCCH-PUSCH*, additional interruption is allowed on
SRS/PUCCH/PUSCH of active serving cells when colliding with RACH
transmission on PUCCH SCell. Interruption occurs on the symbols
containing SRS/PUCCH/PUSCH, which overlap with the duration of the PRACH
preamble \[3\] transmitted on the PUCCH SCell.

### 8.2.2 SA: Interruptions with Standalone NR Carrier Aggregation

#### 8.2.2.1 Introduction

This clause contains the requirements related to the interruptions on
PCell and activated SCell if configured, when

> \- up to 7 SCells are configured, de-configured, activated or
> deactivated, or
>
> \- a supplementary UL carrier or an UL carrier is configured or
> de-configured, or
>
> \- measurements on SCC with deactivated SCell in NR SCG, or
>
> \- UL/DL BWP is switched on PCell or SCell, or
>
> \- CGI reading of an NR neighbour cell with autonomous gaps, or
>
> \- CGI reading of an E-UTRA neighbour cell with autonomous gaps, or
>
> \- UE-specific CBW is changed on PCell or SCell, or
>
> \- NR SRS carrier based switching, or
>
> \- NR SRS antenna port switching, or
>
> \- UE dynamic Tx switches between two uplink carriers, or
>
> \- SCell is activated based on aperiodic CSI-RS, or

\- PDCCH ordered RACH on target cell in LTM.

NOTE: interruptions at SCell addition/release, activation/deactivation
and during measurements on SCC may not be required by all UEs.

The interruptions shall not interrupt RRC signalling or ACK/NACKs
related to RRC reconfiguration procedure according to TS 38.331 \[2\]
for SCell addition/release or MAC control signalling according to TS
37.340 \[17\] for SCell activation/deactivation command.

This clause additionally contains requirements related to interruptions
at inter-frequency SFTD between PCell in FR1 and neighbour cell in FR2.

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gap, interruptions to
the PCell and activated SCell may be caused by SCells on any frequency
range. For a UE which supports per-FR gaps, interruptions to PCell and
activated SCell may be caused by SCells on the same frequency range as
the victim cell.

In addition to standalone NR carrier aggregation when no CCA is
configured, the requirements in clause 8.2.2. and all subclauses of
8.2.2 apply when the UE is configured with

> \- A PCell not using CCA in downlink and one or more SCells using CCA
> in downlink, or

\- A PCell and one or more SCells using CCA in downlink.

#### 8.2.2.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.2.2.1 Interruptions at SCell addition/release

When any number of SCells between one and 7 is added or released using
the same *RRCConnectionReconfiguration* message as defined in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\], the UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving
cell during the RRC reconfiguration procedure as follows:

\- of up to X1 slots, if the active serving cell and the SCell being
added or released are in a FR1 band pair or in a FR1+FR2 band pair.

\- of up to X1 slots, if the active serving cell and the SCell being
added or released are in a FR2 band pair and UE is capable of
independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

\- of up to X1 slots, if the active serving cell is non-contiguous to
the SCell being added or released in the same FR1 band and UE is capable
of *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided.

Where X1 is specified in table 8.2.2.2.1-1.

> or

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.2.2.1-2, if the active
serving cells are contiguous to any of the SCells being added or
released in the same FR1 band, or if the active serving cells are
non-contiguous to any of the SCells being added or released in the same
FR1 band and UE is not capable of *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* or
UE is capable of *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided, provided the cell specific
reference signals from the active serving cells and the SCells being
added or released are available in the same slot.

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.2.2.1-2, if the active
serving cells are in the same FR2 band as any of the SCells being added
or released, provided the cell specific reference signals from the
active serving cells and the SCells being added or released are
available in the same slot.

##### 8.2.2.2.3 Interruptions during measurements on deactivated SCC

Interruptions on PCell or activated SCell(s) due to measurements when an
SCell is deactivated are allowed with up to 0.5 % probability of missed
ACK/NACK when the configured *measCycleSCell \[2\] is 640 ms or longer.*

\- If the PCell or activated SCell(s) is not in the same band as the
deactivated SCell, the UE is only allowed to cause interruptions on
PCell or activated SCell(s) immediately before and immediately after an
SMTC. Each interruption shall not exceed requirement in table
8.2.2.2.2-1.

\- If the PCell or activated SCell(s) is non-contiguous to the
deactivated SCell in the same FR1 band and UE is capable of
*intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* on this FR1 band and
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, the UE is only allowed
to cause interruptions on PCell or activated SCell(s) immediately before
and immediately after an SMTC. Each interruption shall not exceed
requirement in table 8.2.2.2.2-1.

\- If the PCell or activated SCell(s) is contiguous to the deactivated
SCell in the same FR1 band, or if the PCell or activated SCell(s) is
non-contiguous to the deactivated SCell in the same FR1 band and UE is
not capable of *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* or UE is capable of
*intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and ***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18***
is provided, the UE is only allowed to cause an interruption on PCell or
activated SCell(s) no earlier than X slots before T~SMTC\_duration~ and
no later than X slots after T~SMTC\_duration~, provided the cell
specific reference signals from the active serving cells and the
deactivated SCell are available in the same slot, where X and
T~SMTC\_duration~ are given by table 8.2.2.2.3-1. The interruption shall
not exceed requirements in table 8.2.2.2.3-1.

\- If the PCell or activated SCell(s) is in the same FR2 band as the
deactivated SCell, the UE is only allowed to cause an interruption on
PCell or activated SCell(s) no earlier than X slots before
T~SMTC\_duration~ and no later than X slots after T~SMTC\_duration~,
provided the cell specific reference signals from the active serving
cells and the deactivated SCell are available in the same slot, where X
and T~SMTC\_duration~ are given by table 8.2.2.2.3-1. The interruption
shall not exceed requirements in table 8.2.2.2.3-1.

The interruption requirements in table 8.2.2.2.3-1 are not applicable
when a UE is configured with NCSG in the same frequency range as the
deactivated SCell *unless the SMTC on the deactivated SCC is fully
non-overlapped with NCSG.*

##### 8.2.2.2.5 Interruptions due to Active BWP switching Requirement

The requirements for DCI-based BWP switch, timer-based BWP switch or UL
BWP switch triggered by consistent uplink CCA failures in this clause
apply to the case that the BWP switch is performed on a single CC or
multiple CCs.

When either of the DCI-based, timer-based or RRC-based downlink BWP
switch and/or uplink BWP switch occur on multiple CCs simultaneously or
over partially overlapping period, the interruption requirements
described in this clause apply for each BWP switch. Further, the
requirements in this clause are applicable to UE capable of independent
beam management in FR2 inter-band CA and UE capable of FR2 intra-band CA
and FR1.

When UE receives a DCI indicating UE to switch its active BWP involving
changes in any of the parameters listed in table 8.2.2.2.5-2, the UE is
allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active serving
cells if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching
involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the
parameters listed in table 8.2.2.2.5-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR
gap the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other
active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE is
performing BWP switching. X is defined in table 8.2.2.2.5-1. The
starting time of interruption is only allowed within the BWP switching
delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2 when BWP switch
occurs on a single CC. The starting time of interruption caused by each
BWP switch is only allowed within the BWP switch delay
T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ +Y as defined in clause 8.6.2A.1 when BWP
switch occurs on multiple CCs. Interruptions are not allowed during BWP
switch involving any other parameter change.

When a BWP timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* defined in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\]
expires, UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other
active serving cells due to switching its active BWP involving changes
in any of the parameters listed in table 8.2.2.2.5-2 if the UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching involves SCS changing.
When the BWP switch imposes changes in any of the parameters listed in
table 8.2.2.2.5-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed
to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active serving cells in
the same frequency range wherein the UE is performing BWP switching. X
is defined in table 8.2.2.2.5-1. The starting time of interruption is
only allowed within the BWP switching delay T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined
in clause 8.6.2 when BWP switch occurs on a single CC. The starting time
of interruption caused by each BWP switch is only allowed within the BWP
switch delay T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2B.1
when BWP switch occurs on multiple CCs simultaneously or
**T**~MultipleBWPswitchDelayTotal~ as defined in clause 8.6.2B.2 when
BWP switch occurs on multiple CCs over partially overlapping time
period. Interruptions are not allowed during BWP switch involving any
other parameter change.

When UE receives an RRC reconfiguration that only requests UE to switch
its active BWP on one single CC, the UE is allowed to cause interruption
of up to X slots to other active serving cells due to switching its
active BWP involving changes in any of the parameters listed in table
8.2.2.2.5-2 if the UE is not capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP
switching involves SCS changing. When the BWP switch imposes changes in
any of the parameters listed in tableÂ 8.2.2.2.5-2 and the UE is capable
of per-FR gap, the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots
to other active serving cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE
is performing BWP switching. X is defined in tableÂ 8.2.2.2.5-1. The
interruption is only allowed within the delay T~RRCprocessingDelay~ +
T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ defined in clauseÂ 8.6.3 when BWP switch occurs on a
single CC. The interruption is only allowed within the delay
T~RRCprocessingDelay~ + T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ + D~RRC~\*(N-1) as defined
in clause 8.6.3A when BWP switch occurs on multiple CCs.

When UL BWP switch is triggered by consistent uplink CCA failures \[7\],
UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active
serving cells due to switching its active UL BWP involving changes in
any of the parameters listed in table 8.2.2.2.5-2 if the UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or if the BWP switching involves SCS changing.
When the UL BWP switch imposes changes in any of the parameters listed
in table 8.2.2.2.5-2 and the UE is capable of per-FR gap, the UE is
allowed to cause interruption of up to X slots to other active serving
cells in the same frequency range wherein the UE is performing UL BWP
switching. X is defined in table 8.2.2.2.5-1. The starting time of
interruption is only allowed within the UL BWP switching delay
T~BWPswitchDelay~ as defined in clause 8.6.2. Interruptions are not
allowed during BWP switch involving other parameter change.

##### 8.2.2.2.7 Interruptions at SCell activation/deactivation with multiple downlink SCells

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
PCell and up to 7 downlink SCell(s).

When multiple SCell is activated or deactivated by one single MAC CE
command, the UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving cell as
specified in clause 8.2.2.2.2:

##### 8.2.2.2.8 Interruptions due to UE-specific CBW change

When UE receives an RRC reconfiguration that changes *offsetToCarrier*
or *carrierBandwidth*, the UE is allowed to cause interruption of up to
X slots to other active serving cells due to switching its CBW. X is
defined in tableÂ 8.2.2.2.8-1. The interruption is only allowed within
the delay T~RRCprocessingDelay~ + T~CBWchangeDelayRRC~ defined in
clauseÂ 8.13.

##### 8.2.2.2.9 Interruptions at NR SRS carrier based switching

SRS transmission can be configured on a carrier not configured for
PUCCH/PUSCH transmission. When a UE needs to transmit periodic,
semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS on a carrier of a serving cell not
configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission, the UE can perform carrier
based switching to one or more carriers not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH
transmission from a carrier with PUCCH/PUSCH transmission or from a
carrier not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission prior to
transmitting SRS, provided that:

\- switching is from a configured carrier to another activated carrier;

\- the carrier of SCells not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission to
which SRS carrier based switching is performed is indicated by DCI SRS
request field for aperiodic SRS transmission, or indicated by MAC-CE for
semi-persistent SRS transmission, or configured via RRC for periodic SRS
transmission;

> \- the serving cell, from which SRS carrier based switching is
> performed and whose UL transmission may therefore be interrupted, is
> indicated by srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex and srs-SwitchFromCarrier in
> TS 38.331 \[2\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other transmission with
> higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any SSB/CSI-RS based L3
> measurements and the measurements for RLM/BFD;

\- for UE, which does not support simultaneous reception and
transmission for inter-band TDD CA specified in TS 38.331 \[2\], and is
compliant to the requirements for inter-band CA with uplink in one NR
band and without simultaneous Rx/Tx specified in TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
FR1 and TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for FR2, the SRS transmission are not
simultaneously scheduled with DL SSB/CSI-RS for L3 or L1 measurements
transmission on other carriers.

The UE shall not perform SRS carrier based switching if the above
conditions cannot be met.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR1 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a serving cell in FR1
not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slot as specified in table 8.2.2.2.9-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR2 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a serving cell in FR2
not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X2 slots as specified in table 8.2.2.2.9-2.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR1 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a serving cell in
FR1 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slots as specified in table 8.2.2.2.9-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR2 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a serving cell in
FR2 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

\- with up to X2 slots as specified in table 8.2.2.2.9-2.

##### 8.2.2.2.16 Interruptions at NR SRS antenna port switching

The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS antenna port
switching on FR1 and SRS resource(s) is only configured within the last
6 symbols of a slot. For interruption caused by SRS antenna port
switching, the victim cell is based on the entry number of the band
indicated by *txSwitchImpactToRx* and/or *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*
regardless of per-FR MG capability. An UL interruption is allowed on any
of the serving cells as indicated in *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*, and a DL
interruption is allowed on any of the serving cells as indicated in
*txSwitchImpactToRx*.

The UE shall perform SRS antenna port switching only if the below
conditions are met.

> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other UL transmission
> with higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\] if the serving cell
> on which the higher priority transmission is performed is a victim
> cell based on *txSwitchWithAnotherBand* or is the same carrier on
> which SRS is transmitted.
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any NR measurements (i.e.
> SSB/CSI-RS based L1/L3 measurements) and the measurements for
> RLM/BFD/CBD if the serving cell on which theÂ NR measurements and the
> measurements for RLM/BFD/CBDÂ is performed is a victim cell based on
> *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same carrier on which SRS is
> transmitted.

No requirements are defined for SRS antenna port switching if aperiodic
SRS switching is colliding with aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurements
and the serving cell on which the aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement
is configured is indicated in *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same
carrier on which aperiodic SRS is scheduled/configured.

When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching, the
interruption requirement in table 8.2.2.2.16-1 applies. For the rest of
SRS configurations, the interruption requirement in table 8.2.2.2.16-3
applies.

##### 8.2.2.2.17 Interruptions at fast SCell activation

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
PCell and one SCell when aperiodic CSI-RS resources is configured for
fast SCell activation.

When one SCell in MCG configured with aperiodic CSI-RS resources is
configured for fast SCell activation is activated from deactivated, the
UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving cell:

> \- of up to X2 slots, if the active serving cell and the SCell being
> activated are in a FR1 band pair or in a FR1+FR2 band pair.
>
> \- of up to X2 slots, if the active serving cell and the SCell being
> activated are in a FR2 band pair and UE is capable of independent beam
> management on this FR2 band pair.
>
> Where X2 is specified in table 8.2.2.2.2-1.
>
> or
>
> \- of up to Y2 slots +T~ATRS\_duration~, if the active serving cells
> are in the same band as any of the SCells being activated, when
>
> \- SCell to be activated is known and belongs to FR1, if the
> measurement period of the SCell being activated is larger than 2400ms,
> or
>
> \- SCell is unknown and belongs to FR1, and SCell is contiguous to an
> active serving cell in the same band.
>
> or

\- of up to Y2 slots if the active serving cells are in the same band as
any of the SCells being activated, when

\- SCell to be activated is known and belongs to FR1, if the measurement
period of the SCell being activated is equal to or smaller than 2400 ms,
or

\- SCell to be activated belongs to FR2

Where:

\- T~ATRS\_duration~ is CSI-RS burst for SCell activation where the
CSI-RS burst is defined as four CSI-RS resources in two consecutive
slots on the being activated SCell.

\- Y2 are specified in table 8.2.1.2.4-2.

##### 8.2.2.2.18 Interruptions due to PUCCH SCell activation/deactivation

When one SCell configured with PUCCH is activated or deactivated,

\- The UE is allowed an interruption on active serving cell as defined
in clause 8.2.2.2.2.

\- The starting time of interruption shall be within the delay as
defined in clause 8.3.12.

\- For inter-band CA, if the UE is not capable of
*parallelTxPRACH-SRS-PUCCH-PUSCH*, additional interruption is allowed on
SRS/PUCCH/PUSCH of active serving cells when colliding with RACH
transmission on PUCCH SCell. Interruption occurs on the symbols
containing SRS/PUCCH/PUSCH, which overlap with the duration of the PRACH
preamble \[3\] transmitted on the PUCCH SCell.

##### 8.2.2.2.19 Interruptions due to measurements without gap carried out by UE supporting *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR*

When a UE supports *NeedForInterruptionInfoNR-r18* and indicates
*no-gap-with-interruption* on intra-frequency SSB-based or
inter-frequency SSB-based measurements, the UE is allowed to cause
interruptions while performing measurements on the frequency layers of
the bands for which *no-gap-with-interruption* is indicated.

The UE is allowed to cause interruption on each of the active serving
cells due to UE measurements without gap on a certain frequency layer
*i* which equals to $\frac{2L}{T_{cycle,i}}$, where

\- T~cycle,i~ is the interruption cycle on a certain frequency layer i,
specified in table 8.2.2.2.19-1, and

\- CSSF~outside\_gap,i~ is defined in clause 9.1.5.1 for measurement
conducted outside measurement gaps.

Table 8.2.2.2.19-1: T~cycle,i~ length for inter/intra-frequency
measurement on frequency layer *i*

  DRX cycle            T~Cycle,i~
  -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  No DRX               max (80 ms, SMTC period) x CSSF~outside\_gap,i~
  DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms   1.5\*max(80 ms, SMTC period, DRX cycle) x CSSF~outside\_gap,i~
  DRX cycle\>320 ms    DRX cycle x CSSF~outside\_gap,i~

The total allowed maximum interruption ratio (D) on any active serving
cell if UE does not support per-FR measurement gaps or in the same FR if
UE supports per-FR measurement gaps is specified as

$D = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\frac{2L}{T_{\text{cycle},i}}$

Where,

\- N is the total number of configured SSB based frequency layers to be
measured outside gap including intra-frequency and inter-frequency
target carriers in the bands where UE indicates that interruption is
needed through *no-gap-with-interruption*, and

\- L is the maximum interruption length for each interruption occasion
specified in table 8.2.2.2.19-2 and 8.2.2.2.19-3.

When no SMTC occasion of the NR measurement objects occurs within the
time period which starts from 2 ms before the starting point of the DRX
ON duration to 2 ms after the ending point of the DRX ON duration, UE is
not allowed to cause interruption during DRX ON duration except the time
duration extended due to *drx-inactivityTimer*.

##### 8.2.2.2.20 Interruptions due to PDCCH ordered RACH on target LTM cell

When PRACH transmission is triggered by PDCCH order on target LTM cell,

\- During RACH transmission, the UE is allowed an interruption on
activated serving cell's DL slot(s) overlapped with RACH occasion
depending on UE capability *pdcch-RACH-AffectedBandsList-r18*.

\- If UE indicates NoInterruption for an activated serving band in the
pdcch-RACH-AffectedBandsList-r18, the UE shall not cause interruption on
DL slot(s) overlapped with RACH occasion for the serving band indicated
in the band pair.

\- If UE indicates Interruption for an activated serving band in the
pdcch-RACH-AffectedBandsList-r18, the UE may cause interruption on DL
slot(s) overlapped with RACH occasion for the serving band indicated in
the band pair.

\- Before and after PRACH transmission, UE is allowed an interruption on
any activated serving cell as follows:

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.2.2.20-1, if PRACH bandwidth
is outside active UL BWP but within one of configured UL BWPs of any
active serving cell, or

\- of up to ceil(Y/NR Slot length)+1 slots, where Yms as reported in
*pdcch-RACH-SwitchingTimeList-r18*, if PRACH bandwidth is outside any of
the configured UL BWPs of any active serving cell

\- of up to ceil((Y+1)/NR Slot length)+1 slots, where Yms as reported in
*pdcch-RACH-SwitchingTimeList-r18*, if PRACH bandwidth is outside any of
the configured UL BWPs of any active serving cell, and if the number of
RRC-configured LTM cells whose PRACH resources are not fully contained
in any of UE's configured UL BWP(s) of serving cell(s) is more than 2,
and if UE is configured with SRS carrier switching.

##### 8.2.2.2.21 Interruptions at NR SRS bandwidth aggregation for positioning

The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS transmission for
positioning with bandwidth aggregation, when SRS resource configured in
a CC without PUSCH/PUCCH is linked for aggregation with an SRS resource
configured in an UL active BWP of a CC with PUSCH/PUCCH.

SRS resource sets across two or three CCs are aggregated for positioning
when UE is configured with linkage information
*SRS-PosResourceSetLinkedForAggBW* specified in TS *38.331 \[2\]*,
provided that:

\- the aggregated SRS transmission satisfy all the conditions defined in
clause 6.2.1.4.2 in TS 38.214 \[26\];

\- the aggregated SRS transmission and the guard period before and after
the SRS transmission are not colliding with any other UL transmission
or/and DL reception with higher priority in victim cells defined in TS
38.214 \[26\];

\- the aggregated SRS transmission plus guard period before and after
does not collide with any NR L3 or L1 measurements on victim cells.

For interruption caused by SRS transmission for positioning with
bandwidth aggregation, the victim cell is identified based on the entry
number of the band indicated by UE in *posSRS-BWA-AffectedBandList-r18*
regardless of per-FR MG capability.

NOTE 1: UE may indicate no other bands in the band combination are
affected by the SRS carrier switching, in which case, only the band with
the aggregated SRS transmissions is affected.

NOTE 2: If the capability is not indicated, interruption is allowed on
all serving cells.

For each SRS transmission, interruption is allowed on any active serving
cell on the band as indicated in *posSRS-BWA-AffectedBandList-r18*,
during the guard periods before and after aggregated SRS transmission
and the aggregated SRS transmission duration with up to X OFDM symbols,
where X equals to (Y+Z+1). Interruption length of one extra OFDM symbol
is added to cover the impact of receive timing difference between
aggressor and victim cells.

The supported guard period is reported by UE in *guardPeriod* in
*PosSRS-BWA-IndependentCA-RRC-Connected-r18* \[2\] and the total
duration Y of guard periods before and after aggregated SRS transmission
is converted into number of OFDM symbols in table 8.2.2.2.21-1.

This clause contains the requirements related to the interruptions on
PCell and SCell, when

> \- E-UTRA PSCell transitions between active and non-active during DRX,
> or
>
> \- E-UTRA PSCell transitions from non-DRX to DRX, or
>
> \- E-UTRA PSCell/SCell in SCG or SCell in MCG is added or released, or
>
> \- E-UTRA PSCell/SCell in SCG or SCell(s) in MCG is activated or
> deactivated, or
>
> \- measurements on SCC with deactivated SCell in either E-UTRA SCG or
> NR MCG or
>
> \- PUSCH/PUCCH carrier configuration and deconfiguration in NR MCG, or
>
> \- UL/DL BWP is switched on PCell or SCell in MCG, or
>
> \- UE-specific CBW is changed on PCell or SCell in MCG, or
>
> \- CGI reading of an NR neighbour cell with autonomous gaps, or
>
> \- CGI reading of an E-UTRA neighbour cell with autonomous gaps, or

\- SCell in NR MCG is activated based on aperiodic CSI-RS.

The requirements shall apply for NE-DC with an NR PCell.

This clause contains interruptions where victim cell is PCell or SCell
belonging to MCG. Requirements for interruptions requirements when the
victim cell is E-UTRA PSCell or E-UTRA SCell belonging to SCG are
specified in TSÂ 36.133Â \[15\].

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gap, interruptions to
the PCell, E-UTRA PSCell or activated MCG SCells may be caused by EUTRA
PSCell, EUTRA SCells or SCells on any frequency range. For UE which
support per-FR gap, interruptions to the PCell, E-UTRA PSCell or
activated MCG SCells may be caused by EUTRA PSCell, EUTRA SCells or
SCells on the same frequency range as the victim cell.

#### 8.2.3.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.3.2.1 Interruptions at transitions between active and non-active during DRX

Interruption on PCell and the activated SCell if configured due to
E-UTRA PSCell transitions between active and non-active during DRX when
PCell or SCell is in non-DRX are allowed with up to 1% probability of
missed ACK/NACK when the configured E-UTRA PSCell DRX cycle is less than
640 ms, and 0.625% probability of missed ACK/NACK is allowed when the
configured E-UTRA PCell DRX cycle is 640 ms or longer. Each interruption
shall not exceed X slots as defined in table 8.2.3.2.1-1.

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
E-UTRA PSCell.

When one E-UTRA PSCell/SCell in SCG is added or released, the UE is
allowed an interruption on any active serving cell in MCG:

> \- of up to X1 slots, if the active serving cell is not in the same
> band as any of the E-UTRA PSCell/SCells being added or released, or
>
> \- of up to max{Y1 slots + T~SMTC\_duration~, 5ms} if the active
> serving cells are in the same band as any of the E-UTRA PSCell/SCells

> or released are available in the same slot, where T~SMTC\_duration~ is
> the longest SMTC duration among all above activated serving cells in
> MCG;
>
> Where X1 and Y1 are specified in table 8.2.3.2.3-1.

When one SCell in MCG is added or released, the UE is allowed an
interruption on any activated serving cell in MCG:

> \- of up to X1 slots, if the active serving cell and the SCell being
> added or released are in a FR1 band pair or in a FR1+FR2 band pair.
>
> \- of up to X1 slots, if the active serving cell and the SCell being
> added or released are in a FR2 band pair and UE is capable of
> independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

> \- of up to Y1 slots + T~SMTC\_duration~ if the active serving cells
> are in the same band as any of the SCells being added or released,
> provided the cell specific reference signals from the active serving
> cells and the SCells being added or released are available in the same
> slot, where, T~SMTC\_duration~ is
>
> \- the longest SMTC duration among all above active serving cells in
> MCG and the SCell being added when one SCell is added. If SSB
> configuration (*absoluteFrequencySSB*) but no SMTC configuration is
> provided for the SCell being added, the SSB transmission periodicity
> is assumed to be 5ms and T~SMTC\ duration~ for the SCell being added
> is x ms, where x = the number of consecutive subframes containing all

Where X2 and Y2 are specified in table 8.2.3.2.4-1.

##### 8.2.3.2.10 Interruptions at SCell activation/deactivation with multiple downlink SCells

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
E-UTRA PSCell and up to 6 downlink SCell(s).

When multiple SCells in MCG are activated or deactivated by one single
MAC CE command, the UE is allowed an interruption on any serving cell in
MCG as specified in clause 8.2.3.2.4.

##### 8.2.3.2.11 Interruptions at NR SRS carrier based switching

SRS transmission can be configured on a carrier not configured for
PUCCH/PUSCH transmission. When a UE needs to transmit periodic,
semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS on a carrier of a serving cell not
configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission, the UE can perform carrier
based switching to one or more carriers not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH
transmission from a carrier with PUCCH/PUSCH transmission or from a
carrier not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission prior to
transmitting SRS, provided that:

\- switching is from a configured carrier to another activated carrier;

\- the carrier of SCells not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission to
which SRS carrier based switching is performed is indicated by DCI SRS
request field for aperiodic SRS transmission, or indicated by MAC-CE for
semi-persistent SRS transmission, or configured via RRC for periodic SRS
transmission;

> \- the serving cell, from which SRS carrier based switching is
> performed and whose UL transmission may therefore be interrupted, is
> indicated by srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex and srs-SwitchFromCarrier in
> TS 38.331 \[2\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other transmission with
> higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\];

\- the SRS switching is not colliding with any SSB/CSI-RS based L3
measurements and the measurements for RLM/BFD in MCG.- for UE, which
does not support simultaneous reception and transmission for inter-band
TDD CA specified in TS 38.331 \[2\], and is compliant to the
requirements for inter-band CA with uplink in one NR band and without
simultaneous Rx/Tx specified in TS 38.101-3 \[20\], the SRS transmission
are not simultaneously scheduled with DL SSB/CSI-RS for L3 or L1
measurements transmission on other carriers.

The UE shall not perform SRS carrier based switching if the above
conditions cannot be met.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in MCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in MCG in FR1 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a
serving cell in FR1 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slots as specified in table 8.2.3.2.11-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in MCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in MCG in FR2 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a
serving cell in FR2 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X2 slots as specified in table 8.2.3.2.11-2.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in MCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in MCG in FR1 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a
serving cell in FR1 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slots as specified in table 8.2.3.2.11-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell in MCG if UE is not
capable of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in MCG in FR2 if UE
is capable of per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a
serving cell in FR2 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

\- with up to X2 slots as specified in table 8.2.3.2.11-2.

##### 8.2.3.2.12 Interruptions at E-UTRA SRS carrier based switching

A PUSCH-less carrier of E-UTRA SCell is a TDD carrier without
PUCCH/PUSCH configured. When a UE needs to transmit periodic or
aperiodic SRS \[23\] and/or non-contention based PRACH on a PUSCH-less
E-UTRA carrier of SCell, the UE can perform carrier based switching to
one or more PUSCH-less carrier of E-UTRA SCells from a E-UTRA carrier
with PUSCH or from another PUSCH-less E-UTRA carrier of SCell prior to
transmitting SRS and/or PRACH, provided that:

\- switching is from a configured E-UTRA carrier to another activated
TDD carrier;

\- the PUSCH-less carrier of E-UTRA SCells to which SRS carrier based
switching is performed is indicated by DCI SRS request field for
aperiodic SRS transmission or configured via RRC \[15\] for periodic SRS
transmission;

\- the E-UTRA serving cell, from which SRS carrier based switching is
performed and whose UL transmission may therefore be interrupted, is
indicated by srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex \[15\];

##### 8.2.3.2.13.1 Interruptions due to SCell dormancy switch {#interruptions-due-to-scell-dormancy-switch-2 .H6}

When one SCell in MCG is switched from dormancy to non-dormancy or from
non-dormancy to dormancy \[7\] when UE is in DRX active time,

\- the UE is allowed an interruption on active serving cell in MCG as
defined in clause 8.2.3.2.7, except that the interruption is allowed
regardless of which parameters change between the dormant BWP and the
non-dormant BWP

\- The starting time of interruption shall be within the dormancy
switching delay as defined in clause 8.6.2.

When multiple SCells in MCG are switched from dormancy to non-dormancy
or vice versa when the UE is in DRX active time, the interruption
requirement described above applies for each BWP switch.

##### 8.2.3.2.13.2 Interruptions due to CQI measurements during SCell dormancy {#interruptions-due-to-cqi-measurements-during-scell-dormancy-2 .H6}

When one or more SCells are in dormancy, the UE is for the purpose of
CQI measurements on the dormant SCell(s) allowed to cause interruptions

8.2.3.2.16 Interruptions at NR SRS antenna port switching

The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS antenna port
switching on FR1 and SRS resource(s) is only configured within the last
6 symbols of a slot. For interruption caused by SRS antenna port
switching, the victim cell is based on the entry number of the band
indicated by *txSwitchImpactToRx* and/or *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*
regardless of per-FR MG capability. An UL interruption is allowed on any
of the serving cells as indicated in *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*, and a DL
interruption is allowed on any of the serving cells as indicated in
*txSwitchImpactToRx*.

The UE shall perform SRS antenna port switching only if the below
conditions are met.

\- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other UL transmission
with higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\] if the serving cell on
which the higher priority transmission is performed is a victim cell
based onÂ *txSwitchWithAnotherBand* or is the same carrier on which SRS
is transmitted.

\- the SRS switching is not colliding with any NR measurements (i.e.
SSB/CSI-RS based L1/L3 measurements) and the measurements for
RLM/BFD/CBD if the serving cell on which theÂ NR measurements and the
measurements for RLM/BFD/CBDÂ is performed is a victim cell based on
*txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same carrier on which SRS is transmitted.

No requirements are defined for SRS antenna port switching if aperiodic
SRS switching is colliding with aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurements
and the serving cell on which the aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement
is configured is indicated in *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same
carrier on which aperiodic SRS is scheduled/configured.

No requirements apply when SRS antenna port switching is colliding with
E-UTRA measurement if the carrier on which theÂ E-UTRA measurement is
performed is indicated inÂ *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same carrier on
which SRS is scheduled/configured.

When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching and
the aggressor and victim cells are synchronized, the interruption
requirement in table 8.2.3.2.16-1 applies. When 1 SRS symbol is
configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching and the aggressor and
victim cells are asynchronized, the interruption requirement in table
8.2.3.2.16-2 applies. For the rest of SRS configurations, the
interruption requirement in table 8.2.3.2.16-3 applies.

##### 8.2.3.2.17 Interruptions at fast SCell activation

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
E-UTRA PSCell and one SCell in MCG when aperiodic CSI-RS resources is
configured for fast SCell activation.

When one SCell in MCG configured with aperiodic CSI-RS resources is
configured for fast SCell activation is activated from deactivated, the
UE is allowed an interruption on any serving cell in MCG:

> \- of up to X2 slots, if the active serving cell is not in the same
> band as any of the SCells being activated, or
>
> \- of up to Y2 slots + T~ATRS\_duration~ if the active serving cells
> are in the same band as any of the SCells being activated, when
>
> \- SCell to be activated is known and belongs to FR1, if the
> measurement period of the SCell being activated is larger than 2400ms,
> or
>
> \- SCell is unknown and belongs to FR1, and SCell is contiguous to an
> active serving cell in the same band.
>
> \- of up to Y2 slots if the active serving cells are in the same band
> as any of the SCells being activated, when
>
> \- SCell to be activated is known and belongs to FR1, if the

\- X2 and Y2 are specified in table 8.2.3.2.4-2.

##### 8.2.3.2.18 Interruptions due to UE-specific CBW change

The requirements in clause 8.2.1.2.11 apply for this clause.

##### 8.2.3.2.19 Interruptions due to PUCCH SCell activation/deactivation

When one SCell in MCG configured with PUCCH is activated or deactivated,

The UE is allowed an interruption on active serving cell in MCG as
defined in clause 8.2.3.2.4.

\- The starting time of interruption shall be within the delay as
defined in clause 8.3.12.

\- For inter-band CA, if the UE is not capable of
*parallelTxPRACH-SRS-PUCCH-PUSCH*, additional interruption is allowed on
SRS/PUCCH/PUSCH of active serving cells when colliding with RACH
transmission on PUCCH SCell. Interruption occurs on the symbols
containing SRS/PUCCH/PUSCH, which overlap with the duration of the PRACH
preamble \[3\] transmitted on the PUCCH SCell.

### 8.2.4 NR-DC: Interruptions

#### 8.2.4.1 Introduction

This clause contains the requirements related to the interruptions on
PCell, PSCell and activated SCell if configured, when

NOTE: interruptions at SCell addition/release, activation/deactivation
and during measurements on SCC may not be required by all UEs.

The interruptions shall not interrupt RRC signalling or ACK/NACKs
related to RRC reconfiguration procedure \[2\] for SCell
addition/release or MAC control signalling \[17\] for SCell
activation/deactivation command.

The requirements shall apply for NR-DC with an NR PCell, PSCell or
SCell.

For a UE which does not support per-FR measurement gap, interruptions to
the PCell and activated SCell may be caused by SCells on any frequency
range. For a UE which supports per-FR gaps, interruptions to PCell,
PSCell and activated SCell may be caused by SCells on the same frequency
range as the victim cell.

#### 8.2.4.2 Requirements

##### 8.2.4.2.1 Interruptions at PSCell/SCell addition/release

When PSCell or one or more SCells is added or released using the same
*RRCConnectionReconfiguration* message as defined in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\],
the UE is allowed an interruption on any activated serving cell during
the RRC reconfiguration procedure as follows:

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.1-1, if the active
serving cell is not in the same band as the PSCell or SCell being added
or released, where the requirements for Sync apply for synchronous
NR-DC, and for asynchronous NR-DC if the active serving cell is in the
same CG as the PSCell or SCell being added or released, and the
requirements for Async apply for asynchronous NR-DC if the active
serving cell is not in the same CG as the PSCell or SCell being added or
released, or

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.1-2, if the active
serving cells are in the same band as the SCell being added or released,
provided the cell specific reference signals from the active serving
cells and the SCell being added or released are available in the same
slot.

##### 8.2.4.2.2 Interruptions at SCell activation/deactivation

When a SCell is activated or deactivated as defined in TSÂ 37.340Â \[17\],
the UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving cell:

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.2-1, if the active
serving cell is not in the same band as any of the SCells being
activated or deactivated, where the requirements for Sync apply for
synchronous NR-DC, and for asynchronous NR-DC if the active serving cell
is in the same CG as all the SCells being activated, and the
requirements for Async apply for asynchronous NR-DC if the active
serving cell is not in the same CG as any of the SCells being activated,
or

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.2-2, if the active
serving cells are in the same band as any of the SCells being activated
or deactivated provided the cell specific reference signals from the
active serving cells and the SCells being activated or deactivated are
available in the same slot.

##### 8.2.4.2.3 Interruptions during measurements on SCC

Interruption on PCell, PSCell and other activated SCell(s) during
measurement on the deactivated NR SCC shall meet requirements in clause
8.2.2.2.3, where the term PCell in clause 8.2.2.2.3 shall be deemed to
be replaced with SpCell.

##### 8.2.4.2.4 Interruptions at UL carrier RRC reconfiguration

The requirements in this clause shall apply when a supplementary UL
carrier or an UL carrier is configured or de-configured in NR-DC as
defined in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

When an UL carrier or supplementary UL carrier is configured or
de-configured, an interruption of up to the duration shown in table
8.2.4.2.4-1, is allowed during the RRC reconfiguration procedure in TS
38.331 \[2\] on all the other activated serving cells within the same FR
as the reconfigured uplink carrier. The interruption is for both uplink
and downlink of all the other serving cells within the same FR as the
configured or de-configured UL.

##### 8.2.4.2.5 Interruptions due to Active BWP switching Requirement

The requirements for DCI-based BWP switch, timer-based BWP switch or UL
BWP switch triggered by consistent uplink CCA failures in this clause
apply to the case that the BWP switch is performed on a single CC or
multiple CCs.

When either of the DCI-based, timer-based or RRC-based downlink BWP
switch and/or uplink BWP switch occur on multiple CCs simultaneously or
over partially overlapping period, the interruption requirements
described in this clause apply for each BWP switch.

When UE receives a DCI indicating the UE to switch its active BWP, or
when a BWP timer bwp-InactivityTimer defined in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\] expires,
or when the UE receives an RRC command indicating the UE to switch its
active BWP or when UL BWP switch is triggered by consistent uplink CCA
failures,, the UE is allowed to cause an interruption on any other
serving cells as defined in clause 8.2.2.2.5. In addition to what is
defined in clause 8.2.2.5, when RRC-based BWP switch occurs on multiple
CCs over partially overlapping period, the interruption is only allowed
within the delay T~RRCprocessingDelay~ + T~Waiting~ +
T~BWPswitchDelayRRC~ + D~RRC~\*(M-1) as defined in clause 8.6.3A.3.
Besides, in asynchronous scenario the UE is allowed an additional
interrupt of 1 slot length.

##### 8.2.4.2.6 Interruptions at transitions between active and non-active during DRX

When PCell is in non-DRX and PSCell is in DRX, interruptions on PCell
and the activated SCell in MCG if configured due to transitions from
active to non-active and from non-active to active during PSCell DRX are
allowed with up to 1 % probability of missed ACK/NACK when the
configured PSCell DRX cycle is less than 640 ms, and 0.625 % probability
of missed ACK/NACK is allowed when the configured PSCell DRX cycle is
640 ms or longer. Each interruption shall not exceed X slots as defined
in table 8.2.4.2.6-1.

When PSCell is in non-DRX and PCell is in DRX, interruptions on PSCell
on the activated SCell in SCG if configured due to transitions from
active to non-active and from non-active to active during PCell DRX are
allowed with up to 1 % probability of missed ACK/NACK when the
configured PCell DRX cycle is less than 640 ms, and 0.625 % probability
of missed ACK/NACK is allowed when the configured PCell DRX cycle is 640
ms or longer. Each interruption shall not exceed X slots as defined in
table 8.2.4.2.6-1.

When both PCell and PSCell are in DRX, no interruption is allowed.

##### 8.2.4.2.7 Interruptions at transitions from non-DRX to DRX

Interruption on PCell and the activated SCell in MCG if configured due
to PSCell transitions from non-DRX to DRX when PCell is in non-DRX shall
not exceed X slots as defined in table 8.2.4.2.6-1.

Interruption on PSCell and the activated SCell in SCG if configured due
to PCell transitions from non-DRX to DRX when PSCell is in non-DRX shall
not exceed X slots as defined in table 8.2.4.2.6-1.

##### 8.2.4.2.8 Interruptions at SCell activation/deactivation with multiple downlink SCells

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
NR-DC and up to 1 downlink SCell in FR1 and up to 7 downlink SCell(s) in
FR2.

When multiple SCell are activated or deactivated by one single MAC CE
command in MCG or SCG, the UE is allowed an interruption on any serving
cell in MCG or SCG as specified in clause 8.2.4.2.2.

When multiple SCell are activated or deactivated in both MCG and SCG by
two MAC CE commands respectively, the UE is allowed an interruption:

> \- on any serving cell in MCG as specified in clause 8.2.4.2.2, and

\- on any serving cell in SCG as specified in clause 8.2.4.2.2.

##### 8.2.4.2.9 Interruptions at NR SRS carrier based switching

SRS transmission can be configured on a carrier not configured for
PUCCH/PUSCH transmission. When a UE needs to transmit periodic,
semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS on a carrier of a serving cell not
configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission, the UE can perform carrier
based switching to one or more carriers not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH
transmission from a carrier with PUCCH/PUSCH transmission or from a
carrier not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission prior to
transmitting SRS, provided that:

\- switching is from a configured carrier to another activated carrier;

\- the carrier of SCells not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission to
which SRS carrier based switching is performed is indicated by DCI SRS
request field for aperiodic SRS transmission, or indicated by MAC-CE for
semi-persistent SRS transmission, or configured via RRC for periodic SRS
transmission;

> \- the serving cell, from which SRS carrier based switching is
> performed and whose UL transmission may therefore be interrupted, is
> indicated by srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex and srs-SwitchFromCarrier in
> TS 38.331 \[2\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other transmission with
> higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\];
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any SSB/CSI-RS based L3
> measurements and the measurements for RLM/BFD in the same CG.- for UE,
> which does not support simultaneous reception and transmission for
> inter-band TDD CA specified in TS 38.331 \[2\], and is compliant to
> the requirements for inter-band CA with uplink in one NR band and
> without simultaneous Rx/Tx specified in TS 38.101-3 \[20\], the SRS
> transmission are not simultaneously scheduled with DL SSB/CSI-RS for
> L3 or L1 measurements transmission on other carriers.

The UE shall not perform SRS carrier based switching if the above
conditions cannot be met.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR1 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a serving cell in FR1
not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slots as specified in table 8.2.4.2.9-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR2 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching to the carrier of a serving cell in FR2
not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X2 slots as specified in table 8.2.4.2.9-2.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR1 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a serving cell in
FR1 not configured for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission,

> \- with up to X1 slots as specified in table 8.2.4.2.9-1.

When SRS carrier based switching is performed between carriers, the UE
is allowed interruptions on any active serving cell if UE is not capable
of per-FR gap, or on active serving cell(s) in FR2 if UE is capable of
per-FR gap, during the switching from the carrier of a serving cell in

##### 8.2.4.2.10 Interruptions at direct SCell activation

When one or multiple SCell(s) are directly activated at SCell addition,
the UE is allowed an interruption on any active serving cell:

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.1-1, if the active
serving cell is not in the same band as the SCell being directly
activated, where the requirements for Sync apply for synchronous NR-DC,
and for asynchronous NR-DC if the active serving cell is in the same CG
as the SCell being directly activated, and the requirements for Async
apply for asynchronous NR-DC if the active serving cell is not in the
same CG as the SCell being directly activated, or

\- of up to the duration shown in table 8.2.4.2.1-2, if the active
serving cells are in the same band as the SCell being directly activated
provided the cell specific reference signals from the active serving
cells and the SCell being directly activated are available in the same
slot.

##### 8.2.4.2.11 Interruptions when identifying CGI of an NR cell with autonomous gaps

When a UE is identifying CGI of an NR cell with autonomous gaps, the UE
is allowed interruptions on PCell, PSCell or any activated SCell:

\- with up to K1 interruptions with interrupted slots up to interruption
length X1 specified in table 8.2.4.2.11-1 for each interruption during
MIB decoding time period T~MIB~ (ms) specified in clause 9.11.

\- with up to L1 interruptions with interrupted slots up to interruption
length Y1 specified in table 8.2.4.2.11-1 for each interruption during
SIB1 decoding time period T~SIB1~ (ms) specified in clause 9.11 for SSB
and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 1.

\- with up to L2 interruptions with interrupted slots up to interruption
length Y2 specified in table 8.2.4.2.11-1 for each interruption during
SIB1 decoding time period T~SIB1~ (ms) specified in clause 9.11 for SSB
and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2 and 3.

Where:

\- K1 = 6 for the target cell carrier frequency on FR1 and K1 = 25 for
the target cell carrier frequency on FR2, and

\- L1 = T~SIB1~/20, and

\- L2 = T~SIB1~/T~SMTC~, where T~SMTC~ is the periodicity of the SMTC
occasion configured for the target cell carrier.

##### 8.2.4.2.13 Interruptions due to SCell dormancy

##### 8.2.4.2.13.1 Interruptions due to SCell dormancy switch {#interruptions-due-to-scell-dormancy-switch-3 .H6}

When one SCell in MCG or SCG is switched from dormancy to non-dormancy
or from non-dormancy to dormancy \[7\] when UE is in DRX active time,

\- the UE is allowed an interruption on active serving cell in MCG and
SCG as defined in clause 8.2.4.2.5, except that the interruption is
allowed regardless of which parameters change between the dormant BWP
and the non-dormant BWP

\- The starting time of interruption shall be within the dormancy
switching delay as defined in clause 8.6.2.

When multiple SCells in MCG or SCG are switched from dormancy to
non-dormancy or vice versa when the UE is in DRX active time, the
interruption requirement described above applies for each BWP switch.

##### 8.2.4.2.13.2 Interruptions due to CQI measurements during SCell dormancy {#interruptions-due-to-cqi-measurements-during-scell-dormancy-3 .H6}

When one or more SCells are in dormancy, the UE is for the purpose of
CQI measurements on the dormant SCell(s) allowed to cause interruptions
to non-dormant serving cell(s).

The rate of ACK/NACK feedback loss on any non-dormant serving cell
resulting from CQI measurements on dormant SCells shall not exceed 0.5
%.

##### 8.2.4.2.13.3 Interruptions due to RRM measurements during SCell dormancy {#interruptions-due-to-rrm-measurements-during-scell-dormancy-3 .H6}

When one or more SCells are in dormancy, the UE is for the purpose of
RRM measurements on the dormant SCell(s) allowed to cause interruptions
to non-dormant serving cell(s).

The rate of ACK/NACK feedback loss on any non-dormant serving cell
resulting from RRM measurements on dormant SCells shall not exceed 1.0
%.

##### 8.2.4.2.14 Interruptions at NR SRS antenna port switching

The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS antenna port
switching on FR1 and SRS resource(s) is only configured within the last
6 symbols of a slot. For interruption caused by SRS antenna port
switching, the victim cell is based on the entry number of the band
indicated by *txSwitchImpactToRx* and/or *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*
regardless of per-FR MG capability. An UL interruption is allowed on any
of the serving cells as indicated in *txSwitchWithAnotherBand*, and a DL
interruption is allowed on any of the serving cells as indicated in
*txSwitchImpactToRx*..

The UE shall perform SRS antenna port switching only if the below
conditions are met.

> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other UL transmission
> with higher priority defined in TS 38.214 \[26\] if the serving cell
> on which the higher priority transmission is performed is a victim
> cell based on *txSwitchWithAnotherBand* or is the same carrier on
> which SRS is transmitted.
>
> \- the SRS switching is not colliding with any NR measurements (i.e.
> SSB/CSI-RS based L1/L3 measurements) and the measurements for
> RLM/BFD/CBD if the serving cell on which theÂ NR measurements and the
> measurements for RLM/BFD/CBDÂ is performed is a victim cell based on
> *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same carrier on which SRS is
> transmitted.

No requirements are defined for SRS antenna port switching if aperiodic
SRS switching is colliding with aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurements
and the serving cell on which the aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR measurement
is configured is indicated in *txSwitchImpactToRx* or is the same
carrier on which aperiodic SRS is scheduled/configured.

When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching and
the aggressor and victim cells are synchronized, the interruption
requirement in table 8.2.4.2.14-1 applies. When 1 SRS symbol is
configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching and the aggressor and
victim cells are asynchronized, the interruption requirement in table
8.2.4.2.14-2 applies. For the rest of SRS configurations, the
interruption requirement in table 8.2.4.2.14-3 applies.

8.3 SCell Activation and Deactivation Delay
-------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall
be able to activate at least one deactivated SCell and deactivate at
least one activated SCell in EN-DC, or in standalone NR carrier
aggregation, or in NE-DC, or in NR-DC.

The requirements shall apply for EN-DC, standalone NR carrier
aggregation, NE-DC, and NR-DC.

### 8.3.2 SCell Activation Delay Requirement for Deactivated SCell

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
at least one downlink SCell in EN-DC, or in standalone NR carrier
aggregation or in NE-DC or in NR-DC and when one SCell is being
activated.

The delay within which the UE shall be able to activate the deactivated
SCell depends upon the specified conditions.

Upon receiving SCell activation command in slot *n*, the UE shall be
capable to transmit valid CSI report and apply actions related toÂ the
activation command for the SCell being activated no later than in slot
$n + \frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + T_{activation\_ time} + T_{CSI\_ Reporting}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$
, where:

T~HARQ~ (in ms) is the timing between DL data transmission and
acknowledgement as specified in TSÂ 38.213 \[3\]

T~activation\_time~ is the SCell activation delay in milliseconds.

If the SCell is known and belongs to FR1, T~activation\_time~ is:

\- T~FirstSSB~+ 5 ms, if the measurement period of the SCell being
activated is equal to or smaller than 2400 ms.

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + T~rs~ + 5 ms, if the measurement period of the
SCell being activated is larger than 2400 ms.

> If the SCell is unknown and belongs to FR1, and if one of the
> following conditions is met
>
> \- 'ssb-PositionInBurst' indicates only one SSB is being actually
> transmitted, or

\- 'ssb-PositionInBurst' indicates multiple SSBs and TCI indication is
provided in same MAC PDU with SCell activation,

provided that the side condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB is fulfilled,
T~activation\_time~ is:

\- If UE supports *shortMeasInterval-r18*, then

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX,\ enhanced~ + T~SMTC\_MAX,\ enhanced~ +
T~rs,\ enhanced~ + 5 ms, if the following conditions are met,

\- the SCell is contiguous to an active serving cell in the same band,
and

\- its *ssb-PositionInBurst* is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active
serving cell, and

\- its SMTC offset is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active serving
cell, and

\- its RTD with contiguous FR1 active serving cell is smaller than or
equal to 260 ns with respect to the to-be-activated SCell's SSB
numerology, and its reception power difference with contiguous FR1
active serving cell is smaller than or equal to 6 dB;

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX,\ enhanced~ + T~SMTC\_MAX,\ enhanced~ +
2\*T~rs,\ enhanced~ + 5 ms, otherwise.

\- Otherwise

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + T~SMTC\_MAX~ + T~rs~ + 5 ms, if the following
conditions are met,

\- the SCell is contiguous to an active serving cell in the same band,
and

\- its *ssb-PositionInBurst* is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active
serving cell, and

\- its SMTC offset is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active serving
cell, and

\- its RTD with contiguous FR1 active serving cell is smaller than or
equal to 260 ns, and its reception power difference with contiguous FR1
active serving cell is smaller than or equal to 6 dB;

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + T~SMTC\_MAX~ + 2\*T~rs~ + 5 ms, otherwise.

Otherwise, provided that the side condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB is fulfilled,
T~activation\_time~ is:

\- If UE supports *shortMeasInterval-r18*, then

\- 6 ms + T~FirstSSB\_MAX,\ enhanced~ + T~SMTC\_MAX,\ enhanced~ +
T~rs,\ enhanced~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ enhanced\_measure~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ report~
+ T~HARQ~ + max(T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + T~FineTiming~ + 2 ms,
T~uncertainty\_SP~), if semi-persistent CSI-RS is used for CSI
reporting,

\- 3 ms + T~FirstSSB\_MAX,\ enhanced~ + T~SMTC\_MAX,\ enhanced~ +
T~rs,\ enhanced~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ enhanced\_measure~ + T~L1-RSRP\ ,report~
+ max(T~HARQ~ + T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + 5 ms + T~FineTiming~,
T~uncertainty\_RRC~ + T~RRC\_delay~), if periodic CSI-RS is used for CSI
reporting.

\- Otherwise

\- 6 ms + T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + T~SMTC\_MAX~ + T~rs~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ measure~
+ T~L1-RSRP,report~ + T~HARQ~ + max(T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + T~FineTiming~
+ 2 ms, T~uncertainty\_SP~), if semi-persistent CSI-RS is used for CSI
reporting,

\- 3 ms + T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + T~SMTC\_MAX~ + T~rs~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ measure~
+ T~L1-RSRP,report~ + max(T~HARQ~ + T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + 5 ms +
T~FineTiming~, T~uncertainty\_RRC~ + T~RRC\_delay~), if periodic CSI-RS
is used for CSI reporting.

\- However,Â whenÂ the following conditions are fulfilled,Â no activation
requirement will be applied for this unknownÂ SCell:

\- the SCell is contiguous to an active serving cell in the same band,
and

\- A single SSB is used in the unknown SCell; or multiple SSBs are used
in the SCell and TCI state indication for PDCCH is provided by the same
MAC PDU used for SCell activation; and

\- its *ssb-PositionInBurst* is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active
serving cell, and

> \- its SMTC offset is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active serving
> cell
>
> \- its RTD with contiguous FR1 active serving cell is larger than 260
> ns, or its reception power difference with contiguous FR1 active
> serving cell is larger than *6 dB*;
>
> If the SCell being activated belongs to FR1 and if there is at least
> one active serving cell contiguous to the SCell on that FR1 band, if
> the UE is not provided with SSB configuration (*absoluteFrequencySSB*)
> or SMTC configuration for the target SCell, T~activation\_time~ is 3
> ms for UE supporting *scellWithoutSSB*, provided

\- The RTD between the target SCell and the contiguous active serving
cell is within Â±260ns, and

\- The difference of the reception power with the contiguous active
serving cell is \<= 6 dB, and

\- The RS(s) of SCell being activated is (are) QCL-TypeA with TRS(s) of
the SCell being activated, and the TRS(s) of the SCell being activated
is (are) further QCL-TypeC with SSB(s) of any active serving cell that
is contiguous to the SCell being activated on that FR1 band.

For a UE supporting *scellWithoutSSB-InterBandCA-r18* if the SCell being
activated belongs to FR1 and if the UE is not provided with SSB
configuration (*absoluteFrequencySSB*) in the target SCell
(FrequencyInfoDL) nor SMTC configuration for the target SCell, and if
there is one collocated active reference serving cell on different FR1
band, when the following conditions are fulfilled,

\- The RTD between the target SCell and the collocated reference serving
cell is within CP where CP is corresponding to the SCS of SSB-less
SCell, and

\- The EPRE difference at the UE is smaller than or equal to 30 dB,
where EPRE difference is the power difference between TRS/A-TRS symbol
on the SSB-less SCell and SSB symbol on the reference serving cell
normalized by SCSs of SSB of reference cell and A-TRS/P-TRS of SSB-less
SCell, and

\- The RS(s) of the SSB-less SCell being activated is (are) QCL-TypeA
with TRS(s) of the SSB-less SCell being activated, and the TRS(s) of the
SSB-less SCell being activated is (are) further QCL-TypeC with SSB(s) of
an inter-band active serving cell, and the inter-band active serving
cell shall be same as the reference serving cell.

where the reference serving cell can be indicated by higherlayer
parameter *referenceCell-r18*. If UE is not indicated with
*referenceCell-r18*, the reference serving cell is assumed to be the
QCL-typeC source cell if there is only one active QCL-typeC source cell
configured.

T~activation\_time~ is

\- T~first\_TRS~ + T~TRS~ +5 ms, if aperiodic CSI-RS resources are not

*aperiodicCSI-RS-FastScellActivation-r17, when the* the EPRE difference
is smaller than or equal to 12 dB

\- T~first\_ATRS~ + T~gap~ + T~ATRS~ + 5 ms if aperiodic CSI-RS
resources are configured for SCell activation for UE supporting
*aperiodicCSI-RS-FastScellActivation-r17, when the* the EPRE difference
is smaller than or equal to 12 dB

\- T~first\_TRS~ + 2\*T~TRS~ +5 ms, *when* the EPRE difference is larger
than 12 dB but smaller than or equal to 30 dB

For a UE supporting *scellWithoutSSB-InterBandCA-r18*, when UE receive
SCell activation command for more than one SSB-less SCell, the SCell
activation delay for each of the to-be-activated SSB-less SCell in FR1

\- SSB-less SCells being activated are on different bands, or

\- all SCells being activated are SSB-less SCells, the SCells are
contiguous on the same band, and all to-be-activated SCells have the
same QCL-typeC QCL source cell.

If the SCell being activated belongs to FR2 and if there is at least one
active serving cell on that FR2 band, then T~activation\_time~ is

\- the SSBs in the serving cell(s) and the SSBs in the SCell fulfil the
condition defined in clauseÂ 3.6.3, and

\- the parameter ssb-PositionsInBurst is same for the serving cell(s)
and the SCell, and

\- SSB is in the same half-frame on the SCell and the contiguous FR2
active serving cell.

If the SCell being activated belongs to FR2 and if there is at least one
active serving cell on that FR2 band, if the UE supporting
*scellWithoutSSB* is not provided with any SMTC for the target SCell,
T~activation\_time~ is 3Â ms, provided

\- the RS (s) of SCell being activated is (are) QCL-TypeD with RS (s) of
one active serving cell on that FR2 band.

\- the RS (s) of SCell being activated is (are) QCL-TypeD with RS (s) of
one active serving cell on that FR2 band.

serving cell on that FR2 band provided that PCell or PSCell is in FR1 or
in FR2:

If the target SCell is known to UE and semi-persistent CSI-RS is used
for CSI reporting, then T~activation\_time~ is:

\- 3 ms + max(T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + T~FineTiming~ + 2 ms,
T~uncertainty\_SP~), where T~uncertainty\_MAC~=0 and
T~uncertainty\_SP~=0 if

\- UE receives the SCell activation command, semi-persistent CSI-RS
activation command and TCI state activation command at the same time, or

\- Provided this is the initial activation after SCell addition, and

during the cell detection time for unknown SCell activation.

When *absoluteFrequencySSB* is not configured in *DownlinkConfigCommon*
for target SCell but SMTC for target SCell is configured, no requirement
would be applied.

T~CSI\_reporting~ is the delay (in ms) including uncertainty in
acquiring the first available downlink CSI reference resource, UE
processing time for CSI reporting and uncertainty in acquiring the first
available CSI reporting resources as specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

FR1 before the reception of the SCell activation command:

\- the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the SCell being
activated and

\- the SSB measured remains detectable according to the cell
identification conditions specified in clause 9.2 and 9.3.

\- the SSB measured during the period equal to max(5\*measCycleSCell,
5\*DRX cycles) also remains detectable during the SCell activation delay
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clause 9.2
and 9.3.

Otherwise SCell in FR1 is unknown.

For the first SCell activation in FR2 bands, the SCell is known if it
has been meeting the following conditions:

\- During the period equal to 4 s for UE supporting power class 1/5 and
3 s for UE supporting power class 2/3/4 before UE receives the last

unknown SCell applies provided that the activation commands for PDCCH
TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable), semi-persistent CSI-RS for CQI
reporting (when applicable), and configuration message for TCI of
periodic CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable) are based on the
latest valid L1-RSRP reporting.

If the UE has been provided with higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\]
signalling of *smtc2* prior to the activation command, T~SMTC\_Scell~
follows *smtc1* or *smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the
target cell being activated. T~SMTC\_MAX~ follows *smtc1* or *smtc2*
according to the physical cell IDs of the target cells being activated
and the active serving cells.

In addition to CSI reporting defined above, UE shall also apply other
actions related to the activation command specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\]
for a SCell at the first opportunities for the corresponding actions
once the SCell is activated.

The starting point of an interruption window on SpCell or any activated
SCell, as specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot

where T~activation\_time~ includes T~first\_TRS~;

\- T~first\_ATRS~, for FR1 inter-band SSB-less SCell activation scenario
where T~activation\_time~ includes T~first\_ATRS~.

The length of the interruption window may be different for different
victim cells, and depends on the applicable scenario and on the
frequency band relation between the aggressor cell and the victim cell.

The requirements in this clause and requirements on interruption due to
SCell activation in clause 8.2 apply provided that the SSB of the
to-be-activated SCell is within the first active DL BWP of the SCell.

Starting from the slot specified in clause 4.3 of TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]
(timing for secondary Cell activation/deactivation) and until the UE has
completed the SCell activation, the UE shall report out of range if the
UE has available uplink resources to report CQI for the SCell.

SCell, as specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot
n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$ and not occur
after slot n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$,
where NR slot length is with respect to the numerology used in the SCell
being deactivated.

Upon expiry of the *sCellDeactivationTimer* in slot *n*, the UE shall
accomplish the deactivation actions for the SCell being deactivated no
later than in slot *n +*$\ \frac{3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$. The
starting point of an interruption window on SpCell or any activated

The requirements in this clause apply for UE being configured in the RRC
reconfiguration message, TS 38.331 \[2\], with one SCell for which the
parameter *sCellState* is set to *activated*. If the RRC reconfiguration

38.213 \[3\]) and until the SCell activation completion at UE, after at
least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for the channel measurement and
reporting (specified in clause 5.2.2.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\]), the UE
shall report out of range if the UE has available uplink resources to
report CQI for the SCell.

### 8.3.17 SCell Activation Delay Requirement for Deactivated SCell with the L3 reporting during activation

The requirements in this clause shall apply for UE supporting
*l3-MeasUnknownSCellActivation-r18* and is configured with
*ReportOnScellActivation* and reporting valid L3 measurement results
after receiving the SCell activation command for unknown SCell. The
requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with one
downlink SCell in EN-DC, or in standalone NR carrier aggregation or in
NE-DC or in NR-DC and when one SCell is being activated. Clause 8.3.2 is
applied for UE who does not report L3 measurement results after
receiving SCell activation command for unknown SCell.

The delay within which the UE shall be able to activate the deactivated
SCell depends upon the specified conditions.

Upon receiving SCell activation command in slot *n*, the UE shall be
capable to transmit valid CSI report and apply actions related toÂ the
activation command for the SCell being activated no later than in slot
$n + \frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + T_{activation\_ time} + T_{CSI\_ Reporting}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$
, where:

T~HARQ~ (in ms) is the timing between DL data transmission and
acknowledgement as specified in TSÂ 38.213 \[3\]

T~activation\_time~ is the SCell activation delay in milliseconds.

\- T~activation\_time~ is:

\- 10 ms + T~L3,report~+ T~HARQ~ + max(T~uncertainty\_MAC~ +
T~FineTiming~ + 2 ms, T~uncertainty\_SP~), if semi-persistent CSI-RS is
used for CSI reporting,

\- 7 ms + T~L3,report~+ max(T~HARQ~ + T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + 5 ms +
T~FineTiming~, T~uncertainty\_RRC~ + T~RRC\_delay~), if periodic CSI-RS
is used for CSI reporting,

If the following conditions are met:

If the SCell being activated belongs to FR1 and if there is no active
serving cell contiguous to the SCell on that FR1 band provided that the
side condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB is fulfilled:

If the target SCell belongs to FR1 and none of the following conditions
is met

\- 'ssb-PositionInBurst' indicates only one SSB is being actually
transmitted, or

\- 'ssb-PositionInBurst' indicates multiple SSBs and TCI indication is
provided in same MAC PDU with SCell activation;

If the SCell being activated belongs to FR2-1 and if there is no active
serving cell on that FR2-1 band provided that PCell or PSCell is in FR1
or in FR2-1:

If the PCell/PSCell and the target SCell are configured as FR1-FR2-1 CA
or if the PCell/PSCell and the target SCell are in a FR2-1 band pair
with independent beam management, and the target SCell is unknown to UE
provided that the side condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB is fulfilled.

> Otherwise, T~activation\_time~ in clause 8.3.2 is applied for unknown
> SCell activation.

However,Â whenÂ the following conditions are fulfilled,Â no activation
requirement will be applied for this unknownÂ SCell:

\- the SCell is contiguous to an active serving cell in the same band,
and

\- a single SSB is used in the unknown SCell; or multiple SSBs are used
in the SCell and TCI state indication for PDCCH is provided by the same
MAC PDU used for SCell activation; and

\- its *ssb-PositionInBurst* is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active
serving cell, and

\- its SMTC offset is same as the one of contiguous FR1 active serving
cell

\- its RTD with contiguous FR1 active serving cell is larger than 260 ns
with respect to the to-be-activated SCell's SSB numerology, or its
reception power difference with contiguous FR1 active serving cell is
larger than *6 dB*;

where,

T~L3,\ report~ is delay of acquiring the first available UL resource for
L3 reporting from 7 ms +T~HARQ~ after receiving SCell activation
command.

\- The L3 measurement reporting requirement is defined in clause 9.2.4.4

\- UE is ready to report the L3 measurement result no later than 7 ms +
T~HARQ~ ms from receiving the SCell activation command.

UE is not required to report the L3 results after 3 ms + T~HARQ~+ M ms
from receiving the SCell activation command where

\- For FR1,

> \- M= 2\*T~SSB~ + T~L1-RSRP,report~ for UE supporting
> *shortMeasInterval-r18* capability~,~
>
> \- Otherwise, M = T~SMTC~ +T~SSB~ + T~L1-RSRP,report~

\- For FR2-1,

\- M= (X1+X2)\*T~SSB~ + T~L1-RSRP,report~ for UE supporting
*reduceForCellDetection* and/or *reduceForSSB-L1-RSRP-Meas* and
*shortMeasInterval-r18* capability~,~

\- M = X1\*T~SMTC~ +X2\*T~SSB~ + T~L1-RSRP,report~ for UE supporting
*reduceForCellDetection* and/or *reduceForSSB-L1-RSRP-Meas* without
supporting *shortMeasInterval-r18* capability~,~

\- M = 16\*T~SSB~ + T~L1-RSRP,report~ for UE supporting
*shortMeasInterval-r18* without supporting *reduceForCellDetection* and
*reduceForSSB-L1-RSRP-Meas* capability,

\- Otherwise, M = 8\*T~SMTC~ +8\*T~SSB~ + T~L1-RSRP,report~

Where, X1 and X2 are UE capabilities as reported in
*reduceForCellDetection* and *reduceForSSB-L1-RSRP-Meas* respectively.
T~SSB~ is the same as T~rs,\ enhanced~ as specified in clause 8.3.2.
T~SMTC~ is the same as T~SMTC\_MAX~ as specified in clause 8.3.2.

T~FineTiming~ is the time period between UE finish processing the last
activation command for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable) and the
timing of first complete available SSB corresponding to the TCI state.

T~uncertainty\_MAC~ is the time period between reception of the last
activation command for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable) relative
to

> \- First valid L3-RSRP reporting for unknown case, if UE reports valid
> L3-RSRP before receiving TCI activation command
>
> \- First valid L1-RSRP reporting for unknown case, if UE reports valid
> L3-RSRP after receiving TCI activation command

T~uncertainty\_RRC~ is the time period between reception of the RRC
configuration message for TCI of periodic CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when
applicable) relative to

\- First valid L3-RSRP reporting for unknown case, if UE reports valid
L3-RSRP before receiving TCI activation command

\- First valid L1-RSRP reporting for unknown case, if UE reports valid
L3-RSRP after receiving TCI activation command

T~uncertainty\_SP~ is the time period between reception of the
activation command for semi-persistent CSI-RS resource set for CQI
reporting relative to

\- First valid L3-RSRP reporting for unknown case, if UE reports valid
L3-RSRP before receiving TCI activation command

\- First valid L1-RSRP reporting for unknown case, if UE reports valid
L3-RSRP after receiving TCI activation command

T~RRC\_delay~ is the RRC procedure delay as specified in TS 38.331
\[2\].

Longer delays for RRM measurement requirements, and in case of FR2-1
also SSB based RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement requirements, can be
expected during the cell detection time for unknown SCell activation.

When *absoluteFrequencySSB* is not configured in *DownlinkConfigCommon*
for target SCell but SMTC for target SCell is configured, no requirement
would be applied.

T~CSI\_reporting~ is the delay (in ms) including uncertainty in
acquiring the first available downlink CSI reference resource, UE
processing time for CSI reporting and uncertainty in acquiring the first
available CSI reporting resources as specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

SCell in FR1 is known if it has been meeting the following conditions:

\- During the period equal to max(5\*measCycleSCell, Â 5\*DRX cycles) for
FR1 before the reception of the SCell activation command:

\- the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the SCell being
activated and

\- the SSB measured remains detectable according to the cell
identification conditions specified in clause 9.2 and 9.3.

\- the SSB measured during the period equal to max(5\*measCycleSCell,
5\*DRX cycles) also remains detectable during the SCell activation delay
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2
and 9.3.

Otherwise SCell in FR1 is unknown.

For the first SCell activation in FR2-1 bands, the SCell is known if it
has been meeting the following conditions:

\- During the period equal to 4 s for UE supporting power class 1/5 and
3 s for UE supporting power class 2/3/4 before UE receives the last
activation command for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable) and
semi-persistent CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable):

\- the UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index,
and

\- SCell activation command is received after L3-RSRP reporting and no
later than the time when UE receives MAC-CE command for TCI activation

\- During the period from L3-RSRP reporting to the valid CQI reporting,
the reported SSBs with indexes remain detectable according to the cell
identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2 and 9.3, and the TCI
state is selected based on one of the latest reported SSB indexes.

Otherwise, the first SCell in FR2-1 band is unknown.

The requirement for unknown SCell applies provided that the activation
commands for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable), semi-persistent
CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable), and configuration message
for TCI of periodic CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable) are based
on either L1-RSRP or L3-RSRP if any one of them is reported before
receiving TCI activation command.

If the UE has been provided with higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\]
signaling of *smtc2* prior to the activation command, T~SMTC\_Scell~
follows *smtc1* or *smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the
target cell being activated. T~SMTC\_MAX~ follows *smtc1* or *smtc2*
according to the physical cell IDs of the target cells being activated
and the active serving cells.

In addition to CSI reporting defined above, UE shall also apply other
actions related to the activation command specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\]
for a SCell at the first opportunities for the corresponding actions
once the SCell is activated.

The starting point of an interruption window on SpCell or any activated
SCell, as specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot
n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$ and not occur
after slot slot
n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3ms + T_{X}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$,
where NR slot length is with respect to the numerology used in the SCell
being activated, and T~X~ is:

\- T~uncertainty\_MAC~ +T~FineTiming~, for any scenario where
T~activation\_time~ includes only T~FineTiming~ and no T~FirstSSB\_MAX.~

The length of the interruption window may be different for different
victim cells, and depends on the applicable scenario and on the
frequency band relation between the aggressor cell and the victim cell.

The requirements in this clause and requriements on interruption due to
SCell activation in clause 8.2 apply provided that the SSB of the
to-be-activated SCell is within the first active DL BWP of the Scell.

Starting from the slot specified in clause 4.3 of TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]
(timing for secondary Cell activation/deactivation) and until the UE has
completed the SCell activation, the UE shall report out of range if the
UE has available uplink resources to report CQI for the SCell.

Starting from the slot specified in clause 4.3 of TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]
(timing for secondary Cell activation/deactivation) and until the UE has
completed a first L1-RSRP measurement, the UE shall report lowest valid
L1 SS-RSRP range if the UE has available uplink resources to report
L1-RSRP for the SCell.

8.3A SCell Activation and Deactivation Delay in Carriers with CCA
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.3A.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall
be able to activate a deactivated SCell operating with CCA and
deactivate an activated SCell operating with CCA in EN-DC or in
standalone NR carrier aggregation.

In the requirements of clause 8.3A, the term SMTC occasion not available
at the UE refers to when the SMTC contains SSBs configured by gNB in a
cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but the first two successive
candidate SSB positions for the same SSB index within the discovery
burst transmission window are not available at the UE due to DL CCA
failures at gNB during the corresponding period; otherwise the SMTC
occasion is considered as available at the UE.

In the requirements of clause 8.3A, the term CSI-RS occasion not
available at the UE due to DL CCA failures referes to when the CSI-RS is
configured by gNB for the UE but not available at the UE due to DL CCA
failures at gNB during the corresponding period.

The requirements shall apply for EN-DC and standalone NR carrier
aggregation.

### 8.3A.2 SCell Activation Delay Requirement for Deactivated SCell

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
at least one downlink SCell operating with CCA in EN-DC or in standalone
NR carrier aggregation and when one SCell operating with CCA is being
activated but none of the RRC parameters *CO-DurationPerCell-r16*,
*SlotFormatIndicator*, and *CSI-RS-ValidationWith-DCI-r16* is configured
**and all of the CSI reporting resources for being-activated SCell are
available**.

The delay within which the UE shall be able to activate the deactivated
SCell depends upon the specified conditions.

Upon receiving SCell activation command in slot *n*, the UE shall be
capable to transmit valid CSI report and apply actions related toÂ the
activation command for the SCell being activated no later than in slot n
+ (T~HARQ~ + T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ +
T~CSI\_reporting\_withCCA~)/*NR\_slot\_length*, where:

\- T~HARQ~ (in ms) is the timing between DL data transmission and
acknowledgement as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\]. In the event of UE not
being able to transmit the acknowledgment due to UL CCA failures:
T~HARQ~ is extended to also include the time to all next HARQ feedback
transmission and retransmission opportunities, until the time of its
successful transmission, as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\]; no extension
of T~HARQ~ due to UL CCA failures is allowed for Type 2C UL channel
access procedure as defined in TS 37.213 \[33\].

\- T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ is the SCell activation delay in
milliseconds.

\- If the SCell is known and belongs to FR1,
T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ is:

\- T~FirstSSB~ + L~1~\*T~rs~ + 5 ms, if the measurement period of the
SCell being activated is equal to or smaller than 2400 ms.

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + L~2,1~\*T~SMTC\_MAX~ + (1 +L~2,2~)\*T~rs~ + 5 ms,
if the measurement period of the SCell being activated is larger than
2400 ms.

\- If the SCell is unknown and belongs to FR1, provided that the side
condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB is fulfilled and the SCell can be successfully
detected in one attempt, T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ is:

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + (1 + L~3,1~)\*T~SMTC\_MAX~ + (2 + L~3,2~)\*T~rs~ +
5 ms.

\- If the SCell being activated belongs to FR2-2 and if there is at
least one active serving cell on that FR2-2 band, if the UE supporting
*scellWithoutSSB* is not provided with any SMTC for the target SCell,
T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ is 3Â ms, provided

\- the RS (s) of SCell being activated is (are) QCL-TypeD with RS (s) of
one active serving cell on that FR2-2 band.

\- If the SCell being activated belongs to FR2-2 and if there is no
active serving cell on that FR2-2 band provided that PCell or PSCell is
in FR1 or in FR2-2:

\- If the target SCell is known to UE and semi-persistent CSI-RS is used
for CSI reporting, then T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ is:

\- 3 ms + max(T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + T~FineTiming~ + 2 ms,
T~uncertainty\_SP~), where T~uncertainty\_MAC~=0 and
T~uncertainty\_SP~=0 if:

\- UE receives the SCell activation command, semi-persistent CSI-RS
activation command and TCI state activation command at the same time, or

\- Provided this is the initial activation after SCell addition, and

> \- TCI-ActivatedConfig is configured for the SCell, and UE receives
> the SCell activation command and semi-persistent CSI-RS activation
> command at the same time.

\- If the target SCell is known to UE and periodic CSI-RS is used for
CSI reporting, then T~activation\_time~ is:

\- max(T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + 5 ms + T~FineTiming~, T~uncertainty\_RRC~ +
T~RRC\_delay~-T~HARQ~), where T~uncertainty\_MAC~=0 if

\- UE receives the SCell activation command and TCI state activation
commands at the same time, or

\- Provided this is the initial activation after SCell addition, and

\- UE receives the SCell activation command and TCI-ActivatedConfig is
configured for the SCell.

\- If the PCell/PSCell and the target SCell are configured as FR1-FR2-2
CA or if the PCell/PSCell and the target SCell are in a FR2-2 band pair
with independent beam management, and the target SCell is unknown to UE
and semi-persistent CSI-RS is used for CSI reporting, provided that the
side condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB is fulfilled, then
T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ is:

\- 6 ms + T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + (23+N\*L~4,1~)\*T~SMTC\_MAX~ + (12+N
\*L~4,2~)\*T~rs~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ measure~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ report~ + T~HARQ~
+ max(T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + T~FineTiming~ + 2 ms, T~uncertainty\_SP~).

\- If the PCell/PSCell and the target SCell are configured as FR1-FR2-2
CA or if the PCell/PSCell and the target SCell are in a FR2-2 band pair
with independent beam management, and the target SCell is unknown to UE
and periodic CSI-RS is used for CSI reporting, provided that the side
condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB is fulfilled, then T~activation\_time\_withCCA~
is:

\- 3 ms + T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + (23+N\*L~5,1~)\*T~SMTC\_MAX~ + (12+N
\*L~5,2~)\*T~rs~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ measure~ + T~L1-RSRP,\ report~ + max
{(T~HARQ~ + T~uncertainty\_MAC~ + 5 ms + T~FineTiming~),
(T~uncertainty\_RRC~ + T~RRC\_delay~)}.

Where,

T~SMTC\_MAX~:

\- In case of intra-band SCell activation, T~SMTC\_MAX~ is the longest
SMTC periodicity between active serving cells and SCell being activated

been provided with an SMTC configuration for the SCell in SCell addition
message, otherwise T~rs~ is the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR
having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing. If the UE is not
provided SMTC configuration or measurement object on this frequency, the
requirement which involves T~rs~ is applied with T~rs~ = 5 ms assuming
the SSB transmission periodicity is 5 ms. There are no requirements if
the SSB transmission periodicity is not 5 ms

T~FirstSSB~: is the time to the end of the first complete configured SSB
burst indicated by the SMTC after slot n + (T~HARQ~+3
ms)/*NR\_slot\_length*

T~FirstSSB\_MAX~: is the time to the end of first complete configured
SSB burst indicated by the SMTC after slot n + (T~HARQ~+3
ms)/*NR\_slot\_length* when all active serving cells and SCells being
activated or released have configured SSB bursts in the same slot for
intra-band scenario. In case of inter-band SCell activation,
T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ is the time to the end of the first complete configured
SSB burst of the SCell being activated. In FR2-2, the occasion when all
active serving cells and SCells being activated or released are
transmitting SSB bursts in the same slot.

L~1~ (L~1~ â‰¤ L~1,max~) is the number of configured SMTC occasions not
available at the UE. L~1,max~ = 2 if T~rs~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise L~1,max~ =

in any of the SCells already activated or being activated provided their
cell specific reference signals are configured in the same slot, for
intra-band scenario

and L~2,1,max~ = 2 if T~SMTC\_MAX~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise L~2,1,max~ = 1.
L~3,1,max~ = 2 if T~SMTC\_MAX~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise L~3,1,max~ = 1.

L~2,2~ (L~2,2~ â‰¤ L~2,2,max~) and L~3,2~ (L~3,2~ â‰¤ L~3,2,max~) are the
number of configured SMTC occasions not available at the UE in the SCell
being activated. L~2,2,max~ = 2 if T~rs~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise L~2,2,max~ =
1. L~3,2,max~ = 2 if T~rs~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise L~3,2,max~ = 1.

N = 12 for an FR2-2 unknown SCell activation.

L~4,1~ (L~4,1~ â‰¤ L~4,1,max~) and L~5,1~ (L~5,1~ â‰¤ L~5,1,max~) are the
numbers of SMTC occasions groups not available at the UE, for an FR2-2
unknown SCell activation,

in the SCell being activated, for inter-band scenario, or

in any of the SCells already activated or being activated provided their
cell specific reference signals are configured in the same slot, for
intra-band scenario

and L~4,1,max~ = 2 if T~SMTC\_MAX~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise L~4,1,max~ = 1.
L~5,1,max~ = 2 if T~SMTC\_MAX~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise L~5,1,max~ = 1.

L~4,2~ (L~4,2~ â‰¤ L~4,2,max~) and L~5,2~ (L~5,2~ â‰¤ L~5,2,max~) are the
number of SMTC occasions groups not available at the UE in the FR2-2
unknown SCell being activated. L~4,2,max~ = 2 if T~rs~ â‰¤ 40 ms;
otherwise L~4,2,max~ = 1. L~5,2,max~ = 2 if T~rs~ â‰¤ 40 ms; otherwise
L~5,2,max~ = 1.

T~FineTiming~ is the time period between UE finish processing the last
activation command for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable) and the
timing of first complete available SSB corresponding to the TCI state.

T~L1-RSRP,\ measure~ is L1-RSRP measurement delay
T~L1-RSRP\_Measurement\_Period\_SSB\_CCA~ ms as defined in clause
9.5A.4.1 with the assumption of M=1.

configuration message for TCI of periodic CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when
applicable) relative to

\- SCell activation command for known case;

\- First valid L1-RSRP reporting for unknown case.

T~uncertainty\_SP~ is the time period between reception of the
activation command for semi-persistent CSI-RS resource set for CQI
reporting relative to

\- SCell activation command for known case;

\- First valid L1-RSRP reporting for unknown case.

T~RRC\_delay~ is the RRC procedure delay as specified in TS 38.331
\[2\].

Longer delays for RRM measurement requirements, and in case of FR2-2
also SSB based RLM/BFD/CBD/L1-RSRP measurement requirements, can be
expected during the cell detection time for unknown SCell activation.

When *absoluteFrequencySSB* is not configured in *DownlinkConfigCommon*
for target SCell but SMTC for target SCell is configured, no
requirements apply.

T~CSI\_reporting\_withCCA~ = T~CSI\_reporting~ +
T~CSI\_ReportingDelay\ ,~ where

T~CSI\_reporting~ is the delay (in ms) including uncertainty in
acquiring the first available downlink CSI reference resource, UE
processing time for CSI reporting and uncertainty in acquiring the first
available CSI reporting resources as specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

T~CSI\_ReportingDelay~ is the additional delay in transmission of CSI
reporting due to UL CCA failures at the UE. If there are no uplink
resources for reporting the valid CSI, then the UE shall use the next
available opportunities for reporting the corresponding valid CSI as
specified in TS 38.213 \[3\].

Upon exceeding any of the maximum numbers L~1,max~, L~2,1,max~,
L~2,2,max~, L~3,1,max~, and L~3,2,max~ of SMTC occasions or CSI-RS
occasions, respectively, not available at the UE, the UE shall abandon
the SCell activation procedure.

SCell operating with CCA in FR1 is known if it has been meeting the
following conditions:

\- During the period equal to max(5 measCycleSCell, Â 5 DRX cycles)
before the reception of the SCell activation command:

\- the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the SCell being
activated and

\- the SSB measured remains detectable in the SMTC occasions available
at the UE, according to the cell identification conditions specified in
clause 9.2A and 9.3A.

\- the SSB measured during the period equal to max(5 measCycleSCell, 5
DRX cycles) also remains detectable - the SSB measured during the period
equal to max(5 measCycleSCell, 5 DRX cycles) also remains detectable in
the SMTC occasions available at the UE during the SCell activation delay
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clause 9.2A
and 9.3A.

Otherwise SCell operating with CCA in FR1 is unknown.

For the first SCell activation with CCA in FR2-2 bands, the SCell is
known if it has been meeting the following conditions:

\- During the period equal to 4 s for UE supporting power class 1/5 and
3 s for UE supporting power class 2/3/4 before UE receives the last
activation command for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable) and
semi-persistent CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable):

\- the UE has sent a valid L3-RSRP measurement report with SSB index

\- SCell activation command is received after L3-RSRP reporting and no
later than the time when UE receives MAC-CE command for TCI activation

\- During the period from L3-RSRP reporting to the valid CQI reporting,
the reported SSBs with indexes remain detectable according to the cell
identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2 and 9.3, and the TCI
state is selected based on one of the latest reported SSB indexes.

Otherwise, the first SCell with CCA in FR2-2 band is unknown. The
requirement for unknown SCell applies provided that the activation
commands for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable), semi-persistent
CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable), and configuration message
for TCI of periodic CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable) are based
on the latest valid L1-RSRP reporting.

If the UE has been provided with higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\]
signalling of *smtc2* prior to the activation command, T~SMTC\_Scell~
follows *smtc1* or *smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the
target cell being activated. T~SMTC\_MAX~ follows *smtc1* or *smtc2*
according to the physical cell IDs of the target cells being activated
and the active serving cells.

In addition to CSI reporting defined above, UE shall also apply other
actions related to the activation command specified in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\]
for a SCell at the first opportunities for the corresponding actions
once the SCell is activated.

For intra-band CA, the starting point of an interruption window on
SpCell or any activated SCell as specified in clause 8.2, shall not
occur before slot n+1+
$\frac{\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{\text{HARQ}}}}{\mathbf{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}}$
and not occur after slot
n+1+$\frac{\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{\text{HARQ}}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{3 + T}_{\mathbf{X}}}{\mathbf{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}}$
, where T~X~ is:

\- T~FirstSSB~, for known SCell activation when SCell measurement cycle
is equal to or smaller than 160 ms;

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + L~2,1~\* T~SMTC\_MAX~ for known SCell activation
when SCell measurement cycle is greater than 160 ms;

\- T~FirstSSB\_MAX~ + L~3,1~\* T~SMTC\_MAX~ for unknown SCell activation

For inter-band CA, the starting point of an interruption window on
SpCell or any activated SCell as specified in clause 8.2, shall not
occur before slot n+1+
$\frac{\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{\text{HARQ}}}}{\mathbf{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}}$
and not occur after slot
n+1+$\frac{\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{\text{HARQ}}}\mathbf{+}\mathbf{3 + T}_{\mathbf{X}}}{\mathbf{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}}$
, where T~X~ is:

\- T~FirstSSB~, for known SCell activation when SCell measurement cycle
is equal to, or smaller than, 160 ms.

For intra-band CA,

\- While the SCell being activated is known with measurement cycle equal
to or smaller than 160 ms, no more than one interruption is allowed
during SCell activation.

\- While the SCell being activated is known with measurement cycle
greater than 160 ms, up to 1+L~2,1~ interruptions are allowed during
SCell activation,

\- While the SCell being activated is unknown, up to 1+L~3,1~
interruptions are allowed during SCell activation. When L~3,1~\>0,
performance degradation may be expected on any activated intra-band
victim cells during the SCell activation

\- For a single interruption (L=0), interruption window length at SCell
activation does not depend on DL CCA failures.

For inter-band CA,

\- For any active cell in the same band with the SCell being activated,
the interruption requirements (i.e. number of interruptions and starting
point of an interruption) for intra-band CA apply.

\- For any active cell outside the band with the SCell being activated,
a single interruption applies

The number of interruptions and length of each interruption window may
be different for different victim cells and depends on the applicable
scenario and on the frequency band relation between the aggressor cell
and the victim cell. For a single interruption (L=0), the interruption
window length at SCell activation does not depend on DL CCA failures.

Starting from slot *n* + T~HARQ~ + 3 ms where slot *n* is the slot where
SCell activation command is received (as specified in clause 4.3 of TS
38.213 \[3\]) and until the SCell activation completion at UE, after at
least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for the channel measurement and
reporting (specified in clause 5.2.2.5 of TS 38.214 \[26\]), the UE
shall report out of range if the UE has available uplink resources to
report CQI for the SCell.

Starting from the slot specified in clause 4.3 of TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]
(timing for secondary Cell activation/deactivation) and until the UE has
completed a first L1-RSRP measurement, the UE shall report lowest valid
L1 SS-RSRP range if the UE has available uplink resources to report
L1-RSRP for the SCell.

The requirements in this clause do not apply when
*sCellDeactivationTimer* \[2\] is not configured and when
T~activation\_time\_withCCA~ exceeds 1280 ms.

### 8.3A.3 SCell Deactivation Delay Requirement for Activated SCell

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
at least one downlink SCell operating with CCA in EN-DC or in standalone
NR carrier aggregation and one SCell is deactivated.

Upon receiving SCell deactivation command in slot *n*, the UE shall
accomplish the deactivation actions for the SCell being deactivated no
later than in slot *n+*(T~HARQ~ +3 ms)/*NR\_slot\_length*. The starting
point of an interruption window on SpCell or any activated SCell, as
specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot
n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$ and not occur
after slot n+1+$\frac{T_{\text{HARQ}} + 3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$,
where NR slot length is with respect to the numerology used in the SCell
being deactivated.

Upon expiry of the *sCellDeactivationTimer* in slot *n*, the UE shall
accomplish the deactivation actions for the SCell being deactivated no
later than in slot *n +*$\ \frac{3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$. The
starting point of an interruption window on SpCell or any activated
SCell, as specified in clause 8.2, shall not occur before slot n+1 and
not occur after slot n+1+$\ \frac{3ms}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$, where
NR slot length is with respect to the numerology used in the SCell being
deactivated. The length of the interruption window may be different for
different victim cells, and depends on the applicable scenario and on
the frequency band relation between the aggressor cell and the victim
cell.

The requirements in this clause do not apply when
*sCellDeactivationTimer* \[2\] is not configured and when SCell
deactivation delay exceeds 1280 ms.

8.4 UE UL carrier RRC reconfiguration delay
-------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for a UE being configured or
deconfigured with a supplementary UL carrier or NR UL carrier.

### 8.4.2 UE UL carrier configuration delay requirement

When the UE receives a RRC message implying NR UL or supplementary UL
carrier configuration, the UE shall be ready to start transmission on
the newly configured carrier within T~UL\_carrier\_config~ from the end
of slot n.

Where

\- Slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command.

\- T~UL\_carrier\_config~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay defined
in clause 11.2 in TS 36.331 \[16\] if the corresponding RRC message is
embedded in E-UTRA RRC message, otherwise it equals the maximum RRC
procedure delay defined in clause 12 in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

### 8.4.3 UE UL carrier deconfiguration delay requirement

When the UE receives a RRC message implying NR UL or supplementary UL
carrier deconfiguration RRC signalling, the UE shall stop UL signalling
on the deconfigured UL carrier within T~UL\_carrier\_deconfig~ from the
end of slot n.

Where

\- Slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command.

\- T~UL\_carrier\_deconfig~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay
defined in clause 11.2 in TS 36.331 \[16\] if the corresponding RRC
message is embedded in E-UTRA RRC message, otherwise it equals the
maximum RRC procedure delay defined in clause 12 in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

8.5 Link Recovery Procedures
----------------------------

### 8.5.1 Introduction

The UE shall assess the downlink radio link quality of a serving cell
based on the reference signal in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ as specified in
TS 38.213 \[3\] in order to detect beam failure on:

\- PCell in SA, NR-DC, or NE-DC operation mode,

\- PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode,

\- SCell in SA, NR-DC, NE-DC or EN-DC operation mode,

\- Deactivated PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode

The RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ *on PCell,
PSCell or deactivated PSCell (if configured* with *bfd-and-RLM* with
value *true)* can be periodic CSI-RS resources and/or SSBs. RS resource
configuration in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ on SCell shall be periodic
CSI-RS. A UE supporting *bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18* is
required to perform beam failure detection outside the active DL BWP,
provided the SSB is within the configured UE-specific CBW, in addition
to performing beam failure detection within the active DL BWP.
Otherwise, the UE is not required to perform beam failure detection
outside the active DL BWP. UE is not required to meet the requirements
in clauseÂ 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 if UE does not have set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$. UE is
not required to perform beam failure detection on a deactivated SCell,
and also not required to perform beam failure detection on resources
which is implicitly configured for a deactivated SCell. When more than 2
periodic CSI-RS resources on a CC are configured in the set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ for current SCell or implicitly configured in the set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ for other SCell, it is up to UE implementation to select
two of CSI-RS resources in active BWP in current CC to perform beam
failure detection. UE is not required to perform beam failure detection
on a SCell on which ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ *is not configured.*

On each RS resource configuration in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$, the UE
shall estimate the radio link quality and compare it to the threshold
Q~out\_LR~ for the purpose of accessing downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell beams.

When a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI
states and the UE is provided *sfnSchemePdcch* set to \'sfnSchemeA\' or
\'sfnSchemeB\', the UE shall estimate a single downlink radio link
quality to derive a single SNR and compare it to the single thresholds
Q~out\_LR~ for the purpose of accessing downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell beams. How to compute the single SNR based on two
active TCI states is up to UE implementation.

The threshold Q~out\_LR~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio level link of a given resource configuration on set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the
BLER~out~ = 10% block error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission.
For SSB based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ is derived based
on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table
8.5.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in table 8.5.3.1-1.

Upon request the UE shall deliver configuration indexes from the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$*as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] , to higher layers,* and
the corresponding L1-RSRP measurement provided that the measured L1-RSRP
is equal to or better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~, which is indicated
by higher layer parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The UE applies the
Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from an SSB. The
UE applies the Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained
for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power
with a value provided by higher layer parameter *powerControlOffsetSS*.
The RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ can be
periodic CSI-RS resources or SSBs or both SSB and CSI-RS resources. A UE
supporting *bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18* is required to perform
beam failure detection outside the active DL BWP, provided the SSB is
within the configured UE-specific CBW, in addition to performing beam
failure detection within the active DL BWP. Otherwise, the UE is not
required to perform candidate beam detection outside the active DL BWP.
UE is not required to perform candidate beam detection on a SCell on
which ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ *is not configured.*

For a deactivated SCG, the UE may be provided via an RRC reconfiguration
message with *tci-info* for PDCCH/PDSCH reception at the transition from
deactivated SCG to activated SCG while the SCG is deactivated. After the
reception of the RRC reconfiguration message the UE shall perform the
BFD on the PSCellof the deactivated SCG using the TCI states according
to *tci-info specified in* clause 6.3.2 in TS 38.331 \[2\]*.*

For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, the SSB and SMTC in this clause
applies for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB if it is not explicitly specified
otherwise. If SSB in the active DL BWP of serving cell *i* is NCD-SSB,
for serving cell *i* the requirements in clause 8.5 apply provided that
serving cell *i* is PCell or activated PSCell.

#### 8.5.1.1 Introduction of Requirement on Link Recovery Procedures for UE configured with relaxed measurement criteria

*F*or the UE supports *bfd-Relaxation-r17* and configured with dedicated
signalling *goodServingCellEvaluationBFD*, which is always configured to
the UE when the network enables BFD relaxation for the UE as specified
in TS 38.331\[2\], the relaxed requirements defined in clause 8.5.2.4
for SSB based beam failure detection and the relaxed requirements
defined in clause 8.5.3.4 for CSI-RS based beam failure detection are
allowed to apply to the relaxed BFD measurements on the serving cell
after fulfilling the following conditions:

\- for the serving cells in intra-band carrier aggregation configured
with SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on SpCell together with CSI-RS based
BFD on SCell, when

> \- the good serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2
> of TS 38.331 \[2\] is fulfilled for the serving cell based on the
> measurements that are configured for SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on
> SpCell together with CSI-RS based BFD on SCell in the intra-band
> carrier aggregation if the *lowMobilityEvaluationConnected* is not
> configured, or

\- the UE is also configured with *lowMobilityEvaluationConnected* and
both low mobility criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.1 of TS 38.331
\[2\] is fulfilled for a period of T~SearchDeltaP-Connected~ and good
serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331
\[2\] is fulfilled for the serving cell based on the measurements that
are configured for SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on SpCell together with
CSI-RS based BFD on SCell in the intra-band carrier aggregation.

\- for other serving cells, when

\- the good serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of
TS 38.331 \[2\] is fulfilled for the serving cell configured with BFD-RS
if the *lowMobilityEvaluationConnected* is not configured, or

\- the UE is also configured with *lowMobilityEvaluationConnected*, and
both low mobility criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.1 of TS 38.331
\[2\] is fulfilled for a period of T~SearchDeltaP-Connected~ and good
serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331
\[2\] is fulfilled for the serving cell configured with BFD-RS.

Otherwise, UE shall apply the requirements defined in clause 8.5.2.2 for
SSB based beam failure detection and the requirements defined in clause
8.5.3.2 for CSI-RS based beam failure detection. Note that when multiple
resources are configured on a serving cell for RLM or BFD evaluation,
the good serving cell quality critierion is considered as fulfilled for
the serving cell when any resource configured for the cell fulfills the
good serving defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331 \[2\].

The scenario and RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$
defined in clause 8.5.1 apply for this clause.

The UE is no longer allowed to relax BFD measurements and apply the
relaxed link recovery procedures provided that at least one of the
following conditions is met:

\- The timer *beamFailureDetectionTimer* is running.

\- No DRX is configured or configured DRX cycle is longer than 80 ms

NOTE: Applicability of DRX configuration follows TS 38.331 \[2\] clause
5.7.13.0.

### 8.5.2 Requirements for SSB based beam failure detection

#### 8.5.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSB
configured for beam failure detection is actually transmitted within the
UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.5.2.2 unless the UE supports *bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*,
provided that the SSB is within the configured UE-specific CBW. The
requirements in this clause could not be applicable if UE is required to
perform beam failure detection on more than 1 serving cell per band
unless otherwise specified. For UE supporting
*intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and ***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18***
is not provided for the configured FR1 intra-band non-contiguous CA, the
requirements in this clause apply when UE is required to perform beam
failure detection on no more than 2 serving cells per band if these 2
serving cells are in non-contiguous carriers, and no more than 1 serving
cell per band otherwise.

#### 8.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured SSB resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the
last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5.2.2-1 or
table 8.5.2.2-4 (deactivated PSCell) for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5.2.2-2 or
table 8.5.2.2-5 (deactivated PSCell) for FR2 with scaling factor N,
where

> \- N = *2, 4 or 6* for serving cell in FR2-1 for UE supporting
> *fastBeamSweepingMultiRx-r18* according to the conditions in clause
> 3.6.19,
>
> \- N=8 for other cases in FR2-1, and
>
> \- N=12 for FR2-2,

for FR2 power classes other than power class 6 or for FR2 power class 6
when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5.2.2-5
(deactivated PSCell) for FR2 with scaling factor N=8 for FR2-1 and N=12
for FR2-2, for FR2 power classes other than power class 6 or for FR2
class 6 when *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17* is not configured.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5.2.2-3 for FR2
power class 6 UE configured with *highSpeedMeasFlagFR2-r17*.

For a UE supporting \[*support for Case 1 requirements*\] and when
concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a UE
supporting \[*support for Case 2 requirements*\] and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGap-r17* or *\[musim-GapPreference-r17\]* or both
*concurrentMeasGap-r17* and *\[musim-GapPreference-r17\],* and when
concurrent gaps or periodic MUSIM gaps or both concurrent GAPs and
periodic MUSIM gaps are configured,

Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*\[support for Case 1 requirements\]* nor *\[support for Case 2
requirements\]* nor supporting *\[musim-GapPreference-r17\]* or when
neither of the above configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement
gaps, concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) and concurrent
measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s), and periodic MUSIM gaps,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the SSB.

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the SSB.

For FR2

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with GAPs and the BFD-RS resource
is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped
with GAP and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  xRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and
T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{Min(xRP,\text{\ T}_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SSB~ \<xRP)
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully
overlapped with GAP.

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS
resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~)
and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \<
xRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside GAP is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC
period among all CCs in the same FR2 band, given the SMTC offset of all
CCs in FR2 provided the same offset.

\- When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,

\- a BFD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if it overlaps a GAP occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG only is configured,

\- a BFD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier to
be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

> \- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG only, a BFD-RS resource or an
> SMTC occasion is only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the
> Pre-MG is activated.

\- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s)
or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, a BFD-RS
resource or an SMTC occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a GAP
occasion if the GAP occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8,
clause 9.1.12, clause 9.1.13, respectively.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet previous
conditionsFor either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation
period would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE
is requested to decode an NR CGI.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with SSB resource
occasion for beam failure detection, longer evaluation period would be
expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and if SSB resource occasions
for beam failure detection are fully overlapped with MUSIM gap(s), or
the union of MUSIM gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies for SSB based
beam failure detection.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 8.5.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB OFDM symbols used for BFD measurement fully or
partially overlap with CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for BFD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period
for SSB based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurementÂ on one CC is in the same or
adjacent OFDM symbol as SSB from cell with additional PCI for L1-RSRP
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period
for SSB based BFD is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurementÂ on one CC fully or partially
overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell
for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for BFD measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions on the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

#### 8.5.2.4 Minimum requirement of SSB based beam failure detection for UE fulfilling relaxed measurement criteria

This clause contains minimum requirements for SSB based relaxed beam
failure detection.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured SSB resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the
last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Relax~ period becomes worse than the
threshold Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Relax~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Relax~ is defined in table 8.5.2.4-1
for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Relax~ is defined in table 8.5.2.4-2
for FR2 with scaling factor N=8.

The value of P is defined in clause 8.5.2.2.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

### 8.5.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection

#### 8.5.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ of resource configurations for a serving cell,
provided that the CSI-RS resource(s) in set
![](./media/image2.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.21666666666666667in"}for beam failure detection are actually
transmitted within the UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation
period specified in clause 8.5.3.2. UE is not expected to perform beam
failure detection measurements on the CSI-RS configured for BFD if the
CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD when applicable, with the RS in the
active TCI state of any CORESET configured in the UE active BWP. The
requirements in this clause apply when UE is required to perform beam
failure detection on no more than 1 serving cell per band unless
otherwise specified. For UE supporting
*intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and ***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18***
is not provided for the configured FR1 intra-band non-contiguous CA, the
requirements in this clause apply when UE is required to perform beam
failure detection on no more than 2 serving cells per band if these 2
serving cells are in non-contiguous carriers, and no more than 1 serving
cell per band otherwise.

#### 8.5.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the CSI-RS resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.5.3.2-1 or
table 8.5.3.2-3 (deactivated PSCell) for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.5.3.2-2 or
table 8.5.3.2-4 (deactivated PSCell) for FR2 with N=1. The requirements
of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ apply provided that the CSI-RS for BFD is
not in a resource set configured with repetition ON. The requirements
shall not apply when the CSI-RS resource in the active TCI state of
CORESET is the same CSI-RS resource for BFD and the TCI state
information of the CSI-RS resource is not given, wherein the TCI state
information means QCL Type-D to SSB for L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with
repetition ON.

\- For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and when concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or
*\[musim-GapPreference-r17\]* or both *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and
*musim-GapPreference-r17,* and when concurrent gaps or periodic MUSIM
gaps or both concurrent GAPs and periodic MUSIM gaps are configured,

considered to be overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap occasion is

Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement
gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and starting at the beginning
of any BFD-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of BFD-RS resource occasions within the

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS.

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with
any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P = 1, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with GAP and also
not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when the BFD-RS
resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS resource is not
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< xRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC
period among all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of
all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

\- When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,

\- a BFD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if it overlaps a GAP occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG GAP only is configured,

\- a BFD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

\- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG only, a BFD-RS resource or an
SMTC occasion is only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the
Pre-MG is activated.

\- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s)
or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, a BFD-RS
resource or an SMTC occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a GAP
occasion if the GAP occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8,
clause 9.1.12, clause 9.1.13, respectively.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for BFD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
BFD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
BFD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with CSI-RS
resource occasion for beam failure detection, longer evaluation period
would be expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and if CSI-RS resource
occasions for beam failure detection are fully overlapped with MUSIM
gap(s), or the union of MUSIM gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies
for CSI-RS based beam failure detection.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 8.5.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS beam failure detection

The SSB mentioned in this clause can be associated with either the
serving cell PCI or a PCI different from serving cell PCI.

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for BFD measurement in the PRBs that overlap
with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement has same
SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement, the UE shall be able to perform
CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement has
different SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement, the UE shall be able to
perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions according to its
capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC or
different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for BFD measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS
based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.For
both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement fully or partially
overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell
for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap, UE is not required to receive CSI-RS for BFD
measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement fully or partially overlaps
with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell for
intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap, if CSI-RS and SSB have different SCS and UE
does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement and SSB. Longer
measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbour cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement and
SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for BFD measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for BFD measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource set
configured with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ and beam
failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement
without any restriction.

For FR2-1, when the first CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM
symbol as the second CSI-RS for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same serving cell according to the conditions in clause 3.6.19, the UE
supporting *schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18* is required to measure
both the first and the second CSI-RSs without measurement restrictions,
provided the following conditions are met:

\- Both CSI-RSs are not in any CSI-RS resource set with repetition ON,
and

\- One CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- the other CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- Resources of the active TCI states of the two PDSCHs, or QCL sources
of the default QCL assumption, or the active TCI state of PDSCH and QCL
source of the default QCL assumption have been reported as a resource
group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

#### 8.5.3.4 Minimum requirement of CSI-RS based beam failure detection for UE fulfilling relaxed measurement criteria 

This clause contains the minimum requirements for CSI-RS based relaxed
beam failure detection.

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the CSI-RS resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ is defined in table
8.5.3.4-1 for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS\_Relax~ is defined in table
8.5.3.4-2 for FR2 with N=1.

The values of P, M~BFD~ and P~BFD~ is defined in clause 8.5.3.2.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE is
requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The beam failure instance evaluation for the RS resources in set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ shall be performed as specified in clause 6 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be

### 8.5.5 Requirements for SSB based candidate beam detection

#### 8.5.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSBs
configured for candidate beam detection are actually transmitted within
UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.5.5.2 unless the UE supports *bwpOperationMeasWithoutInterrupt-r18*,
provided that the SSB is within the configured UE-specific CBW. The
requirements in this clause apply when UE is required to perform
candidate beam detection on no more than 1 serving cell per band unless
otherwise specified. For UE supporting
*intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided for the configured FR1
intra-band non-contiguous CA, the requirements in this clause apply when
UE is required to perform candidate beam detection on no more than 2
serving cells per band if these 2 serving cells are in non-contiguous
carriers, and no more than 1 serving cell per band otherwise.

#### 8.5.5.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured SSB resource in set
${\bar{q}}_{1}\ $estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ period
becomes better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~ provided SSB\_RP and SSB
ÃŠs/Iot are according to Annex table B.2.4.1 for a corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured SSB resources using the evaluation
period in table 8.5.5.2-1 and 8.5.5.2-2 corresponding to the non-DRX
mode, if the configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5.5.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5.5.2-2 for FR2
with scaling factor N, where

> \- N = *2, 4 or 6* for serving cell in FR2-1 if the UE supports
> *fastBeamSweepingMultiRx-r18* according to the conditions in clause
> 3.6.19,
>
> \- N=8 for other cases in FR2-1, and

\- N=12 for FR2-2.

\- For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and when concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or
*musim-GapPreference-r17* or both *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and
*musim-GapPreference-r17*, and when concurrent gaps or periodic MUSIM
gaps or both concurrent GAPs and periodic MUSIM gaps are configured,

\- an SSB resource occasion for candidate beam detection is not
considered to be overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap occasion is
dropped according to clauses 9.1.8 and 9.1.10,

\- P value for a CBD-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~\> 0

> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
> the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps or
> periodic MUSIM gap(s) or NCSGs and per-FR measurement gaps or NCSGs,
> and, in case of Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and
> per-FR measurement gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and
> starting at the beginning of any CBD-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CBD-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions, MUSIM gap
occasions or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CBD-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any non-dropped **GAP** occasion nor non-dropped
MUSIM gap occasion within the window W, and

\- N~available~ is the number of CBD-RS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any non-dropped **GAP** occasion nor non-dropped MUSIM
gap occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W, and

\- an SSB resource occasion for candidate beam detection is considered
to be overlapped with the MUSIM gap if it overlaps a MUSIM gap occasion,
and

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CBD-RS**.**

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.

Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* nor *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* nor
supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* or when neither of the above
configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement gaps, concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s), concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s), and periodic MUSIM gaps,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the SSB,

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with
any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with GAP and candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP
and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  xRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP
and T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{Min(xRP,T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully
overlapped with GAP

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \< xRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the CBD-RS resource outside gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present, T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows
*smtc1.* T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the
same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same
offset.

> \- When a measurement gap is configured and the measurement gap is not
> NCSG,
>
> \- a CBD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be
> overlapped with the GAP if it overlaps a measurement gap occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG is measurement gap only is configured,

\- a CBD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

\- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG only, an CBD-RS resource or an
SMTC occasion is only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the
Pre-MG is activated.

\- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s)
or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, a CBD-RS
resource or an SMTC occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a gap
occasion if the gap occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8,
clause 9.1.12, clause 9.1.13, respectively.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with SSB resource
occasion for candidate beam detection, longer evaluation period would be
expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and if SSB resource occasions
for candidate beam detection are fully overlapped with MUSIM gap(s), or
the union of MUSIM gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies for SSB based
candidate beam detection.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer CBD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The values of P~CBD~ used in table 8.5.5.2-1 and table 8.5.5.2-2 are
defined as

> For each SSB resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for PCell
> or PSCell in EN-DC or NE-DC or SA; or PCell in NR-DC
>
> \- P~CBD~ = 1.
>
> For each SSB resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for PSCell
> in NR-DC
>
> \- P~CBD~ = 2 if UE is configured for candidate beam detection on
> SCell, 1 otherwise.

For each SSB resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a SCell

\- P~CBD~ = Z in EN-DC or NE-DC or SA.

\- P~CBD~ = 2\* Z in NR-DC.

\- Where Z is the number of band(s) on which UE is performing candidate
beam detection only for SCell

\- P~CBD~ is the number of band(s) on which UE is performing candidate
beam detection only for SCell.

partially overlap with CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for CBD measurement without any restrictions;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for CBD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for CBD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for CBD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period
for SSB based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB from cell with additional PCI for BFD or L1-RSRP
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period
for SSB based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurementÂ on one CC fully or partially
overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell
for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, if network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB for
CBD measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or
L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able to perform
the related SSB based measurements in one band without any measurement
restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable of
independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

### 8.5.6 Requirements for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

#### 8.5.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the
CSI-RS resources configured for candidate beam detection are actually
transmitted within UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period
specified in clause 8.5.6.2. The requirements in this clause apply when
UE is required to perform candidate beam detection on no more than 1
serving cell per band unless otherwise specified. For UE supporting
*intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided for the configured FR1
intra-band non-contiguous CA, the requirements in this clause apply when
UE is required to perform candidate beam detection on no more than 2
serving cells per band if these 2 serving cells are in non-contiguous
carriers, and no more than 1 serving cell per band otherwise.

#### 8.5.6.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured CSI-RS resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$
estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ period becomes better
than the threshold Q~in\_LR~ within T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ period
provided CSI-RS ÃŠs/Iot is according to annex B.2.4.2 for a corresponding
band.

The UE shall monitor the configured CSI-RS resources using the
evaluation period in table 8.5.6.2-1 and 8.5.6.2-2 corresponding to the
non-DRX mode, if the configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.5.6.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.5.6.2-2 for
FR2 with scaling factor N, where

> \- N = *2, 4 or 6* for serving cell in FR2-1 if the UE supports
> *fastBeamSweepingMultiRx-r18* according to the conditions in clause
> 3.6.19
>
> \- N=8 for other cases in FR2-1, and

\- N=12 for FR2-2.

For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and when concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* or
*musim-GapPreference-r17* or both *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and
*musim-GapPreference-r17* and when concurrent gaps or periodic MUSIM
gaps or both concurrent GAPs and periodic MUSIM gaps are configured,

\- an CSI-RS resource occasion for candidate beam detection is not
considered to be overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap occasion is
dropped according to clause 9.1.8 and 9.1.10,

\- P value for a CBD-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~\> 0

> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
> the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps or
> periodic MUSIM gap(s) or NCSGs and per-FR measurement gaps or NCSGs,
> and, in case of Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and
> per-FR measurement gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and
> starting at the beginning of any CBD-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CBD-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions, MUSIM gap
occasions or SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CBD-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any non-dropped **GAP** occasion nor non-dropped
MUSIM gap occasion within the window W, and

\- N~available~ is the number of CBD-RS resource occasions that are not
overlapped with any non-dropped **GAP** occasion nor non-dropped MUSIM
gap occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W, and

\- an CSI-RS resource occasion for candidate beam detection is
considered to be overlapped with the MUSIM gap if it overlaps a MUSIM
gap occasion, and

**- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target** CBD-RS, and

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.

Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* nor *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* nor
supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* or when neither of the above
configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement gaps, concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s), concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s), and periodic MUSIM gaps,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with
any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P = 1, when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with GAP
and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$ when candidate
beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and candidate beam
detection RS is not overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< xRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with GAP and candidate
beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~
\< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P =P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with GAP and candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  xRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
GAP and T~SMTCperiod~ = xRP and T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{Min(xRP,\ T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully
overlapped with GAP

\- $P = \frac{3}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{xRP}}}$,, when candidate
beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and candidate beam
detection RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with GAP
(T~SMTCperiod~ \< xRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the CBD-RS resource outside GAP is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and,

\- not overlapped by the RSSI symbols indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*
and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI symbol indicated
by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that *ss-RSSI-Measurement* is
configured.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present, T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows
*smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the
same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same
offset.

\- When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,

\- a CBD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if it overlaps the GAP occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- Otherwise, when NCSG GAP only is configured,

\- a CBD-RS resource or an SMTC occasion is considered to be overlapped
with the GAP if

\- it overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, or

\- it overlaps the ML of NCSG in FR2, and there exists a target carrier
to be measured within NCSG that is intra-frequency carrier or
inter-frequency carrier in the same band as the serving cell, or
inter-frequency carrier in different band as the serving cell and UE
does not support IBM between the target carrier and the serving cell,

\- and

\- xRP = VIRP

> \- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG only, an CBD-RS resource or an
> SMTC occasion is only considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the
> Pre-MG is activated.

\- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s)
or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, a CBD-RS
resource or an SMTC occasion is not considered to be overlapped by a GAP
occasion if the GAP occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8,
clause 9.1.12, clause 9.1.13, respectively.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for CBD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
CBD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the CSI-RS is on the same
OFDM symbols with RLM, BFD, BM-RS, or other CBD-RS, according to the
measurement restrictions defined in clause 8.5.6.3.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with CSI-RS
resource occasion for candidate beam detection, longer evaluation period
would be expected.

When UE is configured with MUSIM gap(s), and if CSI-RS resource
occasions for candidate beam detection are fully overlapped with MUSIM
gap(s), or the union of MUSIM gap(s) and GAPs, no requirement applies
for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer CBD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The values of M~CBD~ used in table 8.5.6.2-1 and table 8.5.6.2-2 are
defined as

> \- M~CBD~ = 3, if the CSI-RS resource configured in the set
> ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ is transmitted with Density = 3 and over the bandwidth
> â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

The values of P~CBD~ used in table 8.5.6.2-1 and table 8.5.6.2-2 are
defined as

> \- For each CSI-RS resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for
> PCell or PSCell in EN-DC or NE-DC or SA; or PCell in NR-DC
>
> \- P~CBD~ = 1.
>
> \- For each CSI-RS resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for
> PSCell in NR-DC
>
> \- P~CBD~ = 2 if UE is configured for candidate beam detection on
> SCell, 1 otherwise.

\- For each CSI-RS resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a
SCell

\- P~CBD~ = Z in EN-DC or NE-DC or SA.

\- P~CBD~ = 2\* Z in NR-DC.

\- Where Z is the number of band(s) on which UE is performing candidate
beam detection only for SCell

\- P~CBD~ is the number of band(s) on which UE is performing candidate
beam detection only for SCell.

#### 8.5.6.3 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

The SSB mentioned in this clause can be associated with either the
serving cell PCI or a PCI different from serving cell PCI.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for CBD measurement in the PRBs that overlap
with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement has same
SCS than CSI-RS for CBD measurement, the UE shall be able to perform
CSI-RS based CBD measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement has
different SCS than CSI-RS for CBD measurement, the UE shall be able to
perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement with restrictions according to its
capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement for without
restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for CBD measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of
but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and SSB. Longer evaluation
period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement
fully or partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate
LTM neighbour cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for CBD measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement fully or partially overlaps
with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell for
intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap, if CSI-RS and SSB have different SCS and UE
does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is required to

partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbour cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and
SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based CBD is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and the other
CSI-RS. Longer evaluation period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5.7 Scheduling availability of UE during beam failure detection

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing beam
failure detection are described in the following clauses.

#### 8.5.7.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to beam failure detection
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured for BFD with the same SCS as
PDSCH or PDCCH in FR1.

#### 8.5.7.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to beam failure
detection when SSB is configured as BFD. For UEs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the following restrictions
apply due to beam failure detection when SSB is configured as BFD.

> \- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
> PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols
> to be measured for beam failure detection.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell apply to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with
restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured on the
non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell apply to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with
restricted symbols if ***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are
no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other
bands than the bands in which PCell or PSCell is configured.

When inter-band FR1-FR1 NR-DC is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in the bands due to beam
failure detection performed on FR1 serving PCell or PSCell in different
bands.

#### 8.5.7.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to beam failure
detection.

\- For the case where no RSs are provided for BFD, or when CSI-RS is
configured for BFD is explicitly configured and is type-D QCLed with
active TCI state for PDCCH or PDSCH, and the CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS
resource set with repetition ON

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to beam failure detection
performed based on the CSI-RS.

\- For the case when UE supporting *schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18*
in FR2-1 is configured to receive two PDSCH transmission occasions from
two different QCL sources on the cell according to the conditions in
clause 3.6.19, there are no scheduling restrictions for the PDSCHs due
to beam failure detection performed based on the CSI-RS, when following
conditions are met:

\- the CSI-RS configured for BFD is not in a CSI-RS resource set with
repetition ON, and

\- the CSI-RS configured for BFD has same QCL source as the active TCI
state of one of PDSCHs and has different QCL-TypeD from the other PDSCH,
and

\- \[The two CSI-RS resources and both PDSCHs are overlapped on the same
OFDM symbol\], and

\- The CSI-RS and both of the PDSCHs are on the same OFDM symbol(s), or
the CSI-RS and one of the PDSCHs with different QCL typeD are on the
same OFDM symbol(s) when partially overlapping PDSCHs are scheduled, and

\- Resources of the active TCI states for the two PDSCHs have been
reported as a resource group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report

\- Otherwise

\- For FR2-1 or the BFD-RS is not using 480 kHz SCS or 960 kHz SCS on
FR2-2, the UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on BFD-RS resource
symbols to be measured for beam failure detection.

\- For FR2-2 and the BFD-RS is using 480 kHz SCS or 960 kHz SCS, the UE
is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive PDCCH, PDSCH
or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on BFD-RS resource symbols to
be measured for beam failure detection, and on one data symbol before
each BFD-RS symbol to be measured and one data symbol after each BFD-RS
symbol to be measured.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, the scheduling
restrictions on FR2 serving PCell or PSCell apply to all serving cells
in the same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with
restricted symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to beam
failure detection performed on FR2 serving cell(s) in different band(s),
provided that UE is capable of independent beam management on this FR2
band pair. Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is
configured with different numerology between SSB on one FR2 band and
data on the other FR2 band provided the UE is configured for IBM
operation for the band pair.

For FR2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for BFD
measurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for BFD
measurement.

#### 8.5.7.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing beam failure detection on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA and NR-DC

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to beam
failure detection performed on FR2 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to beam
failure detection performed on FR1 serving PCell and/or PSCell.

### 8.5.8 Scheduling availability of UE during candidate beam detection

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement for candidate beam detection are described in the following
clauses.

#### 8.5.8.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as link recovery detection
resource with the same SCS as PDSCH or PDCCH in FR1.

#### 8.5.8.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to L1-RSRP
measurement based on SSB as link recovery detection resource. For UEs
which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the
following restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB
configured as link recovery detection resource.

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH, TRS, CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB symbols
to be measured for L1-RSRP.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR1 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on one serving cell apply to all other serving cells in the
same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the
restricted symbols.

When intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation is configured for a
UE indicating *intraBandNR-CA-non-collocated-r18* and if
***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is not provided, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured on the
non-contiguous CC(s) in the same band. Otherwise, the scheduling
restrictions on one serving cell apply to all other serving cells in the
same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with the
restricted symbols if ***nonCollocatedTypeNR-CA-r18*** is provided.

When inter-band carrier aggregation within FR1 is configured, there are
no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) configured in other
bands.

When inter-band FR1-FR1 NR-DC is configured, there are no scheduling
restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) in one band due to candidate beam
detection performed on FR1 serving cell(s) in other bands.

#### 8.5.8.3 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR2

The following scheduling restriction applies due to candidate beam
detection

\- For FR2-1 or the reference symbols to be measured for candidate beam
detection is not using 480 kHz SCS or 960 kHz SCS on FR2-2, the UE is
not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive PDCCH, PDSCH,
CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on reference symbols to be
measured for candidate beam detection.

\- For FR2-2 and the reference symbols to be measured for candidate beam
detection is using 480 kHz SCS or 960 kHz SCS, the UE is not expected to
transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive PDCCH, PDSCH, CSI-RS for
tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on reference symbols to be measured for
candidate beam detection, and on one data symbol before each reference
symbol to be measured for candidate beam detection and one data symbol
after each reference symbol to be measured for candidate beam detection.

When intra-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is configured, the scheduling
restrictions on to one serving cell apply to all serving cells in the
same band on the symbols that fully or partially overlap with restricted
symbols.

When inter-band carrier aggregation in FR2 is performed, there are no
scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cells in the bands due to
candidate beam detection performed on FR2 serving cell(s) in different
band(s), provided that the FR2 serving cell(s) and the FR2 serving
cell(s) for candidate beam detection are in a FR2 band pair and UE is
capable of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.
Additionally, there is no scheduling restriction if the UE is configured
with different numerology between SSB on one FR2 band and data on the
other FR2 band provided the UE is configured for IBM operation for the
band pair.

For FR2, if following conditions are met,

\- UE has been notified about system information update through paging,

\- The gap between UE's reception of PDCCH that UE monitors in the
Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and the
PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater than 2
slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE
shall receive the PDCCH that UE monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and
the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols to be measured for CBD
mesurement; and

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 2, UE
shall receive PDSCH that corresponds to the PDCCH that UE monitors in
the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to be measured for CBD
mesurement.

#### 8.5.8.4 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement on FR1 or FR2 in case of FR1-FR2 inter-band CA and NR-DC

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR1 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR2 serving cell(s).

There are no scheduling restrictions on FR2 serving cell(s) due to
L1-RSRP measurement performed on FR1 serving cell(s).

### 8.5.9 Requirements for Beam Failure Recovery in SCell

#### 8.5.9.1 Introduction

For the UE provided with a configuration of PUCCH transmission with a
link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause 9.2.4 in TS 38.213
\[3\], if beam recovery procedure is triggered for any of SCells, the UE
shall transmit SR for UL resource followed by MAC CE providing one index
for at least one corresponding SCell with radio link quality is worse
than Q~out,LR~, and the index $q_{\text{new}}$ for a periodic CSI-RS
configuration or for a SSB provided by higher layer, as described in
clause 5.17 of TS 38.321 \[7\], if any, for a corresponding SCell.

For the UE not provided with a configuration of PUCCH transmission with
a link recovery request (LRR) as described in clause 9.2.4 in TS 38.213
\[3\], if beam recovery procedure is triggered for any of SCells, the UE
shall transmit preamble for UL-SCH resource application, followed by MAC
CE providing one index for at least one corresponding SCell with radio
link quality is worse than Q~out,LR~, and the index $q_{\text{new}}$ for
a periodic CSI-RS configuration or for a SSB provided by higher layer,
as described in clause 5.17 of TS 38.321 \[7\], if any, for a
corresponding SCell.

#### 8.5.9.2 Requirement

Provided that UE is configured by *schedulingRequestIDForBFR* a
configuration for LRR in a PUCCH transmission, after BFR is triggered on
any of SCells as described in clause 5.17 of TS 38.321 \[7\], UE shall
be capable of transmit PUCCH with an LRR within a period of T, where

\- T = T~1~ x Ceil((T~2~+D) /T~1~) in which T~1~, T~2~ and D are defined
as

\- T~1~ is equal to the periodicity of PUCCH configured with
*schedulingRequestIDForBFR*.

\- T~2~ = T~Evaluate\_CBD~ is the evaluation period specified in clause
8.5.5 or 8.5.6 for SSB or CSI-RS based candidate beam detection, that is
T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ or T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~, depending on the
applicable reference signal configured for candidate beam detection.

\- D = 2 ms is the UE processing time.

### 8.5.10 Minimum requirement at transitions for beam failure detection

When the UE transitions between DRX and no DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, for each BFD-RS resource, for a duration of time
equal to the evaluation period corresponding toÂ the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first
mode and the second mode. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use
an evaluation period corresponding to the second mode for each BFD-RS
resource.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of BFD resources to a
second configuration of BFD resources that is different from the first
configuration, for each BFD resource present in the second
configuration, for a duration of time equal to the evaluation period
corresponding to the second configuration after the transition occurs,
the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no less than the minimum
of evaluation periods corresponding to the first configuration and the
second configuration. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second configuration for each BFD
resource present in the second configuration.

When the UE transitions from a first configuration of active TCI state
of the CORESET to a second configuration of active TCI state of the
CORESET, for each CSI-RS for BFD present in the second configuration,
the UE shall use an evaluation period corresponding to the second
configuration from the time of transition.

For UE supporting *ncd-SSB-BWP-Wor-r18*, when the UE transitions between
BFD CD-SSB resource and BFD NCD-SSB resource due to BWP switching or due
to SCG activation or deactivation during one evaluation period, the UE
shall use an evaluation period that is the maximum of the evaluation
period corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after
the BWP switching or the SCG activation or deactivation. Subsequent to
this duration, the UE shall use an evaluation period corresponding to
the second SSB type for each BFD-RS resource.

### 8.5.11 Minimum requirement under IDC Interference

When the UE is provided with IDC solution, the UE shall also assess the
downlink radio link quality and meet the corresponding requirements in
clauseÂ 8.5.

8.5A Link Recovery Procedures when CCA is used on target frequency
------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.5A.1 Introduction

The requirements for link recovery procedure in the clause apply when
CCA is used on a serving frequency on the downlink.

The UE shall assess the downlink radio link quality of a serving cell
based on the reference signal in the set ${\overline{q}}_{0}$ as
specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] in order to detect beam failure on:

\- PCell in SA operation mode,

\- PSCell in EN-DC operation mode.

\- PSCell in NR-DC operation mode.

The RS resource configurations in the set ${\overline{q}}_{0}$ can be
periodic SSBs. UE is not required to perform beam failure detection
outside the active DL BWP. UE is not required to meet the requirements
in clauseÂ 8.5A.2 and 8.5A.3 if UE does not have set
${\overline{q}}_{0}$.

On each RS resource configuration in the set ${\overline{q}}_{0}$, the
UE shall estimate the radio link quality and compare it to the threshold
Q~out\_LR,CCA~ for the purpose of accessing downlink radio link quality
of the serving cell beams.

The threshold Q~out\_LR,CCA~ is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio level link of a given resource configuration on set
${\overline{q}}_{0}$ cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to
the BLER~out,CCA~ = 10 % block error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH
transmission. For SSB based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB,CCA~
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in table 8.5A.2.1-1.

Upon request the UE shall deliver configuration indexes from the set
${\overline{q}}_{1}$ *as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] , to higher
layers,* and the corresponding L1-RSRP measurement provided that the
measured L1-RSRP is equal to or better than the threshold Q~in\_LR,CCA~,
which is indicated by higher layer parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The UE
applies the Q~in\_LR,CCA~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained
from an SSB. The RS resource configurations in the set
${\overline{q}}_{1}$ can be periodic SSBs. UE is not required to perform
candidate beam detection outside the active DL BWP.

In the requirements of clause 8.5A, the term CBD-RS SSB occasions not
available at the UE refers to when the CBD-RS SSB is configured by gNB
in a cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but the first two
successive candidate SSB positions for the same SSB index within the set
of configured CBD-RS resources are not available at the UE due to DL CCA
failures at gNB during the corresponding evaluation period; otherwise
the CBD-RS SSB is considered as available at the UE.

The requirements in clause 8.5A apply for any *channelAccessMode*
configuration \[2\].

### 8.5A.2 Requirements for SSB based beam failure detection

#### 8.5A.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\overline{q}}_{0}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the
SSB configured for beam failure detection is actually transmitted within
the UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in
clause 8.5A.2.2, but occasionally may not be transmitted due to CCA
operation.

#### 8.5A.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured BFD-RS SSB resource in set ${\overline{q}}_{0}$ estimated
over the last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_CCA~ period becomes worse than the
threshold Q~out\_LR\_SSB,CCA~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_CCA~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_CCA~ is defined in table 8.5A.2.2-1
for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_CCA~ is defined in table 8.5A.2.2-2
for FR2-2 with scaling factor N=12.

\- For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and when concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and
when concurrent gaps are configured,

\- P value for a BFD-RS resource to be measured is defined as N~total~ /
N~outside\_MG~

> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1~, xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
> the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE **measurement gaps** or
> NCSGs and per-FR **measurement gaps** or NCSGs, and, in case of
> Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement
> gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and starting at the
> beginning of any BFD-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of BFD-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions within the
window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of BFD-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **GAP** occasion within the window W

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.

\- Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* nor *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* or when
neither of the above configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement
gaps, concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) and concurrent
measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s),

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
some but not all occasions of the BFD-RS SSB.

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with any
occasion of the BFD-RS SSB.

\- When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,

\- a BFD-RS resource is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it
overlaps a GAP occasion, and

\- xRP = MGRP

\- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG, a BFD-RS resource is only
considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

\- Otherwise, when NCSG only is configured,

\- a BFD-RS resource is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it
overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, and

\- xRP = VIRP

\- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s)
or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, a BFD-RS
resource is not considered to be overlapped by a GAP occasion if the GAP
occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8, clause 9.1.12, clause
9.1.13, respectively.

For FR2-2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS resource
is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped
with GAP and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS
resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP and
T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SSB~
\<MGRP) and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or
fully overlapped with GAP.

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with GAP and the BFD-RS
resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~)
and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \<
MGRP)

Where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside GAP is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by SSB-ToMeasure and K
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
SSB-ToMeasure and K data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by SSB-ToMeasure, given that SSB-ToMeasure is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and K is defined in clause 9.2.5.3.3, and;

> \- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
> ss-RSSI-Measurement and K data symbol before each RSSI symbol
> indicated by ss-RSSI-Measurement and K data symbol after each RSSI
> symbol indicated by ss-RSSI-Measurement, given that
> ss-RSSI-Measurement is configured, and K is defined in clause
> 9.2.5.3.3.
>
> \- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC
period among all CCs in the same FR2-2 band, given the SMTC offset of
all CCs in FR2-2 provided the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
SSB resource, SMTC occasion and GAP configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

#### 8.5A.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1, when the SSB for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure SSB for BFD measurement.

For FR2-2, when the SSB for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSB for BFD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for SSB based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

### 8.5A.3 Void

### 8.5A.4 Minimum requirement for L1 indication

When the radio link quality on all the RS resources in set
${\overline{q}}_{0}$ is worse than Q~out\_LR,CCA~, layer 1 of the UE
shall send a beam failure instance indication to the higher layers.

The beam failure instance evaluation for the RS resources in set
${\overline{q}}_{0}$ shall be performed as specified in clause 6 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_CCA~.

When DRX is not used, T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_CCA~ is max(2 ms,
T~SSB-RS,M~) ), where T~SSB-RS,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all RS
resources in set ${\overline{q}}_{0}$ for the accessed cell,
corresponding to either the shortest periodicity of the SSB in the set
${\overline{q}}_{0}$ .

When DRX is used, for SSB based link quality measurement,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_CCA~ = Max(1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5
Ã— T~SSB-RS,M~), if DRX\_cycle\_length â‰¤ 320 ms,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_CCA~ = DRX\_cycle\_length, if
DRX\_cycle\_length \> 320 ms.

### 8.5A.5 Requirements for SSB based candidate beam detection

#### 8.5A.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CBD-RS SSB resource in
the set ${\overline{q}}_{1}$ configured for a serving cell, provided
that the SSBs configured for candidate beam detection are actually
transmitted within UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period
specified in clause 8.5A.5.2, but occasionally may not be transmitted
due to CCA operation.

#### 8.5A.5.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured CBD-RS SSB resource in set
${\overline{q}}_{1}$ estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB\_CCA~
period becomes better than the threshold Q~in\_LR,CCA~ provided SSB\_RP
and SSB ÃŠs/Iot are according to annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured SSB resources using the evaluation
period in table 8.5A.5.2-1 corresponding to the non-DRX mode, if the
configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB\_CCA~ is defined in table 8.5A.5.2-1
for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB\_CCA~ is defined in table 8.5A.5.2-2
for FR2-2 with scaling factor N=12.

For FR1,

\- For a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and when concurrent
measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* and when concurrent measurement gap(s) with
NCSG(s) are configured, or a UE supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* and
when concurrent gaps are configured,

\- P value for a CBD-RS resource to be measured is defined as N~total~ /
N~outside\_MG~

> \- For a window W of duration max(T~L1~, xRP\_max), where xRP\_max is
> the maximum xRP across all configured per-UE **measurement gaps** or
> NCSGs and per-FR **measurement gaps** or NCSGs, and, in case of
> Pre-MG, all activated per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement
> gaps, within the same FR as serving cell, and starting at the
> beginning of any CBD-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of CBD-RS resource occasions within the
window W, including those overlapped with **GAP** occasions within the
window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of CBD-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **GAP** occasion within the window W

\- xRP = MGRP when configured GAP is activated Pre-MG or MG, and xRP =
VIRP when configured GAP is NCSG.

\- Otherwise, for a UE neither supporting *concurrentMeasGap-r17* nor
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* nor *concurrentMeasGapsNCSG-r18* or when
neither of the above configurations applies, i.e. concurrent measurement
gaps, concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s) and concurrent
measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s),

> \- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{xRP}}}$, when in the
> monitored cell there are GAPs configured for intra-frequency,
> inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are overlapping with
> some but not all occasions of the CBD-RS SSB,
>
> \- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no GAPs overlapping with
> any occasion of the CBD-RS SSB.

For FR2-2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with GAP and candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP
and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with GAP
and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially or fully
overlapped with GAP

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with GAP and
candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
GAP (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the candidate beam detection RS outside
GAP is

> \- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*
> and K data symbols before consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
> *SSB-ToMeasure* and K data symbols after consecutive SSB symbols
> indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is
> configured, where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of
> *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all the configured measurement objects merged on
> the same serving carrier, and where K is defined in clause 9.2.5.3.3,
> and;

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and K data symbols before each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and K data symbols after each RSSI
symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured, and where K is defined in clause
9.2.5.3.3.

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
present, T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows
*smtc1.* T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the
same FR2-2 band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2-2 have the
same offset.

> \- When a GAP is configured only and the GAP is not NCSG,
>
> \- a CBD-RS resource is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it
> overlaps a GAP occasion, and
>
> \- xRP = MGRP
>
> \- If the UE is configured with Pre-MG, a CBD-RS resource is only
> considered to be overlapped by the Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.

\- Otherwise, when NCSG only is configured,

\- a CBD-RS resource is considered to be overlapped with the GAP if it
overlaps the VIL1 or VIL2 of NCSG, and

\- xRP = VIRP

\- When concurrent gaps or concurrent measurement gap(s) with Pre-MG(s)
or concurrent measurement gap(s) with NCSG(s) are configured, a CBD-RS
resource is not considered to be overlapped by a GAP occasion if the GAP
occasion is dropped according to clause 9.1.8, clause 9.1.12, clause
9.1.13, respectively.

#### 8.5A.5.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based candidate beam detection

For FR1, when the SSB for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for CBD measurement without any restrictions;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for CBD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure SSB for CBD measurement.

For FR2-2, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSB for CBD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for SSB based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

8.5B Link Recovery Procedures for Redcap
----------------------------------------

### 8.5B.1 Introduction

The Redcap UE shall assess the downlink radio link quality of a serving
cell based on the reference signal in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ as
specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] in order to detect beam failure on PCell in
SA. The SSB and SMTC in this clause applies for both CD-SSB and NCD-SSB
if it is not additional specified.

The RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ *on PCell* can
be periodic CSI-RS resources and/or SSBs. UE is not required to perform
beam failure detection outside the active DL BWP. UE is not required to
meet the requirements in clauseÂ 8.5B.2 and 8.5B.3 if UE does not have
set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$.

On each RS resource configuration in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$, the UE
shall estimate the radio link quality and compare it to the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_Redcap~ for the purpose of accessing downlink radio link
quality of the serving cell beams.

The threshold Q~out\_LR\_Redcap~ is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio level link of a given resource configuration on set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the
BLER~out~ = 10% block error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission.
For SSB based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ is derived based
on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table
8.5B.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in table 8.5B.3.1-1.

Upon request the UE shall deliver configuration indexes from the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$*as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] , to higher layers,* and
the corresponding L1-RSRP measurement provided that the measured L1-RSRP
is equal to or better than the threshold Q~in\_LR\_RedCap~ , which is
indicated by higher layer parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The UE applies
the Q~in\_LR\_RedCap~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from
an SSB. The UE applies the Q~in\_LR\_RedCap~ threshold to the L1-RSRP
measurement obtained for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective
CSI-RS reception power with a value provided by higher layer parameter
*powerControlOffsetSS*. The RS resource configurations in the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$ can be periodic CSI-RS resources or SSBs or both SSB and
CSI-RS resources. UE is not required to perform candidate beam detection
outside the active DL BWP.

### 8.5B.2 Requirements for SSB based beam failure detection for Redcap

#### 8.5B.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSB
configured for beam failure detection is actually transmitted within the
UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.5B.2.2.

#### 8.5B.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured SSB resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the
last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Redcap~ period becomes worse than the
threshold Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Redcap~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Redcap~ is defined in table
8.5B.2.2-1 for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB\_Redcap~ is defined in table
8.5B.2.2-2 for FR2 with scaling factor N=8.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB.

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with

when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
(T~SSB~ \<MGRP) and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially
or fully overlapped with measurement gap.

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by SSB-ToMeasure and 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
SSB-ToMeasure and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by SSB-ToMeasure, given that SSB-ToMeasure is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

> \- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by

where,

> higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 8.5B.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC, UE is required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD
measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5B.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection for Redcap

#### 8.5B.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ${\overline{q}}_{0}$ of resource configurations for a serving cell,
provided that the CSI-RS resource(s) in set ${\overline{q}}_{0}$for beam
failure detection are actually transmitted within the UE active DL BWP
during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.5B.3.2. UE is
not expected to perform beam failure detection measurements on the
CSI-RS configured for BFD if the CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD
when applicable, with the RS in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP.

*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI

where,

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for BFD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
BFD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
BFD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

#### 8.5B.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for BFD measurement in the PRBs that overlap
with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement, the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement,
the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions
according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC or
different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for BFD measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS
based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for BFD measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for BFD measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource set
configured with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in set
![](./media/image3.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement
without any restriction.

### 8.5B.4 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication for Redcap

When the radio link quality on all the RS resources in set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ is worse than Q~out\_LR\_Redcap~, layer 1 of the UE
shall send a beam failure instance indication to the higher layers

The beam failure instance evaluation for the RS resources in set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ shall be performed as specified in clause 6 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_Redcap~.

When DRX is not used, T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_Redcap~ is max(2ms,
T~SSB-RS,M~) ) or max(2ms, T~CSI-RS,M~), where T~SSB-RS,M~ and
T~CSI-RS,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all RS resources in set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ for the accessed cell, corresponding to either the
shortest periodicity of the SSB in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ or CSI-RS
resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$.

When DRX is used, for SSB based link quality measurement,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_Redcap~ = Max(1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length,
1.5 Ã— T~SSB-RS,M~), if DRX\_cycle\_length â‰¤ 320 ms,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_Redcap~ = DRX\_cycle\_length, if
DRX\_cycle\_length \> 320 ms.

When DRX is used, for CSI-RS based link quality measurement,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_Redcap~ = Max(1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length,
1.5 Ã— T~CSI-RS,M~), if DRX\_cycle\_length â‰¤ 320 ms,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_Redcap~ = DRX\_cycle\_length, if
DRX\_cycle\_length \> 320 ms.

For HD-FDD UE, the above conditions and requirements
T~Indication\_interval\_BFD\_Redcap~ apply given that for each BFD-RS
configuration, at least one BFD-RS sample must fall with DL occasion
within an indication perio

### 8.5B.5 Requirements for SSB based candidate beam detection for Redcap

#### 8.5B.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSBs
configured for candidate beam detection are actually transmitted within
UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.5.5.2.

#### 8.5B.5.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured SSB resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ estimated
over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ period becomes better than the
threshold Q~in\_LR\_RedCap~ provided SSB\_RP and SSB ÃŠs/Iot are
according to annex B.2.4.1 for a corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured SSB resources using the evaluation
period in table 8.5B.5.2-1 and 8.5B.5.2-2 corresponding to the non-DRX
mode, if the configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB\_Redcap~ is defined in table
8.5B.5.2-1 for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB\_Redcap~ is defined in table
8.5B.5.2-2 for FR2 with scaling factor N=8.

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB,

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with measurement gap
and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully
overlapped with SMTC period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ =
0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is
partially or fully overlapped with measurement gap

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially
overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the candidate beam detection RS outside
measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

where,

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer CBD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The values of P~CBD~ used in table 8.5.5.2-1 and table 8.5.5.2-2 are
defined as:

For each SSB resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for PCell

\- P~CBD~ = 1.

#### 8.5B.5.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based candidate beam detection

For FR1, when the SSB for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for CBD measurement without any restrictions;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for CBD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for CBD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC, UE is required to measure one of but not both SSB for CBD
measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5B.6 Requirements for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection for Redcap

#### 8.5B.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for CBD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
CBD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the CSI-RS is on the same

#### 8.5B.6.3 Measurement restriction for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for CBD measurement in the PRBs that overlap
with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for CBD measurement, the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement without
restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for CBD measurement,
the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement for without
restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for CBD measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same
CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of
but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and SSB. Longer evaluation
period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and the other
CSI-RS. Longer evaluation period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5B.7 Scheduling availability of UE during beam failure detection for Redcap

> resource set with repetition ON

\- There are no scheduling restrictions due to beam failure detection
performed based on the CSI-RS.

\- Otherwise

\- The UE is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or receive
PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on BFD-RS resource

### 8.5B.8 Scheduling availability of UE during candidate beam detection for Redcap

Scheduling availability restrictions when the UE is performing L1-RSRP
measurement for candidate beam detection are described in the following
clauses.

#### 8.5B.8.1 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to L1-RSRP measurement
performed on SSB and CSI-RS configured as link recovery detection
resource with the same SCS as PDSCH or PDCCH in FR1.

#### 8.5B.8.2 Scheduling availability of UE performing L1-RSRP measurement with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For UEs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\]

measurement based on SSB as link recovery detection resource. For UEs
which do not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[14\] the
following restrictions apply due to L1-RSRP measurement based on SSB
configured as link recovery detection resource.

slots,

For the SSB and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing patterns 3, UE

### 8.5B.9 Minimum requirement at transitions for beam failure detection for Redcap

When the UE transitions between BFD CD-SSB resource and BFD NCD-SSB
resource due to BWP switching during one evaluation period, the UE shall
use an evaluation period that is the maximum of the evaluation period
corresponding to the first SSB type and the second SSB type after the
BWP switching. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use an
evaluation period corresponding to the second SSB type for each BFD-RS
resource.

The requirements in clause 8.5.10 shall also apply except the scenarios
described above.

8.5C Link Recovery Procedures for Satellite Access
--------------------------------------------------

### 8.5C.1 Introduction

The UE shall assess the downlink radio link quality of a serving cell
based on the reference signal in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ as specified in
TS 38.213 \[3\] in order to detect beam failure on PCell and the UE is
configured with only PCell, which is served by satellite access node
(SAN).

The RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ *on PCell* can
be periodic CSI-RS resources and/or SSBs.

On each RS resource configuration in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$, the UE
shall estimate the radio link quality and compare it to the threshold
Q~out\_LR~ for the purpose of accessing downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell beams.

The threshold Q~out\_LR~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio level link of a given resource configuration on set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the
BLER~out~ = 10% block error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission.
For SSB based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ is derived based
on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table
8.5C.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in table 8.5C.3.1-1.

Upon request the UE shall deliver configuration indexes from the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$*as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] , to higher layers,* and
the corresponding L1-RSRP measurement provided that the measured L1-RSRP
is equal to or better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~, which is indicated
by higher layer parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The UE applies the
Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from an SSB. The
UE applies the Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained
for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power
with a value provided by higher layer parameter *powerControlOffsetSS*.
The RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ can be
periodic CSI-RS resources or SSBs or both SSB and CSI-RS resources.

### 8.5C.2 Requirements for SSB based beam failure detection

#### 8.5C.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSB
configured for beam failure detection is actually transmitted within the
UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.5C.2.2.

#### 8.5C.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured SSB resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the
last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5C.2.2-1 for
FR1.

P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is the
maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and starting
at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W, if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For an FR1 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be expected
during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an
NR CGI.

  NOTE: T~SSB~ is the periodicity of SSB in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$. T~DRX~ is the DRX cycle length.   

#### 8.5C.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5C.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection

#### 8.5C.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ of resource configurations for a serving cell,
provided that the CSI-RS resource(s) in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$for beam
failure detection are actually transmitted within the UE active DL BWP
during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.5C.3.2. UE is
not expected to perform beam failure detection measurements on the
CSI-RS configured for BFD if the CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD
when applicable, with the RS in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP.

  Mapping from REG to CCE                                               Distributed

#### 8.5C.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the CSI-RS resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.5C.3.2-1 for
FR1.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ apply provided that the
CSI-RS for BFD is not in a resource set configured with repetition ON.
The requirements shall not apply when the CSI-RS resource in the active
TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS resource for BFD and the TCI
state information of the CSI-RS resource is not given, wherein the TCI
state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with
repetition ON.

P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is the
maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and starting
at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W, if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for BFD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
BFD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
BFD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

For an FR1 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be expected
during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an
NR CGI.

The values of M~BFD~ used in table 8.5C.3.2-1 are defined as

> \- M~BFD~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource(s) in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ used
> for BFD is transmitted with Density = 3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24
> PRBs.

The values of P~BFD~ used in table 8.5C.3.2-1 are defined as

For each CSI-RS resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ configured for PCell
SA

\- P~BFD~ = 1.

#### 8.5C.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for BFD measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement, the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement,
the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions
according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement without any restriction.

### 8.5C.4 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication

When the radio link quality on all the RS resources in set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ is worse than Q~out\_LR~, layer 1 of the UE shall send a
beam failure instance indication to the higher layers

The beam failure instance evaluation for the RS resources in set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ shall be performed as specified in clause 6 in
TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\]. Two successive indications from layer 1 shall be
separated by at least T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~.

When DRX is not used, T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ is max(2ms,
T~SSB-RS,M~) ) or max(2ms, T~CSI-RS,M~), where T~SSB-RS,M~ and
T~CSI-RS,M~ is the shortest periodicity of all RS resources in set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ for the accessed cell, corresponding to either the
shortest periodicity of the SSB in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ or CSI-RS
resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$.

When DRX is used, for SSB based link quality measurement,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = Max(1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 Ã—
T~SSB-RS,M~), if DRX\_cycle\_length â‰¤ 320 ms,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = DRX\_cycle\_length, if
DRX\_cycle\_length \> 320 ms.

When DRX is used, for CSI-RS based link quality measurement,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = Max(1.5 Ã— DRX\_cycle\_length, 1.5 Ã—
T~CSI-RS,M~), if DRX\_cycle\_length â‰¤ 320 ms,

\- T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ = DRX\_cycle\_length, if
DRX\_cycle\_length \> 320 ms.

### 8.5C.5 Requirements for SSB based candidate beam detection

#### 8.5C.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSBs
configured for candidate beam detection are actually transmitted within
UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.5C.5.2.

#### 8.5C.5.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured SSB resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ estimated
over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ period becomes better than the
threshold Q~in\_LR~ provided SSB\_RP and SSB ÃŠs/Iot are according to
annex B.2.19.1 for a corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured SSB resources using the evaluation
period in table 8.5C.5.2-1 corresponding to the non-DRX mode, if the
configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5C.5.2-1 for
FR1.

where,

P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is the
maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and starting
at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap** occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any **measurement gap** occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any **measurement gap** occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window
W, if UE does not support *parallelMeasurementWithoutRestriction* and
LEO satellites are measured for intra-frequency measurement, and

\- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

For an FR1 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be expected
during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an
NR CGI.

The values of P~CBD~ used in table 8.5C.5.2-1 are defined as:

For each SSB resource in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for PCell.

\- P~CBD~ = 1.

  NOTE: T~SSB~ is the periodicity of SSB in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$. T~DRX~ is the DRX cycle length.   

#### 8.5C.5.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based candidate beam detection

For FR1, when the SSB for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for CBD measurement without any restrictions;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for CBD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for CBD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5C.6 Requirements for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

#### 8.5C.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the
CSI-RS resources configured for candidate beam detection are actually
transmitted within UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period
specified in clause 8.5C.6.2.

#### 8.5C.6.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured CSI-RS resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$
estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ period becomes better
than the threshold Q~in\_LR~ within T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ period
provided CSI-RS ÃŠs/Iot is according to annex B.2.19.2 for a
corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured CSI-RS resources using the
evaluation period in tables 8.5C.6.2-1 corresponding to the non-DRX
mode, if the configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.5C.6.2-1 for
FR1.

P value for an RLM-RS resource to be measured is defined as:

> \- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ =
> 0
>
> \- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

For a window W of duration max(T~L1,~ MGRP\_max), where MGRP max is the
maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps, and starting
at the beginning of any RLM-RS resource occasion:

> \- N~total~ is the total number of RLM-RS resource occasions within
> the window, including those overlapped with **measurement gap**
> occasions or SMTC occasions within the window W, and
>
> \- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of RLM-RS resource occasions that are

>
> \- same as N~outside\_MG~, otherwise
>
> \- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target RLM-RS
>
> \- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for CBD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
CBD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

For an FR1 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be expected
during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to decode an
NR CGI.

The values of M~CBD~ used in table 8.5C.6.2-1 are defined as:

> \- M~CBD~ = 3, if the CSI-RS resource configured in the set

the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for CBD measurement,
the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement with
restrictions according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS based CBD measurement for without
restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based CBD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for CBD measurement without any restriction.

### 8.5C.7 Scheduling availability of UE during beam failure detection

equal to the evaluation period corresponding toÂ the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first

8.5D Link Recovery Procedures for ATG
-------------------------------------

### 8.5D.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 8.5D apply for link recovery procedure on ATG
UE.

The UE shall assess the downlink radio link quality of a serving cell
based on the reference signal in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ as specified in
TS 38.213 \[3\] in order to detect beam failure on PCell.

The RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ can be
periodic CSI-RS resources and/or SSBs. UE is not required to perform
beam failure detection outside the active DL BWP. UE is not required to
meet the requirements in clauseÂ 8.5D.2 and 8.5D.3 if UE does not have
set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$.

On each RS resource configuration in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$, the UE
shall estimate the radio link quality and compare it to the threshold
Q~out\_LR~ for the purpose of accessing downlink radio link quality of
the serving cell beams.

The threshold Q~out\_LR~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio level link of a given resource configuration on set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the
BLER~out~ = 10% block error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission.
For SSB based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ is derived based
on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table
8.5.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in table 8.5.3.1-1.

Upon request the UE shall deliver configuration indexes from the set
${\bar{q}}_{1}$*as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\] , to higher layers,* and
the corresponding L1-RSRP measurement provided that the measured L1-RSRP
is equal to or better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~, which is indicated
by higher layer parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The UE applies the
Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from an SSB. The
UE applies the Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained
for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power
with a value provided by higher layer parameter *powerControlOffsetSS*.
The RS resource configurations in the set ${\bar{q}}_{1}$ can be
periodic CSI-RS resources or SSBs or both SSB and CSI-RS resources. UE
is not required to perform candidate beam detection outside the active
DL BWP.

### 8.5D.2 Requirements for SSB based beam failure detection

#### 8.5D.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
${\bar{q}}_{0}$ configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSB
configured for beam failure detection is actually transmitted within the
UE active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause
8.5D.2.2.

Table 8.5D.2.1-1: Void

#### 8.5D.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured SSB resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the
last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.5D.2.2-1 for
FR1.

For FR1 ATG UE with one or multiple omni-directional antenna(s),

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB.

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR1 ATG UE with the antenna array,

\- P value for an BFD-RS resource to be measured is defined as:

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ with N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~L1~, MGRP~max~), where MGRP~max~ is
the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE measurement gaps starting
at the beginning of any BFD-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of BFD-RS resource occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with measurement gap occasions or
SMTC occasions within the window W, and

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of BFD-RS resource occasions that are
not overlapped with any measurement gap occasion within the window W

\- N~available~ is

\- the number of BFD-RS resource occasions that are not overlapped with
any measurement gap occasion nor any SMTC occasion within the window W

\- T~L1~ is periodicity of the target BFD-RS

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

  NOTE: T~SSB~ is the periodicity of SSB in the set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$. T~DRX~ is the DRX cycle length.   

#### 8.5D.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.

For FR1, when the SSB for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.5D.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection

#### 8.5D.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ of resource configurations for a serving cell,
provided that the CSI-RS resource(s) in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$for beam
failure detection are actually transmitted within the UE active DL BWP
during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.5D.3.2. UE is
not expected to perform beam failure detection measurements on the
CSI-RS configured for BFD if the CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD
when applicable, with the RS in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP.

Table 8.5D.3.1-1: Void

#### 8.5D.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the CSI-RS resource in set ${\bar{q}}_{0}$ estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.5D.3.2-1 for
FR1.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ apply provided that the
CSI-RS for BFD is not in a resource set configured with repetition ON.
The requirements shall not apply when the CSI-RS resource in the active
TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS resource for BFD and the TCI
state information of the CSI-RS resource is not given, wherein the TCI
state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with
repetition ON.

For FR1 ATG UE with one or multiple omni-directional antenna(s),

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS.

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

not meet previous conditions.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the CSI-RS is on the same
OFDM symbols with RLM, BFD, BM-RS, or other CBD-RS, according to the

The requirement in clause 8.5.10 shall apply.

8.6 Active BWP switch delay
---------------------------

### 8.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for a UE configured PCell or any
activated SCell in standalone NR or NE-DC, PCell, PSCell or any
activated SCell in MCG or SCG in NR-DC, or PSCell or any activated SCell
in SCG in EN-DC. The requirements in this clause also apply for a UE
configured with more than one BWP on PCell or any activated SCell with
CCA in standalone NR, or PSCell or any activated SCell with CCA in SCG
in EN-DC. The requirements in clause 8.6.4 apply for a UE which is
capable of *ul-LBT-FailureDetectionRecovery-r16* configured with more
than one UL BWP on PCell with CCA in standalone NR or PSCell with CCA in
EN-DC.

UE shall complete the switch of active DL and/or UL BWP within the delay
defined in this clause.

### 8.6.2 DCI and timer based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on a single CC with more than one BWP configurations
configured.

For DCI-based BWP switch, after the UE receives BWP switching request at
DL slot n on a serving cell, UE shall be able to receive PDSCH (for DL
active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the
new BWP on the serving cell on which BWP switch on the first DL or UL
slot occurs right after a time duration of T~BWPswitchDelay~ + Y which
starts from the beginning of DL slot n. Where,

\- Y=0, if the serving cell where UE receives DCI for BWP switch request
is same as the serving cell on which BWP switch occurs.

\- Y equals to the length of 1 slot, if the serving cell where UE
receives DCI for BWP switch is different from the serving cell on which
BWP switch occurs for any involved serving cell. In this scenario,
T~BWPswitchDelay~ + Y shall follow the smaller SCS of scheduling cell,
scheduled cells before and scheduled cells after active BWP change. If
both scheduling cell and scheduled cell are in FR2-2, Y shall follow the
SCS of 120 kHz.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
until the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration of
T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n except
DCI triggering BWP switch on the cell where DCI-based BWP switch occurs.
The UE is not required to follow the requirements defined in this clause
when performing a DCI-based BWP switch between the BWPs in disjoint
channel bandwidths or in partially overlapping channel bandwidths.

For timer-based BWP switch, the UE shall start BWP switch at DL slot n,
where slot n is the first slot of a DL subframe (FR1) or DL
half-subframe (FR2) immediately after a BWP-inactivity timer
*bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expires on a serving cell, and the UE shall
be able to receive PDSCH (for DL active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH
(for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving cell on which
BWP switch on the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration
of T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ after *bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\]
expires on the cell where timer-based BWP switch occurs.

Depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\], UE shall finish
BWP switch within the time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ defined in table
8.6.2-1.

Provided the UE does not have the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-states
before the BWP switch until a new MAC CE updating the required TCI-state
information for PDCCH and PDSCH is received after the BWP switch.

If UE has the information on the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP,

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with old TCI-states
before the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with new TCI-states after
the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

Provided the UE does not have the required activated TCI-state(s)
information to receive PDCCH/ PDSCH and to transmit PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in
the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-state(s) before the BWP switch
until a new MAC CE updating the required activated TCI-state(s)
information is received after the BWP switch.

If the BWP switch is triggered within or outside DRX active time, and
one of the two BWPs in a BWP switching is a dormant BWP \[7\], UE shall
be able to complete active BWP switching within the time duration of

\- T~dormantBWPswitchDelay~ =T~BWPswitchDelay~+ X, provided that the
dormancy indication is received in any of the first 3 OFDM symbols of a
slot in the serving cell where DCI for dormancy indication is receiveds,
or

\- T~dormantBWPswitchDelay~ =T~BWPswitchDelay~ + X + Z, provided that
the dormancy indication is received after the first 3 OFDM symbols of a
slot in the serving cell where DCI for dormancy indication is received,
where

\- T~BWPswitchDelay~ is defined in table 8.6.2-1 corresponding to the
smallest value among the SCS of the serving cell where UE receives
dormancy indication and the SCSs of the dormant BWP and the active BWP
immediately before or after switching the BWP of the serving cell where
BWP switching occurs;

> \- X equals to the length of 1 slot corresponding to the smallest
> value among the SCS of the serving cell where UE receives dormancy
> indication and the SCSs of the dormant BWP and the active BWP
> immediately before or after switching the BWP of the serving cell
> where BWP switching occurs. If both scheduling cell and scheduled cell
> are in FR2-2, X shall follow the SCS of 120 kHz.

\- Z equals to the length of 1 slot corresponding to the SCS of the
serving cell where UE receives dormancy indication.

For DCI-based BWP switch, if the new BWP is a dormant BWP, after the UE
receives BWP switching request at DL slot n on a serving cell, UE shall
be able to receive CSI-RS (for DL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on
the serving cell on which BWP switch on the first DL slot occurs right
after a time duration of T~dormantBWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the
beginning of DL slot n.

### 8.6.2A DCI based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case when the same
type of BWP switch (DCI based BWP switch) is performed on multiple CCs
simultaneously or over partially overlapping time period.

#### 8.6.2A.1 Simultaneous DCI based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

The delay requirements for simultaneous DCI based BWP switch on multiple
CCs in this clause apply only if the timing difference among the first
symbol of slot carrying DCI for all CCs is received within the MRTD for
inter-band CA as defined in clause 7.6.4.

For DCI-based BWP switch on multiple CCs, after the UE receives BWP
switching request, UE shall be able to receive PDSCH (for DL active BWP
switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWPs on
the serving cells on which BWP switch on the first DL or UL slot occurs
right after a time duration of T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ which starts
from the beginning of DL slot n, where slot n is slot which UE receives
the earliest BWP switching request among CCs on which UE is performing
simultaneous DCI-based BWP switching.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
until the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration of
T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n
except DCI triggering BWP switch on the cell where DCI-based BWP switch
occurs. The UE is not required to follow the requirements defined in
this clause when performing a DCI-based BWP switch between the BWPs in
disjoint channel bandwidths or in partially overlapping channel
bandwidths on any serving cell.

UE shall finish BWP switch within the time duration
T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ + Y~,~ which is defined as:

T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ = T~BWPswitchDelay~ + D\*(N-1) + D1\*(N1-1)

Where:

\- T~BWPswitchDelay~ is the BWP switching delay on single CC defined in
table 8.6.2-1 depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\].
T~BWPswitchDelay~ shall be based on the smallest SCS among SCS of all
involved CCs before and after BWP switch. If the BWP switch on multiple
CCs results in the change of the SCS on any CC among involved CCs,
T~BWPswitchDelay~ shall be based on the smallest SCS among all SCS
values of all involved CCs.

\- D is the incremental delay for each additional CC involved in
simultaneous BWP switch and depends on UE capability
*bwp-SwitchingMultiCCs-r16* \[TS 38.306, 14\] for switching between
non-dormant BWPs.

\- D1 is the incremental delay for each additional CC involved in
simultaneous BWP switch and depends on UE capability
*bwp-SwitchingMultiDormancyCCs-r16* or
*bwp-SwitchingMultiDormancyCC-DCI-0-3-And-1-3-r18* for switching between
dormant and non-dormant BWPs. Note: D1 shall be equal to or shorter than
D.

\- N, N1: for UE which is capable of per-FR gap, and no BWP switch
involves SCS change, N is the number of CCs in same FR for switching
between non-dormant BWPs, and N1 is the number of CCs in same FR for
switching between non-dormant and dormant BWPs; For UE which is not
capable of per-FR gap, or the BWP switches on any CC involves SCS
changing, N is the number of CCs undergoing simultaneous BWP switch
between non-dormant BWPs, and N1 is the number of CCs undergoing
simultaneous BWP switch between non-dormant and dormant BWPs.

-   Y=0, Â­if the serving cell where UE receives DCI for BWP switch is
    > same as the serving cell on which BWP switch occurs for each
    > involved serving cell.

Y equals to the length of one slot at smaller SCS of scheduling cell,
scheduled cells before and scheduled cells after active BWP change,

\- ~Â­~if the serving cell where UE receives DCI for BWP switch is
different from the serving cell on which BWP switch occurs for any
involved serving cell~.~ If both scheduling cell and scheduled cell are
in FR2-2, Y shall follow the SCS of 120 kHz. ~.~

Provided the UE does not have the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-states
before the BWP switch until a new MAC CE updating the required TCI-state
information for PDCCH and PDSCH is received after the BWP switch.

If UE has the information on the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP,

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with old TCI-states
before the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with new TCI-states after
the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

Provided the UE does not have the required activated TCI-state(s)
information to receive PDCCH/ PDSCH and to transmit PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in
the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-state(s) before the BWP switch
until a new MAC CE updating the required activated TCI-state(s)
information is received after the BWP switch.

If the BWP switch is triggered on multiple CCs simultaneously within or
outside DRX active time, and one of the two BWPs on each CC in a BWP
switching is a dormant BWP \[7\], UE shall be able to complete active
BWP switching within the time duration of

\- T~DormantMultipleBWPswitchDelay~ = T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~+X,
provided that the dormancy indication is received in any of the first 3
OFDM symbols of a slot in the serving cell where DCI for dormancy
indication is received, or

\- T~DormantMultipleBWPswitchDelay~ = T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ +X+Z,
provided that the dormancy indication is received after the first 3 OFDM
symbols of a slot in the serving cell where DCI for dormancy indication
is received, where

\- T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ is defined above corresponding to the
smallest value among the SCS of the serving cell where UE receives
dormancy indication and the SCSs of the dormant BWP and the active BWP
immediately before or after switching the BWP of the serving cell where
BWP switching occurs;

\- X equals to the length of 1 slot corresponding to the smallest value
among the SCS of the serving cell where UE receives dormancy indication
and the SCSs of the dormant BWP and the active BWP immediately before or
after switching the BWP of the serving cell where BWP switching occurs.
If both scheduling cell and scheduled cell are in FR2-2, X shall follow
the SCS of 120 kHz.

\- Z equals to the length of 1 slot corresponding to the SCS of the
serving cell where DCI for dormancy indication is received.

The number of CCs, N and/or N1, on which the UE can simultaneously
switch BWPs while still meeting the requirements, if any, related to
allocations on downlink, uplink, or transmission of HARQ-ACK, depends on
the UE reported capabilities related to BWP switching, the network
configuration and the BWP switch method.

#### 8.6.2A.2 Non-simultaneous DCI based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

In non-simultaneous case, the DCI-based BWP switch on multiple CCs is
triggered over partially overlapping time period between CCs or multiple
CCs in different Cell groups. The delay requirements for
non-simultaneous DCI based BWP switch on multiple CCs in this clause
apply only if:

\- the timing difference among the first symbol of slot carrying DCI for
all CCs involved in non-simultaneous BWP switch is received exceeds the
MRTD for inter-band CA as defined in clause 7.6.4, and

\- UE is operating in NR-DC (FR1+FR2), and

\- UE is capable of per-FR gap, and

\- BWP switch does not involve SCS change

For non-simultaneous DCI based BWP switch on multiple CCs, BWP switching
delay requirements defined in clause 8.6.2 apply when BWP switching
occurs on single CC in the cell group. BWP switching delay requirements
defined in clause 8.6.2A.1 apply when simultaneous BWP switching occurs
on multiple CCs in the cell group.

### 8.6.2B Timer based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case when the same
type of BWP switch (timer based BWP switch) is performed on multiple CCs
simultaneously or over partially overlapping time period.

#### 8.6.2B.1 Simultaneous timer based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

The delay requirements for simultaneous timer based BWP switch on
multiple CCs in this clause apply only if the timing difference among
the beginning of the slot where timer based BWP switching starts for all
CCs is within the MRTD for inter-band CA as defined in clause 7.6.4.

For timer-based BWP switch on multiple CCs, UE shall start BWP switch at
DL slot n, where slot n is the first slot of a DL subframe (in FR1) or
DL half-subframe ((in FR2) immediately after the earliest BWP-inactivity
timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expiration occurs on multiple serving
cells, and the UE shall be able to receive PDSCH (for DL active BWP
switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWPs on
the serving cells on which BWP switch on the first DL or UL slot occurs
right after a time duration of T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ which starts
from the beginning of DL slot n, where T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ is
defined in clause 8.6.2A.1.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during time duration T~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ after
*bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expires on the cell where timer-based BWP
switch occurs.

Provided the UE does not have the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-states
before the BWP switch until a new MAC CE updating the required TCI-state
information for PDCCH and PDSCH is received after the BWP switch.

If UE has the information on the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP,

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with old TCI-states
before the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with new TCI-states after
the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

Provided the UE does not have the required activated TCI-state(s)
information to receive PDCCH/ PDSCH and to transmit PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in
the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-state(s) before the BWP switch
until a new MAC CE updating the required activated TCI-state(s)
information is received after the BWP switch.

#### 8.6.2B.2 Non-simultaneous timer based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

In non-simultaneous case, the timer-based BWP switch on multiple CCs is
triggered over partially overlapping time period.

The delay requirements for non-simultaneous timer based BWP switch on
multiple CCs in this clause apply if the timing difference among the
beginning of the slot where timer based BWP switching starts for all CCs
is exceeds the MRTD for inter-band CA as defined in clause 7.6.4, and
the BWP switch does not involve SCS change. The UE performs the
non-simultaneous timer-based BWP switch on the CCs sequentially.

For non-simultaneous timer-based BWP switch, the UE shall be able to
receive PDSCH (for DL active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL
active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving cell on which BWP
switch on the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration of
T~MultipleBWPswitchDelayTotal~ which starts from the beginning of DL
slot n, where slot n is the first slot of a DL subframe (in FR1) or DL
half-subframe (in FR2) immediately after the earliest BWP-inactivity
timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expires.

**T**~MultipleBWPswitchDelayTotal~ **= T~Delay~ +
T**~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~

Where:

**T~Delay~ is the time required to complete the ongoing timer-based BWP
switching on other CCs.**

**T**~MultipleBWPswitchDelay~ **is the timer-based BWP switch delay on
current single CC defined in clause 8.6.2 or simultaneously triggered on
multiple CCs defined in clause 8.6.2B.1.**

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during time duration T~MultipleBWPswitchDelayTotal~ after
*bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expires on the cell where timer-based BWP
switch occurs.

Provided the UE does not have the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-states
before the BWP switch until a new MAC CE updating the required TCI-state
information for PDCCH and PDSCH is received after the BWP switch.

If UE has the information on the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP,

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with old TCI-states
before the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with new TCI-states after
the delay as specified in clause 8.10 in the new BWP.

Provided the UE does not have the required activated TCI-state(s)
information to receive PDCCH/ PDSCH and to transmit PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in
the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-state(s) before the BWP switch
until a new MAC CE updating the required activated TCI-state(s)
information is received after the BWP switch.

### 8.6.3 RRC based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on a single CC with one or more than one BWP
configuration(s) configured, with

-   Active BWP switch or parameter change of its active BWPs for SpCell

-   Parameter change of its active BWPs except parameter
    > *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* and *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* for
    > SCell

For RRC-based BWP switch, after the UE receives RRC reconfiguration
involving active BWP switching or parameter change of its active BWP, UE
shall be able to receive PDSCH/PDCCH (for DL active BWP switch) or
transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving
cell on which BWP switch occurs on the first DL or UL slot right after a
time duration of
$\frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
slots which begins from the beginning of DL slot n, where

DL slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command, and

$\text{NR\ Slot\ length}$ is determined by the smaller SCS between the
SCS before BWP switch and the SCS after BWP switch if the BWP switch
involves changing of SCS.

$T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ is the length of the RRC processing
delay in ms as defined in Table 11.2-1 in clause 11.2 in TS 36.331
\[16\] if the corresponding RRC message is embedded in E-UTRA RRC
message, otherwise it is the length of the RRC processing delay in ms as
defined in Table 12.1-1 in clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\], and

$T_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}} = 6ms$ is the time used by the UE to
perform BWP switch.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during the time defined by
${T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}$ on the
cell where RRC-based BWP switch occurs. When
${T_{\text{HARQ}} > \ T}_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ a longer switching
delay is allowed. Where $T_{\text{HARQ}}$ is the time between DL data
transmission and acknowledgement as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\].

### 8.6.3A RRC based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case when the same
type of BWP switch (RRC based BWP switch) is performed on multiple CCs
simultaneously or over partially overlapping time period.

The requirements in this clause shall apply:

-   Active BWP switching or parameter change of its active BWPs for
    > SpCell

-   Parameter change of its active BWPs except parameter
    > *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* and *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* for
    > SCells

#### 8.6.3A.1 Simultaneous RRC based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

Requirements in this clause apply only if RRC based BWP switching on
multiple CCs for NR-CA is triggered by a single RRC command.

For RRC-based BWP switch, after the UE receives RRC reconfiguration
involving active BWP switching or parameter change of its active BWPs,
UE shall be able to receive PDSCH/PDCCH (for DL active BWP switch) or
transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWPs on the serving
cells on which BWP switch occurs on the first DL or UL slot right after
a time duration
$\left\lceil \frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}} + D_{\text{RRC}}*(N - 1)}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}} \right\rceil$slots
which begins from the beginning of DL slot n, where

DL slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command, and

$\text{NR\ Slot\ length}$ is determined by the smallest SCS among all
SCS values of each CC before and after BWP switch if the BWP switch
involves changing of SCS, and

$T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}\text{\ and\ }T_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}\ $are
defined in clause 8.6.3, and

$D_{\text{RRC}} = 0$ for UE which is capable of type 1 BWP switching
delay depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\].
$D_{\text{RRC}} = D$ for UE which is capable of type 2 BWP switching
delay depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\], where D is
the incremental delay for each additional CC involved in simultaneous
BWP switch and depends on UE capability \[14\].

N is the number of CCs within the NR-CA configured for performing
simultaneous BWP switch.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during the time defined by
${T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}} + D_{\text{RRC}}*(N - 1)$
on the cells where RRC-based BWP switch occurs.

#### 8.6.3A.2 Non-simultaneous RRC based BWP switch delay on multiple CCs

In non-simultaneous case, the RRC-based BWP switch on multiple CCs is
triggered over partially overlapping time period in different Cell
groups. The delay requirements in this clause apply only if:

BWP switching on multiple CCs in different cell groups are triggered by
separate RRC commands, and

UE is operating in NR-DC (FR1+FR2), and

UE is capable of per-FR gap, and

BWP switch does not involve SCS change.

For non-simultaneous RRC-based BWP switch, after the UE receives RRC
reconfiguration involving active BWP switching or parameter change of
its active BWPs, UE shall be able to receive PDSCH/PDCCH (for DL active
BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWPs
on the serving cells on which BWP switch occurs on the first DL or UL
slot right after a time duration
$\left\lceil \frac{{{T_{\text{Waiting}} + T}_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}} + D_{\text{RRC}}*(M - 1)}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}} \right\rceil$
slots which begins from the beginning of DL slot n, where

DL slot n is the last slot containing the RRC command,

$\text{NR\ Slot\ length}$ is determined by the SCS value of each CC in
the second CG , and

$T_{\text{Waiting}}$ is the waiting time for RRC based BWP switch which
is upper bounded by the ongoing BWP switch time in the first CG defined
in clause 8.6.3A.1,

*M* is the number of CCs within the NR-CA configured for performing
simultaneous BWP switch in the second CG; M=1 if the BWP switch is
performed on single CC,

$T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ and $T_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}$ are
defined in clause 8.6.3, and

$D_{\text{RRC}}$ is defined in clause 8.6.3A.1.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during the time defined by
${T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC\ \ }} + D_{\text{RRC}}*(M - 1)$

UE detects lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount number of CCA failure within
lbt-FailureDetectionTimer*, the UE shall switch the active UL BWP to an
UL BWP configured with PRACH occasion and for which consistent CCA
failure has not been triggered as defined in TS 38.321 \[7\] clause 5.21
. The UE shall be ready to transmit PRACH on the new UL BWP of the
SpCell on the first UL slot occurs right after slot n+T~BWPswitchDelay~
+1, where T~BWPswitchDelay~ is defined in table 8.6.2-1. The UE shall
finish the UL BWP switch within the time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~

will be derived in a way similar to that in handover in clause 6.1B.1.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ on the SpCell in the UL BWP
switch. The UE is not required to follow the requirements defined in
this clause when performing a UL BWP switch between the UL BWPs in

bandwidths.

8.6A Active BWP switch delay for RedCap
---------------------------------------

### 8.6A.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for RedCap UE. UE shall complete
the switch of active DL and/or UL BWP within the delay defined in this
clause.

### 8.6A.2 DCI and timer based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on a single CC with more than one BWP configurations
configured.

For DCI-based BWP switch, after the UE receives BWP switching request at
DL slot n on a serving cell, UE shall be able to receive PDSCH (for DL
active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the
new BWP on the serving cell on which BWP switch on the first DL or UL
slot occurs right after a time duration of T~BWPswitchDelay~ + Y which
starts from the beginning of DL slot n. Where,

\- Y=0, if the serving cell where UE receives DCI for BWP switch request
is same as the serving cell on which BWP switch occurs.

\- Y equals to the length of 1 slot, if the serving cell where UE
receives DCI for BWP switch is different from the serving cell on which
BWP switch occurs for any involved serving cell. In this scenario,
T~BWPswitchDelay~ + Y shall follow the smaller SCS of scheduling cell,
scheduled cells before and scheduled cells after active BWP change.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
until the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration of
T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n except
DCI triggering BWP switch on the cell where DCI-based BWP switch occurs.
The UE is not required to follow the requirements defined in this clause
when performing a DCI-based BWP switch between the BWPs in disjoint
channel bandwidths or in partially overlapping channel bandwidths.

For timer-based BWP switch, the UE shall start BWP switch at DL slot n,
where slot n is the first slot of a DL subframe (FR1) or DL
half-subframe (FR2) immediately after a BWP-inactivity timer
*bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expires on a serving cell, and the UE shall
be able to receive PDSCH (for DL active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH
(for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving cell on which
BWP switch on the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration
of T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ after *bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\]
expires on the cell where timer-based BWP switch occurs.

Depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\], UE shall finish
BWP switch within the time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ defined in table
8.6A.2-1.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Provided the UE does not have the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-states
before the BWP switch until a new MAC CE updating the required TCI-state
information for PDCCH and PDSCH is received after the BWP switch.

If UE has the information on the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP,

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with old TCI-states
before the delay as specified in clause 8.10B in the new BWP.

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with new TCI-states after
the delay as specified in clause 8.10B in the new BWP.

If the BWP switch is triggered within or outside DRX active time, and
one of the two BWPs in a BWP switching is a dormant BWP \[7\], UE shall
be able to complete active BWP switching within the time duration of

\- T~dormantBWPswitchDelay~ =T~BWPswitchDelay~+ X, provided that the
dormancy indication is received in any of the first 3 OFDM symbols of a
slot in the serving cell where DCI for dormancy indication is receiveds,
or

\- T~dormantBWPswitchDelay~ =T~BWPswitchDelay~ + X + Z, provided that
the dormancy indication is received after the first 3 OFDM symbols of a
slot in the serving cell where DCI for dormancy indication is received,
where

\- T~BWPswitchDelay~ is defined in table 8.6.2-1 corresponding to the
smallest value among the SCS of the serving cell where UE receives
dormancy indication and the SCSs of the dormant BWP and the active BWP
immediately before or after switching the BWP of the serving cell where
BWP switching occurs;

\- X equals to the length of 1 slot corresponding to the smallest value
among the SCS of the serving cell where UE receives dormancy indication
and the SCSs of the dormant BWP and the active BWP immediately before or
after switching the BWP of the serving cell where BWP switching occurs.

\- Z equals to the length of 1 slot corresponding to the SCS of the
serving cell where UE receives dormancy indication.

For DCI-based BWP switch, if the new BWP is a dormant BWP, after the UE
receives BWP switching request at DL slot n on a serving cell, UE shall
be able to receive CSI-RS (for DL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on
the serving cell on which BWP switch on the first DL slot occurs right
after a time duration of T~dormantBWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the
beginning of DL slot n.

### 8.6A.3 RRC based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on a single CC with one or more than one BWP
configuration(s) configured, with

Active BWP switch or parameter change of its active BWPs for PCell

For RRC-based BWP switch, after the UE receives RRC reconfiguration
involving active BWP switching or parameter change of its active BWP, UE
shall be able to receive PDSCH/PDCCH (for DL active BWP switch) or
transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving
cell on which BWP switch occurs on the first DL or UL slot right after a
time duration of
$\frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
slots which begins from the beginning of DL slot n, where

DL slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command, and

$\text{NR\ Slot\ length}$ is determined by the smaller SCS between the
SCS before BWP switch and the SCS after BWP switch if the BWP switch
involves changing of SCS.

$T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ is the length of the RRC procedure delay
in ms as defined in clause 11.2 in TS 36.331 \[16\] if the corresponding
RRC message is embedded in E-UTRA RRC message, otherwise it is the
length of the RRC procedure delay in ms as defined in clause 12 in TS
38.331 \[2\], and

$T_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}} = 6ms$ is the time used by the UE to
perform BWP switch.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during the time defined by
${T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}$ on the
cell where RRC-based BWP switch occurs. When
${T_{\text{HARQ}} > \ T}_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ a longer switching
delay is allowed. Where $T_{\text{HARQ}}$ is the time between DL data
transmission and acknowledgement as specified in TS 38.213 \[3\].

8.6C Active BWP switch delay for satellite access
-------------------------------------------------

### 8.6C.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for a UE configured with only
PCell, which is served by satellite access node (SAN). The requirements
in this clause also apply for a UE configured with more than one BWP on
PCell.

UE shall complete the switch of active DL and/or UL BWP within the delay
defined in this clause.

### 8.6C.2 DCI and timer based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on a single CC with more than one BWP configurations
configured.

For DCI-based BWP switch, after the UE receives BWP switching request at
DL slot n on a serving cell, UE shall be able to receive PDSCH (for DL
active BWP switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the
new BWP on the serving cell on which BWP switch on the first DL or UL
slot occurs right after a time duration of T~BWPswitchDelay~ + Y which
starts from the beginning of DL slot n. Where,

\- Y=0, if the serving cell where UE receives DCI for BWP switch request
is same as the serving cell on which BWP switch occurs.

\- Y equals to the length of 1 slot, if the serving cell where UE
receives DCI for BWP switch is different from the serving cell on which
BWP switch occurs for any involved serving cell. In this scenario,
T~BWPswitchDelay~ + Y shall follow the smaller SCS of scheduling cell,
scheduled cells before and scheduled cells after active BWP change.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
until the first DL or UL slot occurs right after a time duration of
T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the beginning of DL slot n except
DCI triggering BWP switch on the cell where DCI-based BWP switch occurs.
The UE is not required to follow the requirements defined in this clause
when performing a DCI-based BWP switch between the BWPs in disjoint
channel bandwidths or in partially overlapping channel bandwidths.

For timer-based BWP switch, the UE shall start BWP switch at DL slot n,
where slot n is the first slot of a DL subframe (FR1) immediately after
a BWP-inactivity timer *bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\] expires on a serving
cell, and the UE shall be able to receive PDSCH (for DL active BWP
switch) or transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on
the serving cell on which BWP switch on the first DL or UL slot occurs
right after a time duration of T~BWPswitchDelay~ which starts from the
beginning of DL slot n.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ after *bwp-InactivityTimer* \[2\]
expires on the cell where timer-based BWP switch occurs.

Depending on UE capability *bwp-SwitchingDelay* \[2\], UE shall finish
BWP switch within the time duration T~BWPswitchDelay~ defined in table
8.6C.2-1.

Provided the UE does not have the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-states
before the BWP switch until a new MAC CE updating the required TCI-state
information for PDCCH and PDSCH is received after the BWP switch.

If UE has the information on the required TCI-state information to
receive PDCCH and PDSCH in the new BWP,

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with old TCI-states
before the delay as specified in clause 8.10D or 8.15D in the new BWP.

\- UE shall be able to receive PDCCH and PDSCH with new TCI-states after

Provided the UE does not have the required activated TCI-state(s)
information to receive PDCCH/ PDSCH and to transmit PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in
the new BWP, the UE shall use old TCI-state(s) before the BWP switch
until a new MAC CE updating the required activated TCI-state(s)
information is received after the BWP switch.

### 8.6D.3 RRC based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the BWP
switch is performed on the PCell with one or more than one BWP
configuration(s) configured, with

\- Active BWP switch or parameter change of its active BWPs for PCell

For RRC-based BWP switch, after the UE receives RRC reconfiguration
involving active BWP switching or parameter change of its active BWP, UE
shall be able to receive PDSCH/PDCCH (for DL active BWP switch) or
transmit PUSCH (for UL active BWP switch) on the new BWP on the serving
cell on which BWP switch occurs on the first DL or UL slot right after a
time duration of
$\frac{{T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}}{\text{NR\ Slot\ length}}$
slots which begins from the beginning of DL slot n, where

DL slot n is the last slot overlapping with the PDSCH containing the RRC
command, and

$\text{NR\ Slot\ length}$ is determined by the smaller SCS between the
SCS before BWP switch and the SCS after BWP switch if the BWP switch
involves changing of SCS.

$T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ is the length of the RRC procedure delay
in ms as defined in clause 12 in TS 38.331 \[2\], and

$T_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}} = 6ms$ is the time used by the UE to
perform BWP switch.

The UE is not required to transmit UL signals or receive DL signals
during the time defined by
${T_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}} + T}_{\text{BWPswitchDelayRRC}}$ on
PCell. When ${T_{\text{HARQ}} > \ T}_{\text{RRCprocessingDelay}}$ a
longer switching delay is allowed. Where $T_{\text{HARQ}}$ is the time
between DL data transmission and acknowledgement as specified in TS
38.213 \[3\].

--------------------------------------

### 8.9A.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall
be able to perform conditional PSCell addition in EN-DC or NR-DC. The
requirements in this clause are applicable to EN-DC and NR-DC.

### 8.9A.2 Conditional PSCell Addition Delay Requirement

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
only PCell in FR1.

Upon receiving conditional PSCell addition in subframe *n*, the UE shall
be capable to transmit PRACH preamble towards PSCell no later than in
subframe *n* + T~config\_PSCell\_Addition\_Conditional~:

Where:

T~config\_PSCell\_Addition\_Conditional~ = T~RRC\_delay~ + *T~Event\_DU~
+* T~measure~ + T~UE\_preparation~ + T~processing~ + T~âˆ†~ +
T~PSCell\_\ DU~ + 2 ms

T~RRC\_delay~ is the RRC processing delay defined in clause 11.2 in TS
36.331 \[16\] which is the corresponding RRC message embedded in E-UTRA
RRC message, otherwise it is the RRC procedure delay defined in clause
12 in TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\] for processing the conditional PSCell addition
command.

*T~Event\_DU~* is the delay uncertainty which is the time from when the
UE successfully decodes a conditional PSCell addition command until a
condition exists at the measurement reference point which will trigger
the conditional PSCell addition.

**T~measure~** is the measurements time stated in clause 8.9A.2.1.

T~UE\_preparation~ is the UE preparation time for conditional PSCell

information of the target cell. T~âˆ†~ = 1\*Trs ms.

T~PSCell\_\ DU~ is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first
available PRACH occasion in the PSCell. T~PSCell\_\ DU~ is up to the
summation of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to
PRACH occasion associated period is defined in table 8.1-1 of TS 38.213
\[3\].

Trs is the SMTC periodicity of the target cell if the UE has been
provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in PSCell
addition message, otherwise Trs is the SMTC configured in the
measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing. If
the UE is not provided SMTC configuration or measurement object on this
frequency, the requirement in this clause is applied with Trs = 5 ms
assuming the SSB transmission periodicity is 5 ms. There is no
requirement if the SSB transmission periodicity is not 5 ms.

The PCell interruption specified in clause 8.2 is allowed only after the
UE starts to execute a conditional PSCell addition.

#### 8.9A.2.1 Measurement time

The measurement time delay is defined from the end of *T~Event\_DU~*
until UE executes a PSCell addition and interruption time starts.

The measurement time delay measured without Time To Trigger (TTT) and L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.3.4. When TTT or L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSB measured from the cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or Tidentify\_inter\_with\_index for
PSCell addition. If a cell, which has been detectable at least for the
time period T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or
Tidentify\_inter\_with\_index for PSCell addition, becomes undetectable
for a period and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers a
PSCell addition, the measurement time delay shall be less than
TSSB\_measurement\_period\_inter provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than Â± 3200/$2^{Âµ}$ Tc while the measurement gap has
not been available and the L3 filter has not been used, where *Âµ* is the
SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3
filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.9B.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall

up period. T~processing~ = 40 ms.

> T~search\_CCA~ is the time for AGC settling and PSS/SSS detection. If
> the target cell is known, T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target cell is
> unknown and the target cell ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB, T~search~ = (3\*N+L~1~\*N)
> \* Trs ms, where L~1~ is the number of SMTC occasions groups with at
> least one SSB/SMTC occasion in the group is not transmitted by the gNB
> during the AGC settling and PSS/SSS detection. N is the Rx beam
> sweeping factor for FR2-2.

unknown PSCell, where L~2~ is the number of SMTC occasions not avaible
at the UE during the time tracking period.

T~PSCell\_\ DU~ is the interruption uncertainty due to the random access
procedure when sending PRACH to the new cell. T~PSCell\_\ DU~ can be up

PRACH occasion association period as defined in table 8.1-1 of TS 38.213
\[3\] and L~3~ is the number of consecutive SSB to PRACH occasion
association periods during which no PRACH occasion is available for
PRACH transmission due to UL CCA failure. L~3~ = 0 for Type 3 UL channel
access procedure as defined in TS 37.213 \[33\]. L~3~ = 0 if
*ra-ChannelAccess-r17* is not configured in FR2-2.

T~rs~ is the SMTC periodicity of the target cell if the UE has been
provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in PSCell
addition message, otherwise T~rs~ is the SMTC configured in the
*measObjectNR* having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing. If
the UE is not provided SMTC configuration or measurement object on this
frequency, the requirement in this clause is applied with T~rs~ = 5 ms
assuming the SSB transmission periodicity is 5 ms. There is no
requirement if the SSB transmission periodicity is not 5 ms.

NOTE 1: The interruption time considering the potential extensions
caused by L~1~, L~2,~ L~3~ *and by the UL CCA failure detection/recovery
mechanism* is limited by the T304 timer. The UE behaviour at the T304
timer expiry is detailed in TS 38.331 \[2\].

In FR2-2, the PSCell is known if it has been meeting the following
conditions:

\- During the last 5 seconds before the reception of the PSCell
configuration command:

\- the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the PSCell being
configured and

\- T~processing~ is the SW processing time needed by UE, including RF
warm up period. T~processing~ = 20 ms when PSCell is in FR1, and
T~processing~ = 40 ms when PSCell is in FR2.

\- Trs is the SMTC periodicity of the target cell if the UE has been
provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in PSCell
addition message, otherwise Trs is the SMTC configured in the
*measObjectNR* having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing. If
the UE is not provided SMTC configuration or measurement object on this
frequency, the requirement in this clause is applied with Trs = 5 ms
assuming the SSB transmission periodicity is 5 ms. There is no
requirement if the SSB transmission periodicity is not 5 ms.

\- T~PSCell\_\ DU~ is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first
available PRACH occasion in the PSCell. T~PSCell\_\ DU~ is up to the

for a period and then the cell becomes detectable again and triggers a
PSCell addition, the measurement time delay shall be less than

being configured remains detectable during the time period
Tidentify\_intra\_without\_index or Tidentify\_intra\_with\_index for
intra-frequency PSCell change or the time period
Tidentify\_inter\_without\_index or Tidentify\_inter\_with\_index for

mechanism* is limited by the T304 timer. The UE behaviour at the T304
timer expiry is detailed in TS 38.331 \[2\].

The PCell interruption specified in clause 8.2 is allowed only after the
UE starts to execute a conditional PSCell change.

#### 8.11D.2.1 Measurement time

The measurement time delay is defined from the end of *T~Event\_DU~*
until UE executes a PSCell change to a target cell and interruption time
starts.

For intra-frequency PSCell change, the measurement time delay measured
without Time To Trigger (TTT) and L3 filtering shall be less than
Tidentify intra\_cca with index or Tidentify\_intra\_cca\_without\_index
defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or clause 9.2A.6.2.

For inter-frequency PSCell change, the measurement time delay measured
without TTT and L3 filtering shall be less than
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index~ or
T~identify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index~ defined in clause 9.3A.4. When TTT
or L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSB measured from the cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
Tidentify\_intra\_cca\_without\_index or
Tidentify\_intra\_cca\_with\_index for intra-frequency PSCell change or
the time period Tidentify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index or
Tidentify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index for inter-frequency PSCell change. If
a cell, which has been detectable at least for the time period
Tidentify\_intra\_cca\_without\_index or
Tidentify\_intra\_cca\_with\_index for intra-frequency PSCell change or
the time period Tidentify\_inter\_cca\_without\_index or
Tidentify\_inter\_cca\_with\_index for inter-frequency PSCell change,
becomes undetectable for a period and then the cell becomes detectable
again and triggers a PSCell change, the measurement time delay shall be
less than TSSB\_measurement\_period\_intra\_cca or
TSSB\_measurement\_period\_inter\_cca provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than Â± 3200 Tc while the measurement gap has not
been available and the L3 filter has not been used. When L3 filtering is
used, an additional delay can be expected.

8.11E Subsequent Conditional PSCell Change
------------------------------------------

### 8.11E.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall
be able to perform subsequent conditional PSCell change in NR-DC. The
requirements in this clause are applicable to NR-DC.

### 8.11E.2 Subsequent Conditional PSCell Change delay

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
only PCell in FR1.

The UE shall be capable to transmit PRACH preamble towards the new
target PSCell no later than in slot *n* +
**T~config\_PSCell\_Subsequent\_Change\_Conditional~**:

Where:

\- Slot n is the time when UE transmits SN *RRCReconfigurationcomplete*
message for the previous PSCell addition or change.

\- **T~config\_PSCell\_Subsequent\_Change\_Conditional~ = *T~Event\_DU~
+* T~measure~ + T~UE\_preparation~ + T~processing~ + T~âˆ†~ +
T~PSCell\_\ DU~ + 2 ms**

*- T~Event\_DU~* is the delay uncertainty which is the time from when UE
transmits SN *RRCReconfigurationcomplete* message for the previous
PSCell addition or change until a condition exists at the measurement
reference point which will trigger the subsequent conditional PSCell
change.

**- T~measure~** is the measurements time stated in clause 8.11E.2.1.

\- T~UE\_preparation~ is the UE preparation time for subsequent
conditional PSCell change, and starts after UE realizes the condition of
PSCell change is met and identity of new PSCell is determined.
T~UE\_preparation~ is up to 10 ms.

\- T~processing~ is the SW processing time needed by UE, including RF
warm up period. T~processing~ = 20 ms when source and target cells are
in the same FR, and T~processing~ = 40 ms when source and target cells
are in different FRs.

\- T~âˆ†~ is time for fine time tracking and acquiring full timing
information of the target cell. T~âˆ†~ = 1\*T~rs~ ms.

\- T~rs~ is the SMTC periodicity of the target cell if the UE has been
provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in PSCell
addition message, otherwise T~rs~ is the SMTC configured in the
*measObjectNR* having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing. If
the UE is not provided SMTC configuration or measurement object on this
frequency, the requirement in this clause is applied with T~rs~ = 5 ms
assuming the SSB transmission periodicity is 5 ms. There is no
requirement if the SSB transmission periodicity is not 5 ms.

\- T~PSCell\_\ DU~ is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first
available PRACH occasion in the PSCell. T~PSCell\_\ DU~ is up to the
summation of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to
PRACH occasion associated period is defined in table 8.1-1 of TS 38.213
\[3\].

The PCell interruption specified in clause 8.2 is allowed only after the
UE starts to execute a subsequent conditional PSCell change.

#### 8.11E.2.1 Measurement time

The measurement time delay is defined from the end of *T~Event\_DU~*
until UE executes a PSCell change to a target cell and interruption time
starts.

For intra-frequency PSCell change, the measurement time delay measured
without Time To Trigger (TTT) and L3 filtering shall be less than
T~identify\_intra\_with\_index~ or Tidentify\_intra\_without\_index
defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2.

For inter-frequency PSCell change, the measurement time delay measured
without TTT and L3 filtering shall be less than
T~identify\_inter\_without\_index~ or T~identify\_inter\_with\_index~
defined in clause 9.3.4. When TTT or L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected.

A cell is detectable only if at least one SSB measured from the cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
Tidentify\_intra\_without\_index or Tidentify\_intra\_with\_index for
intra-frequency PSCell change or the time period
Tidentify\_inter\_without\_index or Tidentify\_inter\_with\_index for
inter-frequency PSCell change. If a cell, which has been detectable at
least for the time period Tidentify\_intra\_without\_index or
Tidentify\_intra\_with\_index for intra-frequency PSCell change or the
time period Tidentify\_inter\_without\_index or
Tidentify\_inter\_with\_index for inter-frequency PSCell change, becomes
undetectable for a period and then the cell becomes detectable again and
triggers a PSCell change, the measurement time delay shall be less than
TSSB\_measurement\_period\_intra or TSSB\_measurement\_period\_inter
provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than Â±
3200/$2^{Âµ}$ Tc while the measurement gap has not been available and the
L3 filter has not been used, where *Âµ* is the SCS configuration as
defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 \[3\]. When L3 filtering is used, an
additional delay can be expected.

more spatial relation configurations on serving cell in MR-DC or
standalone NR. There is no requirement when the UE is requested to

carrier with the smallest SCS among the carrier(s) applying the beam
indication. The value of *beamAppTime-r17* is defined in TS 38.331
\[2\]. The known condition for TCI state defined in clause 8.16.2 is
applied.

If a PL-RS is *associated with or included in* UL TCI state or joint TCI
state, the UL TCI switching and PL-RS switching shall be completed at
the same time.

TCI state with the higher layer parameter *TCI-UL-State* associated to
SRS. The UE shall complete the switch of active uplink TCI state within
the delay defined in this clause when the UE is requested to switch to a
TCI state with the higher layer parameter *dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* or
*TCI-UL-State* associated to a DL RS.

PL-RS may be *associated with or included in* UL TCI state or joint TCI

using separate UL TCI state or joint TCI state of unified TCI state
switch framework.

In case of joint TCI state switch, UE is not expected to transmit on UL

state switch.

For separate UL TCI state switch or joint TCI state switch for PUCCH or
PUSCH, or semi-persistent/aperiodic/periodic SRS, when
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is set to 1, upon receiving
PDSCH carrying MAC-CE activation command in slot n on serving cell,

\- The UE shall be able to transmit uplink signal with the target TCI
state in the slot n+***T~HARQ~ +*** ${3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,Âµ}$
***+ NM\* (T~first\_target-PL-RS~ + 4\*T~target\_PL-RS~ + 2 ms)*** / *NR
slot length*.

Where,

\- T~HARQ~ (in slot) is the timing between DL data transmission and
acknowledgement as specified in TSÂ 38.213Â \[3\].

after MAC CE command is decoded by the UE for known TCI State.

\- T~target\_PL-RS~ is the periodicity of the target pathloss reference
signal which would be SSB or NZP CSI-RS

The requirements specified in this clause are applicable if no more than
4 different RSs are activated as PL-RS per serving cell among all active
UL (or joint) TCI states.

### 8.16D.4 DCI based uplink TCI state switch delay

When a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter with
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList*or *TCI-UL-State,* activated with TCI states
for uplink transmission by MAC CE indication of more than one
codepoints, and receives DCI format 1\_1/1\_2 with or without DL
assignment providing indicated TCI-State or TCI state pair in the active
TCI list for PCell, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information
corresponding to the DCI carrying the TCI-State indication.

The uplink TCI switching to the indicated UL TCI state or joint TCI
state in the DCI format shall be completed starting from the first slot
that is at least *beamAppTime-r17* symbols after the last symbol of the
PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK in response to the DCI triggering TCI state
activation. The value of *beamAppTime-r17*is defined in TS 38.331 \[2\].

If a PL-RS is *associated with or included in* UL TCI state or joint TCI
state, the UL TCI switching and PL-RS switching shall be completed at
the same time.

### 8.16D.5 Active Uplink TCI state list update delay

The requirements specified in this clause are applicable if

\- higher layer configuration '*unifiedTCI-StateType-r17*' is set to
'*separate*', and a MAC CE activates more than one target separate TCIs,
and at least one UL TCI is included, or

\- higher layer configuration '*unifiedTCI-StateType-r17*' is set to

defined in clause 8.16D.3.

The requirements specified in this clause do not apply if more than 4
different RSs are activated as PL-RS per serving cell among all active
UL (or joint) TCI states.

When UE receives PDSCH carrying MAC-CE for active TCI state list update,
and

'*joint*', or

\- higher layer configuration '*unifiedTCI-StateType-r17*' is set to
'*separate*', while the target TCI list comprises at least one DL TCIs
and at least one UL TCIs,

completes the DL and UL TCI list update.

The requirements in this clause are applicable when the source RS of the
active UL TCI state is a DL-RS and this DL-RS is included as one of the
source RSs in the DL active TCI list.

8.17 SCG Activation and Deactivation Delay
------------------------------------------

### 8.17.1 Introduction

This clause defines requirements for the delay within which the UE shall
be able to activate one SCG and deactivate on SCG.

The requirements shall apply for NR-DC with an NR PCell, PSCell or
SCell.

### 8.17.2 SCG Activation Delay Requirement

The requirements in this clause shall apply for the UE configured with
one deactivated SCG in NR-DC and when PSCell in one SCG is being
activated.

The delay within which the UE shall be able to activate the deactivated
SCG depends upon the specified conditions.

Upon receiving SCG activation command in slot *n*, the UE shall be
capable to transmit PRACH preamble or PUCCH or PUSCH towards PSCell no
later than in slot
$n + \frac{T_{activation\_ time}}{\text{NR\ slot\ length}}$ ,

where:

\- T~activation\_time~ = T~RRC\_delay~ + T~processing~ + T~search~ +
T~âˆ†~ + T~IU~ + 2 ms

\- T~RRC\_delay~ is the RRC procedure delay as specified in
TSÂ 38.331Â \[2\].

\- T~processing~ is the SW processing time needed by UE, including RF
warm up period. When PSCell is activated from deactivated state, if any
PSCell parameter is modified, T~processing~ = 20ms. Otherwise,
T~processing~ = 5 ms.

\- T~search~ is the time for AGC settling and PSS/SSS detection.

\- For RACH based PSCell activation, if the FR1 or FR2 PSCell is known,
T~search~ = 0 ms. If the FR2 PSCell is unknown and Es/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB, then
T~search~ = 24\* T~rs~ ms. If the target cell is an unknown FR1 PSCell
and Es/Iot â‰¥ -2 dB, then T~search~ =3\* T~rs~ ms.

\- For RACH-less based PSCell activation, if *bfd-and-RLM* is configured
and TCI state is known, T~search~ = 0 ms. There are no requirements if
TCI state is unknown.

\- T~âˆ†~ is time for fine time tracking and acquiring full timing
information of the target PSCell. T~âˆ†~ = 1\*Trs ms.

\- T~IU~: When RACH based PSCell activation is configured, it is the
delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available PRACH occasion in the
PSCell. T~IU~ is up to the summation of SSB to PRACH occasion
association period and 10 ms. SSB to PRACH occasion associated period is
defined in table 8.1-1 of TS 38.213 \[3\].

\- When RACH-less based PSCell activation is configured, it is the
uncertainty in acquiring the first PUSCH transmission occasion \[or SR
on PUCCH\].

\- Trs is the SMTC periodicity of the PSCell if the UE has been provided
with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in SCG activation
command, otherwise Trs is the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having
the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing. If the UE is not provided
SMTC configuration or measurement object on this frequency, the
requirement in this clause is applied with Trs = 5 ms assuming the SSB
transmission periodicity is 5 ms. There is no requirement if the SSB
transmission periodicity is not 5.

> In FR1 and FR2, the PSCell is known if it has been meeting the
> following conditions:

\- During the last 5 seconds before the reception of the SCG activation
command:

\- the UE has sent a valid measurement report for the PSCell being
activated and

\- One of the SSBs measured from the PSCell being activated remains
detectable according to the cell identification conditions specified in
clause 9.2.

\- One of the SSBs measured from PSCell being activated also remains
detectable during the PSCell activation delay T~activation\_time~
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clause 9.2.

> Otherwise it is unknown.
>
> If the UE is configured to perform *bfd-and-RLM* while the SCG is
> deactivated:

\- The TCI state is known if all the following conditions are met:

\- During the period from the reception of the RRC-based SCG
deactivation command deactivating the PSCell to the first transmission
towards PSCell on PUCCH or PUSCH:

\- UE has not detected beam failure

\- The side condition ÃŠs/Iot â‰¥ -3 dB is fulfilled for the RSs configured
for *bfd-and-RLM* for the PSCell being activated

\- The SSB measured remains detectable according to the cell
identification conditions specified in clause 9.2.

\- Otherwise, the TCI state is unknown.

> The PCell interruption specified in clause 8.2 is allowed only during
> the RRC reconfiguration procedure \[2\].

### 8.17.3 SCG Deactivation Delay Requirement

> The requirements in this clause shall apply for a UE which is
> configured with at least PCell and PSCell.
>
> Upon receiving RRC-based SCG deactivation command in subframe *n*, the
> UE shall accomplish the deactivation actions specified in

8.18 TRP specific Link Recovery Procedures
------------------------------------------

### 8.18.1 Introduction

The UE shall assess the downlink radio link quality of a serving cell
based on the reference signal provided in the two sets
${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ as specified in TS
38.213 \[3\] in order to detect beam failure on:

\- PCell in SA, NR-DC, or NE-DC operation mode,

\- PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode,

\- SCell in SA, NR-DC, NE-DC or EN-DC operation mode.

The RS resource configurations in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$
and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ *on PCell or PSCell* can be periodic CSI-RS
resources and/or SSBs. RS resource configuration in the two sets
${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ on SCell shall be
periodic CSI-RS. UE is not required to perform beam failure detection
outside the active DL BWP. UE is not required to meet the requirements
in clauseÂ 8.18.2 and 8.18.3 if UE does not have configured sets
${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$*.* UE is not required
to perform beam failure detection on a deactivated SCell, and also not
required to perform beam failure detection on resources which is
implicitly configured for a deactivated SCell. UE is not required to
perform beam failure detection on a SCell on which
${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ *and* ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ *is not configured.*

***If additionalPCIList is configured for the serving cell, the SSBs in
sets*** ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ *and* ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ ***can be
associated to the same additional PCI other*** than serving cell PCI.

On each RS resource configuration in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$
and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$, the UE shall estimate the radio link quality
and compare it to the threshold Q~out\_LR~ for the purpose of accessing
downlink radio link quality of the serving cell.

The threshold Q~out\_LR~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio level link of a given resource configuration on two sets
${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ cannot be reliably
received and shall correspond to the BLER~out~ = 10 % block error rate
of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission. For SSB based beam failure
detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in table 8.518.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based
beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in table 8.181.3.1-1.

Upon request the UE shall deliver configuration indexes from the two
sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ *and* ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$*as specified in
TS 38.213 \[3\] , to higher layers,* and the corresponding L1-RSRP
measurement provided that the measured L1-RSRP is equal to or better
than the threshold Q~in\_LR~, which is indicated by higher layer
parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The UE applies the Q~in\_LR~ threshold to
the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from an SSB. The UE applies the
Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained for a CSI-RS
resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power with a value
provided by higher layer parameter *powerControlOffsetSS*. The RS
resource configurations in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ *and*
${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ can be periodic CSI-RS resources or SSBs or both
SSB and CSI-RS resources. UE is not required to perform candidate beam
detection outside the active DL BWP. UE is not required to perform
candidate beam detection on a SCell on which ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$
*and* ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ *is not configured.*

### 8.18.2 Requirements for TRP specific SSB based beam failure detection

#### 8.18.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}\ $configured
for a serving cell, provided that the SSB configured for beam failure
detection is actually transmitted within the UE active DL BWP during the
entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.18.2.2. The SSB(s) in set
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ can be associated with an additionalPCI other
than serving cell PCI.

#### 8.18.2.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the configured SSB resource in two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~
period becomes worse than the threshold Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.18.2.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.18.2.2-2 for
FR2 with scaling factor N, where

> \- N = 2, 4, or 6 in FR2-1 for UE supporting
> *fastBeamSweepingMultiRx-r1*8, according to the conditions described
> in clause 3.6.19, and

\- N=8 for other cases in FR2.

For UE supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* and is configured with one
or more per-UE periodic MUSIM gaps,

\- P value for an BFD SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~SSB,~ SMTC period, MGRP\_max), where
MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE periodic MUSIM
gaps, per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement gaps within the
same FR as serving cell, and starting at the beginning of any configured
BFD SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of configured BFD SSB resource occasions
within the window, including those overlapped with **MUSIM gap**
occasions or SMTC occasions within the window

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of configured BFD SSB resource occasions
that are not overlapped with any **MUSIM gap** occasions within the
window W,

\- N~available~ is the number of configured BFD SSB resource occasions
that are not overlapped with any **non-dropped MUSIM gap** occasions nor
any SMTC occasion within the window W, and

\- T~SSB~ is periodicity of the target SSB resource for BFD.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with configured
BFD SSB resource occasions, longer evaluation period would be expected.

Requirements in this clause do not apply when N~outside\ MG~ = 0 due to
fully overlapping between target SSB resources for BFD and MUSIM gap
occasions within the window W.

Otherwise, when UE is not configured with periodic MUSIM gap(s) or not
supporting MUSIM gap capability,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB.

\- P=1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with
SMTC period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ = 0.5\*T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
(T~SSB~ \<MGRP) and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially
or fully overlapped with measurement gap.

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ =
T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped with
measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by SSB-ToMeasure and 1
data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
SSB-ToMeasure and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by SSB-ToMeasure, given that SSB-ToMeasure is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

> \- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by

>
> \- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

\- If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC
period among all CCs in the same FR2 band, given the SMTC offset of all
CCs in FR2 provided the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does not meet
previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is
requested to decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The value of P~TRP~ used in table 8.18.2.2-2 is defined as 2, if
SSB/CSI-RS resource in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ are overlapped, else it is 1.

#### 8.18.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the SSB
for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction.

\- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD measurement and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for BFD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period
for SSB based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined. When the SSB and CSI-RS for BFD measurements are from different
sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$, UE shall be able
to perform measure both SSB and CSI-RS for BFD measurements.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurementÂ on one CC is in the same or
adjacent OFDM symbol as SSB with a different PCI for RLM, CBD or L1-RSRP
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both SSBs with the two different
PCIs. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, if the network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB
for BFD measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD,
L1-RSRP or L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able
to perform the related SSB based measurements in one band without any
measurement restrictions on the other band, provided that UE is capable
of independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

For FR2, when the SSB for BFD measurementÂ ***in sets***
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ *or* ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ fully or partially
overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB for intra-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap on
candidate LTM neighbour cell in the same band, UE is required to measure
one of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.18.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection

#### 8.18.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$of resource
configurations for a serving cell, provided that the CSI-RS resource(s)
in two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$for beam
failure detection are actually transmitted within the UE active DL BWP
during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.18.3.2. UE is
not expected to perform beam failure detection measurements on the
CSI-RS configured for BFD if the CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD
when applicable, with the RS in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP.

#### 8.18.3.2 Minimum requirement

UE shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality on
the CSI-RS resource in two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~
period becomes worse than the threshold Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ within
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.18.3.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.18.3.2-2 for
FR2 with N=1. The requirements of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ apply
provided that the CSI-RS for BFD is not in a resource set configured
with repetition ON. The requirements shall not apply when the CSI-RS
resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS resource
for BFD and the TCI state information of the CSI-RS resource is not
given, wherein the TCI state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for
L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

For UE supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* and is configured with one
or more per-UE periodic MUSIM gaps,

\- P value for an BFD CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~CSI-RS,~ SMTC period, MGRP\_max),
where MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE periodic
MUSIM gaps, per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement gaps within
the same FR as serving cell, and starting at the beginning of any
configured BFD CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of configured BFD CSI-RS resource
occasions within the window, including those overlapped with **MUSIM
gap** occasions or SMTC occasions within the window,

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of configured BFD CSI-RS resource
occasions that are not overlapped with any **MUSIM gap** occasions
within the window W,

\- N~available~ is the number of configured BFD CSI-RS resource
occasions that are not overlapped with any **non-dropped MUSIM gap**
occasions nor any SMTC occasion within the window W, and

\- T~CSI-RS~ is periodicity of the target CSI-RS resource for BFD.

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with configured
BFD CSI-RS resource occasions, longer evaluation period would be
expected.

Requirements in this clause do not apply when N~outside\ MG~ = 0 due to
fully overlapping between target CSI-RS resource for BFD and MUSIM gap
occasions within the window W.

Otherwise, when UE is not configured with periodic MUSIM gap(s) or not
supporting MUSIM gap capability,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS.

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P = 1, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement
gap and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when the BFD-RS
resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap and the BFD-RS
resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with measurement gap and the
BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \<
T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped
with measurement gap and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not overlapped with
measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ = 0.5 Ã—
T~SMTCperiod~

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
(T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP) and the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is
partially or fully overlapped with measurement gap.

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with measurement gap
and the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially overlapped
with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the BFD-RS resource outside measurement
gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set ofÂ *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is
configured, T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of higher layer
parameter *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ corresponds to the value of
higher layer parameter *smtc1*. T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC
period among all CCs in the same FR2 band, provided the SMTC offset of
all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for BFD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
BFD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
BFD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is
requested to decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer BFD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The values of M~BFD~ used in table 8.18.3.2-1 and table 8.18.3.2-2 are
defined as

\- M~BFD~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource(s) in the two sets
${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ used for BFD is
transmitted with Density = 3 and over the bandwidth â‰¥ 24 PRBs.

The values of P~BFD~ used in table 8.18.3.2-1 and table 8.18.3.2-2 are
defined as

For each CSI-RS resource in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ configured for PCell or PSCell in EN-DC or NE-DC
or SA; or PCell in NR-DC

\- P~BFD~ = 1.

For each CSI-RS resource in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ configured for PSCell in NR-DC

P~BFD~ = 2 if UE is configured for beam failure detection on SCell, 1
otherwise.

For each CSI-RS resource in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ configured for a SCell

\- P~BFD~ = Z in EN-DC or NE-DC or SA.

\- P~BFD~ = 2\* Z in NR-DC.

Where Z is the number of band(s) on which UE is performing beam failure
detection only for SCell.

For UE not supporting *schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18* , the values
of P~TRP~ in table 8.18.3.2-2 is defined as 2, if SSB/CSI-RS resources
in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ are
overlapped, else it is 1.

For FR2-1, for UE supporting *schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18*
according to the conditions described in clause 3.6.19,, **the value of
P~TRP~** in table 8.18.3.2-2 is defined as 1, when:

\- CSI-RS resources in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ are not overlapped, or

\- CSI-RS resources in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ are overlapped and the following conditions are
met:

\- Both CSI-RSs are not in any CSI-RS resource set with repetition ON

\- The CSI-RS in set ${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ has same QCL source as
either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- the CSI-RS in set ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ has same QCL source as
either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- Resources of the active TCI states of the two PDSCHs, or QCL sources
of the default QCL assumption, or the active TCI state of PDSCH and QCL
source of the default QCL assumption have been reported as a resource
group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

\- else, the value of P~TRP~ is 2.

#### 8.18.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS beam failure detection

The SSB mentioned in this clause can be associated with either the
serving cell PCI or a PCI different from serving cell PCI.

The UE is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for BFD without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the CSI-RS measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE is not
required to receive CSI-RS for BFD measurement in the PRBs that overlap
with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement, the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement,
the UE shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions
according to its capabilities:

\- If the UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the UE
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
is required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement
and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, UE shall be
able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement without any restriction.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC or
different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
failure is detected, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for BFD measurement and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS
based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For both FR1 and FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbour cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap, UE is not required to
receive CSI-RS for BFD measurement in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement fully or partially overlaps
with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM neighbour cell for
intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement without gap, if CSI-RS and SSB have different SCS and UE
does not support simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology, UE is required to
measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement and SSB. Longer
measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC fully or
partially overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB from candidate LTM
neighbour cell for intra-frequency L1-RSRP measurement or
inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap in the same band, UE is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for CBD measurement and
SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, UE is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for BFD measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for BFD measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource set
configured with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in two sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$
*and* ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to UE,

\- Otherwise, UE shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement
without any restriction.

For FR2-1, there is no measurement restriction allowed for UE supporting
*schedulingMeasurementRelaxation-r18* according to the conditions
described in clause 3.6.19, and the UE is required to measure both the
CSI-RS for BFD and the other CSI-RS for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement,
provided the following conditions are met:

> \- Both CSI-RSs are not in any CSI-RS resource set with repetition ON,
> and
>
> \- One CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- the other CSI-RS has same QCL source as either

\- the active TCI state of a PDSCH scheduled in the same OFDM symbol or

\- the QCL source based on the default QCL assumption to be applied in
the same OFDM symbol according to TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.5, and

\- Resources of the active TCI states of the two PDSCHs, or QCL sources
of the default QCL assumption, or the active TCI state of PDSCH and QCL
source of the default QCL assumption have been reported as a resource
group in Rel-17 group-based RSRP report.

When two CSI-RSs for BFD measurements are from different sets
${\overline{q}}_{0,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$, UE shall be able to
perform measure both CSI-RSs for BFD measurements.

### 8.18.4 Minimum requirementÂ for L1 indication

When more than one TRP is configured with different resource set for
each TRP, requirements specified in clause 8.5.4 shall apply for each
TRP.

### 8.18.5 Requirements for SSB based candidate beam detection

#### 8.18.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the sets
${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$configured for a
serving cell, provided that the SSBs configured for candidate beam
detection (CBD) are actually transmitted within UE active DL BWP during
the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.18.5.2. The SSB(s) in
set ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ can be associated with an additional PCI
other than serving PCI.

#### 8.18.5.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured SSB resource in the two sets
${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$,estimated over the
last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_LR~ provided SSB\_RP and SSB ÃŠs/Iot are according to Annex table
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured SSB resources using the evaluation
period in table 8.18.5.2-1 and 8.18.5.2-2 corresponding to the non-DRX
mode, if the configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.18.5.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in table 8.18.5.2-2 for
FR2 with scaling factor N=8.

For UE supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* and is configured with one
or more per-UE periodic MUSIM gaps,

\- P value for an CBD SSB resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~SSB,~ SMTC period, MGRP\_max), where
MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE periodic MUSIM
gaps, per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement gaps within the
same FR as serving cell, and starting at the beginning of any configured
CBD SSB resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of configured CBD SSB resource occasions
within the window, including those overlapped with **MUSIM gap**
occasions or SMTC occasions within the window,

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of configured CBD SSB resource occasions
that are not overlapped with any **MUSIM gap** occasions within the
window W,

\- N~available~ is the number of configured CBD SSB resource occasions
that are not overlapped with any **non-dropped MUSIM gap** occasions nor
any SMTC occasion within the window W, and

> **- T~SSB~ is periodicity of the target** SSB resource for CBD**.**

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with configured
CBD SSB resource occasions, longer evaluation period would be expected.

Requirements in this clause do not apply when N~outside\ MG~ = 0 due to
fully overlapping between target SSB resource for CBD and MUSIM gap
occasions within the window W.

Otherwise, when UE is not configured with periodic MUSIM gap(s) or not
supporting MUSIM gap capability,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the SSB,

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the SSB.

For FR2,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with measurement gap
and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P is P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully
overlapped with SMTC period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~SSB~ =
0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{Min(MGRP,T_{\text{SMTCperiod}})}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is
partially or fully overlapped with measurement gap

\-
$P = \frac{P_{\text{sharing\ factor}}}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{\text{MGRP}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is partially
overlapped with measurement gap (T~SMTCperiod~ \< MGRP)

where,

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 1, if the candidate beam detection RS outside
measurement gap is

\- not overlapped with the SSB symbols indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure* and
1 data symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols indicated by
*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,
and;

\- not overlapped with the RSSI symbols indicated by
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol before each RSSI symbol
indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3, otherwise.

If the higher layer in TS 38.331 \[2\] signalling of *smtc2* is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc2*; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follows *smtc1.*
T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the same FR2
band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer evaluation period would be
expected during the period T~identify\_CGI~ when the UE is requested to
decode an NR CGI.

For either an FR1 or FR2 serving cell, longer CBD evaluation period
would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

The values of P~CBD~ used in table 8.18.5.2-1 and table 8.18.5.2-2 are
defined as

For each SSB resource in the sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ configured for PCell or PSCell in EN-DC or NE-DC
or SA; or PCell in NR-DC

\- P~CBD~ = 1.

For each SSB resource in the sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ configured for PSCell in NR-DC

\- P~CBD~ = 2 if UE is configured for candidate beam detection on SCell,
1 otherwise.

For each SSB resource in the sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ configured for a SCell

\- P~CBD~ = Z in EN-DC or NE-DC or SA.

\- P~CBD~ = 2\* Z in NR-DC.

Where Z is the number of band(s) on which UE is performing candidate
beam detection only for SCell

\- P~CBD~ is the number of band(s) on which UE is performing candidate
beam detection only for SCell.

The value of P~TRP~ used in table 8.18.5.2-2 is defined as 2, if
SSB/CSI-RS resource in the two sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and
${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ are overlapped, else it is 1.

#### 8.18.5.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based candidate beam detection

For FR1, when the SSB for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the
> SSB for CBD measurement without any restrictions.
>
> \- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,
>
> \- If UE supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE shall be
> able to measure the SSB for CBD measurement without any restriction.
>
> \- If UE does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, UE
> is required to measure one of but not both SSB for CBD measurement and
> CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD measurement is
> expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one of but
not both SSB for CBD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period
for SSB based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements are
defined. When the SSB and CSI-RS for CBD measurements are from different
sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$, UE shall be able
to measure both SSB and CSI-RS for CBD measurements.

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB with a different PCI for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to
measure one of but not both SSBs with the two different PCIs. Longer
measurement period for SSB based CBD measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2, if network configures same or mixed numerology between SSB for
CBD measurement on one FR2 band and CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD, L1-RSRP or
L1-SINR measurement on the other FR2 band, UE shall be able to perform
the related SSB based measurements in one band without any measurement
restrictions in the other band, provided that UE is capable of
independent beam management on this FR2 band pair.

For FR2, when the SSB for CBD measurementÂ ***in sets***
${\overline{q}}_{0,1}$ *or* ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ fully or partially
overlaps with the OFDM symbol as SSB for intra-frequency L1-RSRP
measurement or inter-frequency L1-RSRP measurement without gap on
candidate LTM neighbour cell on the same band, UE is required to measure
one of but not both SSBs. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

### 8.18.6 Requirements for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

#### 8.18.6.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
sets ${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ configured for a
serving cell, provided that the CSI-RS resources configured for
candidate beam detection are actually transmitted within UE active DL
BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.18.6.2.

#### 8.18.6.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the UE shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured CSI-RS resource in sets
${\overline{q}}_{1,0}$ and ${\overline{q}}_{1,1}$ estimated over the
last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_LR~ within T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ period provided CSI-RS ÃŠs/Iot
is according to Annex table B.2.4.2 for a corresponding band.

The UE shall monitor the configured CSI-RS resources using the
evaluation period in tables 8.18.6.2-1 and 8.18.6.2-2 corresponding to
the non-DRX mode, if the configured DRX cycle â‰¤ 320 ms.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.18.6.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in table 8.18.6.2-2 for
FR2 with scaling factor N=8.

For UE supporting *musim-GapPreference-r17* and is configured with one
or more per-UE periodic MUSIM gaps,

\- P value for an CBD CSI-RS resource to be measured is defined as

\- N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR1

\- P~sharing\ factor~ \* N~total~ / N~outside\_MG~ in FR2 with
N~available~ = 0

\- N~total~ / N~available~ in FR2 with N~available~ \> 0

\- For a window W of duration max(T~CSI-RS,~ SMTC period, MGRP\_max),
where MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE periodic
MUSIM gaps, per-UE measurement gaps and per-FR measurement gaps within
the same FR as serving cell, and starting at the beginning of any
configured CBD CSI-RS resource occasion:

\- N~total~ is the total number of configured CBD CSI-RS resource
occasions within the window, including those overlapped with **MUSIM
gap** occasions or SMTC occasions within the window,

\- N~outside\_MG~ is the number of configured CBD CSI-RS resource
occasions that are not overlapped with any **MUSIM gap** occasions
within the window W,

\- N~available~ is the number of configured CBD CSI-RS resource
occasions that are not overlapped with any **non-dropped MUSIM gap**
occasions nor any SMTC occasion within the window W, and

> **- T~CSI-RS~ is periodicity of the target** CSI-RS resource for
> CBD**.**

When the configured aperiodic MUSIM gap is overlapping with configured
CBD CSI-RS resource occasions, longer evaluation period would be
expected.

Requirements in this clause do not apply when N~outside\ MG~ = 0 due to
fully overlapping between target CSI-RS resource for CBD and MUSIM gap
occasions within the window W.

Otherwise, when UE is not configured with periodic MUSIM gap(s) or not
supporting MUSIM gap capability,

For FR1,

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$, when in the
monitored cell there are measurement gaps configured for
intra-frequency, inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements, which are
overlapping with some but not all occasions of the CSI-RS; and

\- P = 1 when in the monitored cell there are no measurement gaps
overlapping with any occasion of the CSI-RS.

For FR2,

\- P = 1, when candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with
measurement gap and also not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}}$ when candidate
beam detection RS is partially overlapped with measurement gap and
candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< MGRP)

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
candidate beam detection RS is not overlapped with measurement gap and
candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P =P~sharing\ factor~, when candidate beam detection RS is not
overlapped with measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is fully
overlapped with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\-
$P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{\text{MGRP}}\  - \ \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with
measurement gap and candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped
with SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~) and SMTC occasion is not
overlapped with measurement gap and

\- T~SMTCperiod~ â‰  MGRP or

\- T~SMTCperiod~ = MGRP and T~CSI-RS~ \< 0.5 Ã— T~SMTCperiod~

*SSB-ToMeasure* and 1 data symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols
indicated by *SSB-ToMeasure*, given that *SSB-ToMeasure* is configured,
where the *SSB-ToMeasure* is the union set of *SSB-ToMeasure*Â from all
the configured measurement objects merged on the same serving carrier,

indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement* and 1 data symbol after each RSSI
symbol indicated by *ss-RSSI-Measurement*, given that
*ss-RSSI-Measurement* is configured.

T~SMTCperiod~ is the shortest SMTC period among all CCs in the same FR2
band, provided the SMTC offset of all CCs in FR2 have the same offset.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for CBD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
CBD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
CBD-RS resource, SMTC occasion and measurement gap configurations does
not meet previous conditions.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the CSI-RS is on the same
OFDM symbols with RLM, BFD, BM-RS, or other CBD-RS, according to the

would be expected during the period T~identify\_CGI,E-UTRAN~ when the UE
is requested to decode an LTE CGI.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.19.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for a UE configured with PCell or
any activated SCell in standalone NR.

UE shall complete the activation/deactivation of pre-configured
measurement gap within the delay defined in this clause.

### 8.19.2 Pre-configured measurement gap activation/deactivation upon DCI/timer-based BWP switch

#### 8.19.2.1 Activation/deactivation upon DCI/timer-based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the
DCI/timer-based BWP switch is performed on a single CC with more than
one BWP configurations configured on the CC.

When BWP switch occurs, which results in status change of pre-configured
measurement gap according to clause 9.1.7, UE shall be able to finish
pre-configured measurement gap activation or deactivation within 5 ms
after the completion of the active BWP switch. The active BWP switch
delay for single CC is defined in clause 8.6.2. Activation/deactivation
of Pre-MG takes effect from the first complete MG occasion after the
activation and deactivation delay. If the end of activation/deactivation
of Pre-MG is within a Pre-MG gap occasion, the Pre-MG status shall not
be changed immediately. Instead, the Pre-MG status shall be changed
prior to the next Pre-MG gap occasion.

### 8.19.3 Pre-configured measurement gap activation/deactivation upon SCell activation/deactivation

The requirements in this clause apply when one SCell or multiple SCells
are activated/deactivated.

When one SCell or multiple SCells are activated/deactivated, which
results in status change of pre-configured measurement gap according to
clause 9.1.7, UE shall be able to finish pre-configured measurement gap
activation or deactivation within 5 ms after the completion of SCell(s)
activation/deactivation. The SCell(s) activation/deactivation delay for
is defined in clause 8.3. Activation/deactivation of Pre-MG takes effect
from the first complete MG occasion after the SCell(s)
activation/deactivation delay. If the end of activation/deactivation of
Pre-MG is within a Pre-MG gap occasion, the Pre-MG status shall not be
changed immediately. Instead, the Pre-MG status shall be changed prior
to the next Pre-MG gap occasion.

### 8.19.4 Pre-configured measurement gap activation/deactivation upon RRC reconfiguration

The requirements in this clause apply when UE is triggered by the RRC
based events defined in clause 9.1.7.3.1 if UE supports autonomous
activation/deactivation mechanism and/or in clause 9.1.7.3.2 if UE
supports network-controlled activation/deactivation mechanism.

If the aforementioned RRC reconfiguration results in status change of
pre-configured measurement gap according to clause 9.1.7, UE shall be
able to finish pre-configured measurement gap activation or deactivation
within 5 ms after RRC processing delay specified in \[2\]. If the end of
activation/deactivation of Pre-MG is within a Pre-MG gap occasion, the
Pre-MG status shall not be changed immediately. Instead, the Pre-MG
status shall be changed prior to the next Pre-MG gap occasion.

### 8.19.5 Activation/deactivation delay requirements for concurrent measurement gaps with Pre-MG

The requirements in this clause apply to a UE supporting
*concurrentMeasGapsPreMG-r18* and configured with concurrent measurement
gaps with Pre-MG.

#### 8.19.5.1 Activation/deactivation delay requirements for non-overlapped activation/deactivation of concurrent measurement gaps with Pre- MG

The requirements in this clause only apply when the
activation/deactivation procedures of the individual pre-configured
measurement gaps do not overlap in time.

When concurrent measurement gaps with Pre-MG activation/deactivation
procedure are non-overlapped upon DCI/timer-based BWP switch, upon SCell
activation/deactivation or upon RRC reconfiguration, for each individual
pre-configured measurement gap, the requirements defined in clauses
8.19.2, 8.19.3 and 8.19.4 apply.

#### 8.19.5.2 Activation/deactivation delay requirements for fully overlapped activation/deactivation of concurrent measurement gaps with Pre- MG

The requirements in this clause only apply when the
activation/deactivation procedures of the individual pre-configured
measurement gaps fully overlap in time.

Fully overlapped activation/deactivation of pre-configured measurement
gaps can occur in the following cases:

\- Both pre-configured measurement gaps are triggered by the same event.

\- Two pre-configured measurement gaps are triggered by two events of
the same type at the same time.

When concurrent measurement gaps with Pre-MG are activated/deactivated
simultaneously, the activation/deactivation delay equals the delay
requirements defined in clauses 8.19.2, 8.19.3, and 8.19.4 for
DCI/timer-based BWP switch, SCell activation/deactivation or RRC
reconfiguration triggered activation/deactivation, respectively, plus an
additional 2 ms post-processing time.

#### 8.19.5.3 Pre-MG activation/deactivation delay when colliding with a concurrent measurement gap

When the activation/deactivation procedure of a pre-configured
measurement gap collides with a concurrent measurement gap occasion, the
requirements defined in clause 9.1.12.4 apply.

The endpoint of Pre-MG activation/deactivation is equal to the
finalization of the pre-configured measurement gap
activation/deactivation as defined in clauses 8.19.2, 8.19.3 and 8.19.4
for DCI/timer-based BWP switch, SCell activation/deactivation or RRC
reconfiguration triggered activation/deactivation, respectively, without

### 8.19D.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for an ATG UE configured with
PCell in standalone NR.

UE shall complete the activation/deactivation of pre-configured
measurement gap within the delay defined in this clause.

### 8.19D.2 Pre-configured measurement gap activation/deactivation upon DCI/timer-based BWP switch

#### 8.19D.2.1 Activation/deactivation upon DCI/timer-based BWP switch delay on a single CC

The requirements in this clause shall apply only for FR1 and NR SA
operation mode without considering CA/DC and inter RAT measurement.

The requirements in this clause only apply to the case that the
DCI/timer-based BWP switch is performed on a single CC with more than
one BWP configurations configured on the CC.

When BWP switch occurs, which results in status change of pre-configured
measurement gap according to clause 9.1D.7, UE shall be able to finish
pre-configured activation or deactivation within 5 ms after the
completion of the active BWP switch. The active BWP switch delay for
single CC is defined in clause 8.6D.2. Activation/deactivation of Pre-MG
takes effect from the first complete MG occasion after the activation
and deactivation delay. If the end of activation/deactivation of Pre-MG
is within a gap occasion, the Pre-MG status shall not be changed
immediately. Instead, the Pre-MG status shall be changed prior to the
next gap occasion.

### 8.19D.3 Pre-configured measurement gap activation/deactivation upon RRC reconfiguration

The requirements in this clause shall apply only for FR1 and NR SA
operation mode without considering CA/DC and inter RAT measurement.

The requirements in this clause apply when UE capable of autonomous
activation/deactivation mechanism or network-controlled
activation/deactivation mechanism receives RRC reconfiguration to:

\- Add/remove of any measurement object(s), or

\- Switch active BWP or update parameters of its active BWP.

If the aforementioned RRC reconfiguration results in status change of
pre-configured measurement gap according to clause 9.1D.7, UE shall be
able to finish pre-configured activation or deactivation within 5 ms
after RRC processing delay specified in \[2\]. If the end of
activation/deactivation of Pre-MG is within a gap occasion, the Pre-MG
status shall not be changed immediately. Instead, the Pre-MG status
shall be changed prior to the next gap occasion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.24.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for a UE configured with
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* (if unifiedTCI-StateType is indicated as
*Joint*) or *TCI-UL-State* configurations for UL channels/signals on a
serving cell and when UE is configured two different values of
*CORESETPoolIndex* in ControlResourceSet. Further, the requirements
apply for a UE not configured with 2 TAs or for a UE configured with 2
TAs in FR1 or for a UE configured with 2 TAs in FR2 if RTD\<CP. Further
the requirements also apply for all the list of serving cells in
*simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList1, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2,
simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4* in MR-DC
or standalone NR provided all serving cells in the list are configured
with the same serving cell and BWP in *unifiedTCI-StateRef-r17*. There
is no requirement when the UE is requested to switch to a TCI state with
the higher layer parameter *TCI-UL-State* associated to SRS. UE shall
complete the switch of active uplink TCI state within the delay defined
in this clause when the UE is requested to switch to a TCI state with
the higher layer parameter *dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* or *TCI-UL-State*
associated to a DL RS. The requirements apply when UE is not expected to
receive simultaneously with multi-RX in FR2. The requirements are
applicable to each TRP independently.

PL-RS may be *associated with or included in* UL TCI state or joint TCI
state. The requirements in this clause shall apply if either of the
following conditions are met:

\- PL-RS is identical to source RS in UL TCI state or joint TCI state

\- PL-RS and source RS in UL TCI state or joint TCI state are QCL-Type D

When the target UL TCI state refers to an additional PCI different from
serving cell PCI in which this UL TCI state is configured, the
requirements in this clause are applicable provided that the following
conditions are met:

\- Active BWP of the serving cell and a cell with the additional PCI are
the same

\- Center frequency, SCS and SFN offset of a cell with the additional
PCI are as the same as serving cell

\- The cell with the additional PCI is known to the UE.

A cell with the additional PCI is known if the following conditions are
met:

\- During the last 5 s before L1-RSRP measurement is configured, the UE
has sent a valid L3 measurement report for the cell with the additional
PCI

\- Timing offset between serving cell and the cell with the additional
PCI is within CP of the corresponding SCS, except when UE supports
RTD\>CP with 2 TAs

In case that source RS in UL TCI state or joint TCI state is associated
with a PCI different from that of the serving cell, the requirements in
this clause shall apply if the cell with different PCI satisfies the
known cell condition defined in clause 8.24.1. If the known cell
condition is not met, longer delay may be expected.

In case of joint TCI state switch, UE is not expected to transmit on UL
based on the target TCI state before UE completes the DL and UL TCI
state switch.
