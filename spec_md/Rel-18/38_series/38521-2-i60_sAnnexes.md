A.2.3 Reference measurement channels for TDD
--------------------------------------------

For UL RMCs defined below, TDD slot pattern defined in Table A.2.3-1
will be used for the requirements requiring at least one sub frame (1ms)
for the measurement period. For other requirements, TDD slot patterns
defined for reference sensitivity tests in Table A.3.3.1-1 will be used.

A.3 DL reference measurement channels
=====================================

A.3.1 General
-------------

Unless otherwise stated, Tables A.3.3.2-1 and A.3.3.2-2 are applicable
for measurements of the Receiver Characteristics (clause 7).

Unless otherwise stated, Tables A.3.3.2-1 and A.3.3.2-2 also apply for
the modulated interferer used in Clauses 7.5 and 7.6 with test specific
bandwidths.

CSI-RS configuration parameter defined in A.3.1-2 is used for verifying
the beam correspondence requirement, 2 slots of CSI-RS shall be provided
at each test grid point. The DL channel shall be configured for zero
power on all tones except those used by CSI-RS in slots containing
CSI-RS for beam refinement, and the DL and UL channel sizes shall be the
same during verification.

The default downlink signal level uncertainty is +/- TBD dB, for any
level specified. If the uncertainty value is critical for the test
purpose, a tighter uncertainty is specified for the related test case in
Annex F.

For TRP measurement, DL signal may be supplied from RSRP based pathloss
compensation link. Downlink signal level using RSRP based pathloss
compensation link is specified in Table C.0-2 or Table C.0-3.

Table C.0-2: Downlink power levels for RSRP based pathloss compensation
link for TRP measurement for n257, n258 and n260

########  Annex D (normative): Characteristics of the interfering signal

D.1 General
===========

Unless otherwise stated, a modulated full bandwidth NR downlink signal,
which equals to channel bandwidth of the wanted signal for Single
Carrier case is used as interfering signals when RF performance
requirements for NR UE receiver are defined. For intra-band contiguous
CA case, a modulated NR downlink signal which equals to the aggregated
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal is used.

bandwidth options.

########  Annex E (normative): Global In-Channel TX-Test

NOTE: Clauses E.2.2 to E.5.9.3 are descriptions, which assume no power
ramping adjacent to the measurement period.

E.1 General
===========

The global in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

E.2 Signals and results
=======================

E.2.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of
the TX under test**, received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference
signal**, that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an
ideal error free received signal. All signals are represented as
equivalent (generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers as examples. These numbers are taken
from TDD with normal CP length and 100 MHz bandwidth with 60 kHz SCS.
The application of the text below, however, is not restricted to this
frame structure and bandwidth.

E.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling
rate of 122.88 Mbps. In the time domain it comprises at least 10 uplink
subframes. The measurement period is derived by concatenating the
correct number of individual uplink slots until the correct measurement
period is reached. The output signal is named z(ν). Each slot is
modelled as a signal with the following parameters: demodulated data
content, carrier frequency, amplitude and phase for each subcarrier,
timing, carrier leakage.

NOTE 1: TDD

Since the uplink subframes are not continuous, the *n* slots should be
extracted from more than 1 continuous radio frame where

![](./media/image3.emf){width="5.906944444444444in" height="0.5in"}.

E.2.3 Reference signal
----------------------

Two types of reference signal are defined:

The reference signal i~1~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following
parameters: demodulated data content, nominal carrier frequency, nominal
amplitude and phase for each subcarrier, nominal timing, no carrier
leakage. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a sampling rate
of 122.88 Mbps in the time domain.

The reference signal i~2~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following
parameters: restricted data content: nominal reference symbols, (all
modulation symbols for user data symbols are set to 0V), nominal carrier
frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,
nominal timing, no carrier leakage. It is represented as a sequence of
samples at a sampling rate of 122.88 Mbps in the time domain.

NOTE: The PUCCH is off during the time under test.

E.2.4 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the global in channel TX test are
the following:

\- Carrier Frequency error

\- EVM (Error Vector Magnitude)

\- Carrier leakage

\- Unwanted emissions, falling into non allocated resource blocks.

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

E.2.5 Measurement points
------------------------

The unwanted emission falling into non-allocated RB(s) is calculated
directly after the FFT as described below. In contrast to this, the EVM
for the allocated RB(s) is calculated after the IDFT for DFT-s-OFDM or
after the Tx-Rx chain equalizer for CP-OFDM. The samples after the TX-RX
chain equalizer are used to calculate EVM equalizer spectrum flatness.
Carrier frequency error and carrier leakage is calculated in the block
"RF correction".

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via
*txDirectCurrentLocation* IE (as defined in TS 38.331 \[6\]), carrier
leakage measurement in the RF correction block shall be omitted. All
statements from Annex E.3 onwards shall be read assuming that no carrier
leakage has been measured.

E.3 Signal processing
=====================

E.3.1 Pre FFT minimization process
----------------------------------

Before applying the pre-FFT minimization process, z(ν) and i(ν) are
portioned into *n* pieces, comprising one slot each, where *n* is as
defined in Annex E.2.2.

.

Each slot is processed separately. Sample timing, Carrier frequency and
carrier leakage in z(ν) are jointly varied in order to minimise the
difference between z(ν) and i(ν). Best fit (minimum difference) is
achieved when the RMS difference value between z(ν) and i(ν) is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation and the IQ variation are the measurement
results: Carrier Frequency Error and Carrier leakage.

From the acquired samples 10 carrier frequencies can be derived by
averaging frequency errors for every 4 or 8 slots for 60 and 120 kHz
SCS.

From the acquired samples *n* carrier frequencies and *n* carrier
leakages can be derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive carrier leakage and RF error
can be supported by Post FFT operations. However the minimisation
process defined in the pre FFT domain comprises all acquired samples
(i.e. it does not exclude the samples in between the FFT widths and it
does not exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth
configuration

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow deriving Carrier Frequency error and
Sample Frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for Sample Frequency error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinguish between both.

After this process the samples z(ν) are called z^0^(ν).

E.3.2 Timing of the FFT window
------------------------------

The FFT window length is 2048 samples per OFDM symbol. 14 FFTs (28672
samples) cover less than the acquired number of samples (30720 samples).
The position in time for FFT must be determined.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window W\<CP. There
are three different instants for FFT:

Centre of the reduced window, called , --W/2 and +W/2.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre FFT domain as
follows, using z^0^(ν) and i~2~(ν) :

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct boarders between the OFDM symbols and between Data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the Reference Signal i~2~(ν) the timing is known.

3\. Correlation between (1.) and (2.) will result in a correlation peak.
The meaning of the correlation peak is approx. the "impulse response" of
the TX filter. The meaning of "impulse response" assumes that the
autocorrelation of the reference signal i~2~(ν) is a Dirac peak and that
the correlation between the reference signal i~2~(ν) and the data in the
measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of
more than one, the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured
signal.

From the acquired samples, *n* timings can be derived.

For all calculations, except EVM, the number of samples in z^0^(ν) is
reduced to 14 blocks of samples, comprising 2048 samples (FFT width) and
starting with in each OFDM symbol including the demodulation reference
signal.

For the EVM calculation the output signal under test is reduced to 28
blocks of samples, comprising 2048 samples (FFT width) and starting with
--W/2 and +W/2 in each OFDM symbol including the demodulation reference
signal.

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to z^0^(ν). This
subset of samples is called z'(ν).

The timing of the centre with respect to the different CP length in a
slot is as follows: (TDD, normal CP length)

is on T~f~=72 (=CP/2) within the CP of length 144 FFT samples (in OFDM
symbols except 0 and 28 (=$7 \cdot 2^{\mu}$), where symbol 0 is the
first symbol of each subframe) for channel bandwidth of 100 MHz and SCS
= 60 kHz.

is on T~f~=136 (=208-72) within the CP of length 208 FFT samples (in
OFDM symbol 0 and 28 (=$7 \cdot 2^{\mu}$), where symbol 0 is the first
symbol of each subframe) for channel bandwidth of 100 MHz and SCS = 60
kHz.

E.3.3 Post FFT equalisation
---------------------------

Perform 14 FFTs on z'(ν), one for each OFDM symbol in a slot using the
timing , including the demodulation reference symbol. The result is an
array of samples, 14 in the time axis t times 2048 in the frequency axis
f. The samples represent the data symbols (in OFDM-symbol
0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13 in each slot) and demodulation reference
symbols (OFDM symbol 2, 7, 11 in each slot) in the allocated RBs and
inband emissions in the non allocated RBs within the transmission BW.

Only the allocated resource blocks in the frequency domain are used for
equalisation.

The nominal demodulation reference symbols and nominal data symbols are
used to equalize the measured data symbols. (Location for equalization
see Figure E.2.5-1)

NOTE: The nomenclature inside this note is local and not valid outside.

The nominal data symbols are created by a demodulation process. The
location to gain the demodulated data symbols is "EVM" in Figure
E.2.5-1. For CP-OFDM, the process described in Annex E.5 can be applied.
A demodulation process as follows is recommended for DFT-s-OFDM:

1\. Equalize the measured data symbols using the reference symbols for
equalisation. Result: Equalized data symbols

2\. Only for DFT-s-OFDM, iDFT transform the equalized data symbols:
Result: Equalized data symbols

3\. Decide for the nearest constellation point: Result: Nominal data
symbols

4\. Only for DFT-s-OFDM, DFT transform the nominal data symbols: Result:
Nominal data symbols

At this stage we have an array of [M]{.underline}easured
data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and reference-[S]{.underline}ymbols (MS(f,t))

versus an array of [N]{.underline}ominal data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and
reference [S]{.underline}ymbols (NS(f,t))

(complex, the arrays comprise 11 data symbols and 3 demodulation
reference symbol in the time axis and the number of allocated
subcarriers in the frequency axis.)

MS(f,t) and NS(f,t) are processed with a least square (LS) estimator, to
derive one equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated
subcarrier. EC(f) is defined as

![](./media/image6.png){width="2.348611111111111in"
height="0.48819444444444443in"}.

With \* denoting complex conjugation.

EC(f) are used to equalize the DFT-coded data symbols. The measured
DFT-coded data and the references symbols are equalized by:

Z'(f,t) = MS(f,t) **^.^** EC(f)

With **^.^** denoting multiplication.

Z'(f,t), restricted to the data symbol (excluding t=2,7,11) is used to
calculate EVM, as described in E.4.1.

EC(f) is used in E.4.4 to calculate EVM equalizer spectral flatness.

NOTE: The post FFT minimisation process is done over 14 symbols (11
DFT-coded data symbols and 3 reference symbols).

The samples of the non allocated resource blocks within the transmission
bandwidth configuration in the post FFT domain are called Y(f,t) (f
covering the non allocated subcarriers within the transmission bandwidth
configuration, t covering the OFDM symbols during 1 slot).

E.4 Derivation of the results
=============================

E.4.1 EVM
---------

For EVM create two sets of Z'(f,t)., according to the timing " --W/2 and
+W/2" using the equalizer coefficients from E.3.3.

Perform the iDFTs on Z'(f,t) in the case of DFT-s-OFDM waveform. The
IDFT-decoding preserves the meaning of t but transforms the variable f
(representing the allocated sub carriers) into another variable g,
covering the same count and representing the demodulated symbols. The
samples in the post IDFT domain are called iZ'(g, t). The equivalent
ideal samples are called iI(g,t). Those samples of Z'(f,t), carrying the
reference symbols (=symbol 2,7,11) are not iDFT processed.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal waveform and the measured
and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s)

,

where

t covers the count of demodulated symbols with the considered modulation
scheme being active within the measurement period, (i.e. symbol
0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13 in each slot, \|T\|=11)

g covers the count of demodulated symbols with the considered modulation
scheme being active within the allocated bandwidth. (\|G\|=12\* (with:
number of allocated resource blocks)).

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM.

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

From the acquired samples 2n EVM values can be derived, n values for the
timing --W/2 and n values for the timing +W/2

E.4.2 Averaged EVM
------------------

EVM is averaged over all basic EVM measurements.

The averaging comprises n UL slots

where

for PUCCH, PUSCH.

The averaging is done separately for timing¦ --W/2 and +W/2 leading

height="0.29097222222222224in"} is compared against the test
requirements.

E.4.3 In-band emissions measurement
-----------------------------------

The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the
non-allocated resources blocks.

Explanatory Note:

The inband emission measurement is only meaningful with allocated RB(s)
next to non-allocated RB. The allocated RB(s) are necessary but not
under test. The non allocated RBs are under test. The RB allocation for
this test is as follows: The allocated RB(s) are at one end of the
channel BW, leaving the other end unallocated. The number of allocated
RB(s) is smaller than half of the number of RBs, available in the
channel BW. This means that the vicinity of the carrier in the centre is
unallocated.

There are 3 types of inband emissions:

1\. General

2\. IQ image

3\. Carrier leakage

*Carrier leakage* are inband emissions next to the carrier.

*IQ image* are inband emissions symmetrically (with respect to the
carrier) on the other side of the allocated RBs.

*General* are applied to all unallocated RBs.

For each evaluated RB, the minimum requirement is calculated as the
higher of *P~RB\ ~*- 30 dB and the power sum of all limit values
(General, IQ Image or Carrier leakage) that apply.

In specific the following combinations:

\- Power (General)

\- Power (General + Carrier leakage)

\- Power (General + IQ Image)

1 and 2 is expressed in terms of power in one non allocated RB under
test, normalized to the average power of an allocated RB (unit dB).

3 is expressed in terms of power in one non allocated RB, normalized to
the power of all allocated RBs. (unit dBc).

This is the reason for two formulas *Emissions ~relative~*.

Create one set of Y(t,f) per slot according to the timing ""

For the non-allocated RBs below the in-band emissions are calculated as
follows

where RBnextDC means: Resource Block next to the carrier.

This can be one RB or one pair of RBs, depending whether the DC carrier
is inside an RB or in-between two RBs.

Although an exclusion period may be applicable in the time domain, when
evaluating EVM, the inband emissions measurement interval is defined
over one complete slot in the time domain.

From the acquired samples *n* functions for general in band emissions
and IQ image inband emissions can be derived. n values or n pairs of
carrier leakage inband emissions can be derived. They are compared
against different limits.

The in-band emissions are averaged over the *n* samples (equivalent to
10 UL subframes):

E.4.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness
-------------------------------------

For EVM equalizer spectrum flatness use EC(f) as defined in E.3.3. Note,
EC(f) represents equalizer coefficient ，f is the allocated subcarriers
within the transmission bandwidth ((\|*F*\|=12\*)

From the acquired samples n functions EC(f) can be derived.

EC(f) is broken down to 2 functions:

Where Range 1 and Range 2 are as defined in Table 6.5.2.4.5-1 for normal
condition and Table 6.5.2.4.5-2 for extreme condition

The following peak to peak ripple is calculated:

,which denote the maximum ripple in Range 2

,which denote the maximum ripple between the upper side of Range 1 and
lower side of Range 2

,which denote the maximum ripple between the upper side of Range 2 and
lower side of Range 1

E.4.5 Frequency error and Carrier leakage
-----------------------------------------

See E.3.1.

E.4.6 EVM of Demodulation reference symbols (EVM~DMRS~)
-------------------------------------------------------

For the purpose of EVM ~DMRS~, the steps E.2.2 to E.4.2 are repeated 6
times, constituting 6 EVM ~DMRS~ sub-periods. The only purpose of the
repetition is to cover the longer gross measurement period of EVM ~DMRS~
(![](./media/image44.png){width="0.3020833333333333in"
height="0.15138888888888888in"} time slots) and to derive the FFT window
timing per sub-period.

The bigger of the EVM results in one n TS period corresponding to the
timing¦ --W/2 or +W/2 is compared against the limit. (Clause E.4.2) This
timing is re-used for EVM ~DMRS~ in the equivalent EVM ~DMRS~
sub-period.

For EVM the demodulation reference symbols are excluded, while the data
symbols are used. For EVM~DMRS~ the data symbols are excluded, while the
demodulation references symbols are used. This is illustrated in figure
E.4.6-1

Figure E.4.6-1: EVM~DMRS~ measurement points

Re-use the following formula from E.3.3:

Z'(f,t) = MS(f,t) **^.^** EC(f)

To calculate EVM~DMRS~ , the data symbol ( t=0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13)
in Z'(f,t) are excluded and only the reference symbols (t=2,7,11) is
used.

The EVM ~DMRS~ is the difference between the ideal waveform and the
measured and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s)

,

where

t covers the count of demodulation reference symbols (i.e. symbols
2,7,11 in each slot, so count=3)

f covers the count of demodulation reference symbols within the
allocated bandwidth. (\|F\|=12\* (with: number of allocated resource
blocks)).

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM ~DMRS~

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

n such results are generated per measurement sub-period.

### E.4.6.1 1^st^ average for EVM ~DMRS~

EVM ~DMRS~ is averaged over all basic EVM ~DMRS~ measurements in one
sub-period

The averaging comprises n UL slots

![](./media/image49.png){width="2.6743055555555557in"
height="0.8138888888888889in"}

The timing is taken from the EVM for the data. 6 of those results are
achieved from the samples. In general the timing is not the same for
each result.

E.5 EVM and inband emissions for PUCCH
======================================

For the purpose of worst case testing, the PUCCH shall be located on the
edges of the Transmission Bandwidth Configuration (6,15,25,50,75,100
RBs).

The EVM for PUCCH (EVM~PUCCH~) is averaged over *n* slots, where

.

At least *n* TSs shall be transmitted by the UE without power change.
SRS multiplexing shall be avoided during this period. The following
transition periods are applicable: One OFDM symbol on each side of the
slot border (instant of band edge alternation).

The description below is generic in the sense that all 5 PUCCH formats
are covered. Although the number of OFDM symbols in one slot can be
different from 7 (depending on the format, configuration and cyclic
prefix length), the text below uses 7 without excluding the others.

E.5.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The basic principle is the same as described in E.2.1

E.5.2 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is processed same as described in
E.2.2

E.5.3 Reference signal
----------------------

The reference signal is defined same as in E.2.3. Same as in E.2.3,
i~1~(ν) is the ideal reference for EVM~PUCCH~ and i~2~(ν) is used to
estimate the FFT window timing.

Note PUSCH is off during the PUCCH measurement period.

E.5.4 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results are:

\- EVM~PUCCH~

\- Inband emissions with the sub-results: General in-band emission, IQ
image (according to: 38.101. Annex F.4, Clause starting with: "At this
stage the ....")

E.5.5 Measurement points
------------------------

The measurement points are illustrated in the Figure E.2.5-1.

E.5.6 Pre FFT minimization process
----------------------------------

The pre FFT minimisation process is the same as describes in clause
E.3.1.

NOTE: although an exclusion period for EVM~PUCCH~ is applicable in
E.5.9.1, the pre FFT minimisation process is done over the complete
slot.

RF error, and carrier leakage are necessary for best fit of the measured
signal towards the ideal signal in the pre FFT domain. However they are
not used to compare them against the limits.

E.5.7 Timing of the FFT window
------------------------------

Timing of the FFT window is estimated with the same method as described
in E.3.2.

E.5.8 Post FFT equalisation
---------------------------

The post FFT equalisation is described separately without reference to
E.3.3:

Perform 14 FFTs on z'(ν), one for each OFDM symbol in a slot using the
timing , including the demodulation reference symbol. The result is an
array of samples, 14 in the time axis t times 2048 in the frequency axis
f. The samples represent the OFDM symbols (data and reference symbols)
in the allocated RBs and inband emissions in the non allocated RBs
within the transmission BW.

Only the allocated resource blocks in the frequency domain are used for
equalisation.

The nominal reference symbols and **nominal** OFDM data symbols are used
to equalize the measured data symbols.

Note: (The nomenclature inside this note is local and not valid outside)

The nominal OFDM data symbols are created by a demodulation process. A
demodulation process as follows is recommended:

1\. Equalize the measured OFDM data symbols using the reference symbols
for equalisation. Result: Equalized OFDM data symbols

2\. Decide for the nearest constellation point, however not independent
for each subcarrier in the RB. 12 constellation points are decided
dependent, using the applicable CAZAC sequence. Result: Nominal OFDM
data symbols

At this stage we have an array of [M]{.underline}easured
data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and reference-[S]{.underline}ymbols (MS(f,t))

versus an array of [N]{.underline}ominal data-[S]{.underline}ymbols and
reference [S]{.underline}ymbols (NS(f,t))

The arrays comprise in sum 7 data and reference symbols, depending on
the PUCCH format, in the time axis and the number of allocated
sub-carriers in the frequency axis.

MS(f,t) and NS(f,t) are processed with a least square (LS) estimator, to
derive one equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated
subcarrier. EC(f)

With \* denoting complex conjugation.

EC(f) are used to equalize the OFDM data together with the demodulation
reference symbols by:

Z'(f,t) = MS(f,t) **^.^** EC(f)

With **^.^** denoting multiplication.

Z'(f,t) is used to calculate EVM~PUCCH~, as described in E.5.9 1

NOTE: although an exclusion period for EVM~PUCCH~ is applicable in
E.5.9.1, the post FFT minimisation process is done over 7 OFDM symbols.

The samples of the non allocated resource blocks within the transmission
bandwidth configuration in the post FFT domain are called Y(f,t) (f
covering the non allocated subcarriers within the transmission bandwidth
configuration, t covering the OFDM symbols during 1 slot).

E.5.9 Derivation of the results
-------------------------------

### E.5.9.1 EVM~PUCCH~

For EVM~PUCCH~ create two sets of Z'(f,t)., according to the timing "
--W/2 and +W/2" using the equalizer coefficients from E.5.8

The EVM~PUCCH~ is the difference between the ideal waveform and the
measured and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s)

,

where

the OFDM symbols next to transition boarders (instant of PUCCH frequency
hopping) are excluded:

t covers less than the count of demodulated symbols in the slot (\|T\|=
5)

f covers the count of subcarriers within the allocated bandwidth.
(\|F\|=12)

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM~PUCCH~

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

From the acquired samples 2*n* EVM~PUCCH~ value can be derived, *n*
values for the timing --W/2 and *n* values for the timing +W/2

### E.5.9.2 Averaged EVM~PUCCH~

EVM~PUCCH~ is averaged over all basic EVM~PUCCH~ measurements

The averaging comprises *n* UL slots

![](./media/image55.png){width="2.7090277777777776in"
height="0.8486111111111111in"}

The averaging is done separately for timing¦ --W/2 and +W/2 leading to
and

is compared against the test requirements.

### E.5.9.3 In-band emissions measurement

The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the
non-allocated resources blocks

Create one set of Y(t,f) per slot according to the timing ""

For the non-allocated RBs the in-band emissions are calculated as
follows

,

where

the upper formula represents the inband emissions below the allocated
frequency block and the lower one the inband emissions above the
allocated frequency block.

is a set of OFDM symbols in the measurement period,

is the starting frequency offset between the allocated RB and the
measured non-allocated RB (e.g. for the first upper or for the first
lower adjacent RB),

and are the lower and upper edge of the UL system BW,

and are the lower and upper edge of the allocated BW,

is the SCS, and

is the frequency domain signal evaluated for in-band emissions as
defined in the subsection E.5.8

The relative in-band emissions are, given by

where

is the number of allocated RBs,

and is the frequency domain samples for the allocated bandwidth, as
defined in the subsection E.5.8

Although an exclusion period for EVM is applicable in E.5.9.1, the
inband emissions measurement interval is defined over one complete slot
in the time domain.

From the acquired samples *n* functions for inband emissions can be
derived.

The in-band emissions are averaged over the *n* samples (equivalent to
10 UL subframes) with the same PUCCH position to prevent averaging of
allocated and non-allocated RBs due to PUCCH frequency hopping:

Since the PUCCH allocation is always on the upper or lower band-edge,
the opposite of the allocated one represents the IQ image, and the
remaining inner RBs represent the general inband emissions. They are
compared against different limits.

E.5.10 Modified signal under test
---------------------------------

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments.

The DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals or PRACH signal under test is modified
and, in the case of DFT-s-OFDM modulated signals, decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

The CP-OFDM modulated signals or PUSCH demodulation reference signal or
CP-OFDM modulated signalsunder test is equalised and, in the case of
PUCCH data signal decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

To minimize the error, the signal under test should be modified with
respect to a set of parameters following the procedure explained below.

Notation:

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length (defined in the next clauses) or the last sample of the first
window half if is even.

The EVM analyser shall

\- detect the start of each slot and estimate and ,

\- determine so that the EVM window of length is centred

\- on the time interval determined by the measured cyclic prefix minus
16κ samples of the considered OFDM symbol for symbol l for subcarrier
spacing configuration µ in a subframe, with l = 0 or l = 7\*2\^µ for
normal CP, i.e. the first 16κ samples of the CP should not be taken into
account for this step. In the determination of the number of excluded
samples, a sampling rate of 1/T~c~ is assumed. If a different sampling
rate is used, the number of excluded samples is scaled linearly.

\- on the measured cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol symbol
for all other symbols for normal CP and for symbol 0 to 11 for extended
CP.

\- on the measured preamble cyclic prefix for the PRACH

To determine the other parameters a sample timing offset equal to is
corrected from the signal under test. The EVM analyser shall then

\- correct the RF frequency offset for each time slot, and

\- apply an FFT of appropriate size. The chosen FFT size shall ensure
that in the case of an ideal signal under test, there is no measured
inter-subcarrier interference.

The carrier leakage shall be removed from the evaluated signal before
calculating the EVM and the in-band emissions; however, the removed
relative carrier leakage power also has to satisfy the applicable
requirement.

At this stage the allocated RBs shall be separated from the
non-allocated RBs. In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH EVM, the signal on the
non-allocated RB(s), , is used to evaluate the in-band emissions.

Moreover, the following procedure applies only to the signal on the
allocated RB(s).

\- In the case of PUCCH and PUSCH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate
the TX chain equalizer coefficients and used by the ZF equalizer for all
subcarriers by time averaging at each signal subcarrier of the amplitude
and phase of the reference and data symbols. The time-averaging length
is 1 slot. This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
signal subcarrier used by the ZF equalizer. The knowledge of data
modulation symbols may be required in this step because the
determination of symbols by demodulation is not reliable before signal
equalization.

\- In the case of PRACH, the UL EVM analyzer shall estimate the TX chain
coefficients and used for phase and amplitude correction and are seleted
so as to minimize the resulting EVM. The TX chain coefficients are not
dependent on frequency, i.e. and . The TX chain coefficient are chosen
independently for each preamble transmission and for each .

At this stage estimates of , , and are available. is one of the
extremities of the window , i.e. can be or , where if is odd and if is
even. The EVM analyser shall then

\- calculate EVM~l~ with set to ,

\- calculate EVM~h~ with set to .

E.6 EVM for PRACH
=================

The description below is generic in the sense that all PRACH formats are
covered. The numbers, used in the text below are taken from PRACH format
B4 without excluding the other formats. The sampling rate for the PUSCH,
122.88 Mbps in the time domain, is re-used for the PRACH. The carrier
spacing of the PUSCH is up to 48 times higher than that of PRACH
depending on the PRACH format and SCS. This results in an oversampling
factor *ovf* of up to 48, when acquiring the time samples for the PRACH.
The pre-FFT algorithms (clauses E.6.6 and E.6.7) use all time samples,
although oversampled. For the FFT the time samples are decimated by the
*ovf*, resulting in the same FFT size as for the other transmit
modulation tests. Decimation requires a decision, which samples are used
and which ones are rejected. The algorithm in E.6.6, Timing of the FFT
window, can also be used to decide about the used samples.

E.6.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The basic principle is the same as described in E.2.1

E.6.2 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is processed same as described in
E.2.2

The measurement period is different since 2 PRACH preambles are recorded
for long preamble formats as defined in Table 6.3.3.1-1 in \[9\] and 10
preambles are recorded for short preamble formats as defined in Table
6.3.3.1-2 in \[9\].

E.6.3 Reference signal
----------------------

The test description in 6.4.2.1.4.1 is based on non-contention based
access:

\- PRACH configuration index (responsible for Preamble format, System
frame number and subframe number)

\- Preamble ID

\- Preamble power

signalled to the UE, defines the reference signal unambiguously, such
that no demodulation process is necessary to gain the reference signal.

The reference signal i(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following
parameters: the applicable Zadoff Chu sequence, nominal carrier
frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier, nominal
timing, no carrier leakage. It is represented as a sequence of samples
at a sampling rate of 122.88 Mbps in the time domain.

E.6.4 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement result is:

\- EVMPRACH

E.6.5 Measurement points
------------------------

The measurement points are illustrated in the figure below:

![](./media/image83.png){width="6.290972222222222in" height="1.91875in"}

Figure E.6.5-1: Measurement points

E.6.6 Pre FFT minimization process
----------------------------------

The pre-FFT minimization process is applied to each PRACH preamble
separately. The time period for the pre- FFT minimisation process
includes the complete CP and Zadoff-Chu sequence (in other words, the
power transition period is per definition outside of this time period)
Sample timing, Carrier frequency and carrier leakage in z(ν) are jointly
varied in order to minimise the difference between z(ν) and i(ν). Best
fit (minimum difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value
between z(ν) and i(ν) is an absolute minimum.

After this process the samples z(ν) are called z^0^(ν).

RF error, and carrier leakage are necessary for best fit of the measured
signal towards the ideal signal in the pre FFT domain. However they are
not used to compare them against the limits.

E.6.7 Timing of the FFT window
------------------------------

The FFT window length is 81922*^-^* samples for preamble format B4,
however in the measurement period at least 119362*^-^*samples are taken
where ![](./media/image84.wmf){width="0.6743055555555556in"
height="0.24444444444444444in"}. The position in time for FFT must be
determined.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window W\<CP.

The reference instant for the FFT start is the centre of the reduced
window, called ,

EVM is measured at the following two instants: --W/2 and +W/2.

The timing of the measured signal z^0^(ν) with respect to the ideal
signal i(ν) is determined in the pre FFT domain as follows:

Correlation between z^0^(ν) and i(ν) will result in a correlation peak.
The meaning of the correlation peak is approx. the "impulse response" of
the TX filter. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more
than one, the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal with
respect to the ideal signal.

W is different for different preamble formats and shown in Table E.6.7-1
for ![](./media/image86.wmf){width="0.6395833333333333in"

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to z^0^(ν). This
subset of samples is called z''(ν).

The sample frequency 122.88 MHz is oversampled with respect to the
PRACH-subcarrier spacing of
![](./media/image87.wmf){width="1.1277777777777778in"
height="0.25555555555555554in"}. EVM is based on 81922*^-^* samples per

preamble, used for FFT is reduced compared to z^''^(ν) by the same

E.6.8 Post FFT equalisation
---------------------------

Equalisation is not applicable for the PRACH.

E.6.9 Derivation of the results
-------------------------------

### E.6.9.1 EVM~PRACH~

Perform FFT on z'(ν) and i(ν) using the FFT timing --W/2 and +W/2.

For format B4 the first and the repeated preamble sequence are
FFT-converted separately using the standard FFT length of 8192.

The EVM~PRACH~ is the difference between the ideal waveform and the
measured and equalized waveform for the allocated RB(s).

where

t covers the count of demodulated symbols in the slot.

f covers the count of demodulated symbols within the allocated
bandwidth.

are the samples of the signal evaluated for the EVM~PRACH~

is the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment, and

is the average power of the ideal signal. For normalized modulation
symbols is equal to 1.

From the acquired samples 2*m* EVM~PRACH~ values can be derived, *m*
values for the timing --W/2 and *m* values for the timing +W/2.

### E.6.9.2 Averaged EVM~PRACH~

The PRACH EVM, , is averaged over *m* preamble sequence measurements.

where *m* is the number of recorded preambles as defined in Annex E.6.2.

The averaging is done separately for timing¦ --W/2 and +W/2 leading to
and

is compared against the test requirements.

E.6.10 Modified signal under test
---------------------------------

Same as Annex E.5.10 and applies to EVM measurements on PRACH.

E.6.11 Phase offset measurement for DMRS bundling
-------------------------------------------------

### E.6.11.1 Measurement point

The measurement point for phase offset measurement is defined in Figure
F.8.1-1.

Figure F.8.1-1: Measurement point for phase offset for DMRS bundling

### E.6.11.2 Symbols used

Phase offset is determined based on DMRS REs (3 DMRS symbols per slot)
with the option to use data symbols.

### E.6.11.3 Modified test signal

Same as described in Annex E.5.10 and Annex E.6.10.

### E.6.11.4 Phase offset measurement

The phase offset measurement is based on the phase response of the Tx
chain as derived based on Annex F.4.

The subcarrier at the carrier leakage frequency of the transmitted
signal shall be excluded from the measured subcarriers.

The phase difference
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)\ $for each measured
subcarrier between a reference timeslot t~ref~ and the measurement
timeslot t~m~ is then calculated as defined below:

$$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \ \widetilde{\varphi}\left( t_{m},f \right) - \widetilde{\varphi}(t_{\text{ref}},f)$$

The phase offset between the reference and measurement timeslots are
then calculated as the maximum over the results for all measured
subcarriers as shown below:

$$PhaseOffset = \max_{f}{(\left| \mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) \right|)}$$

E.7 EVM for dual transmit polarizations
---------------------------------------

###  E.7.1 General

A zero-forcing (ZF) MIMO receiver architecture is used so that
transmissions by the UE, which are received by the test equipment on two
polarizations, can be demodulated by the test equipment receiver.

![X:\\PROJECT\\CMW\\DEVELOP\\USER\\1CM5\\KRAKOWSK\\NR\\NR\_EVM\_2L\_UL\_MIMO.png](./media/image98.png){width="6.5375in"
height="3.248611111111111in"}

Figure E.7.1-1: EVM calculation block diagram for 2-Layer UL MIMO

The TE receives signals from 2 different ports on two antenna
polarizations in the test system.

For UL MIMO measurements a MIMO equalization step as described in
section E.7.2 is performed to separate the layers.

For single layer transmissions received on two polarizations the MIMO
equalization step as described in section E.7.2 is replaced by a maximum
ratio combining step as described in section E.7.3.

Each layer is then processed as described in section E.7.4 to receive
the measurement results for each individual layer.

###  E.7.2 MIMO Equalization (UL MIMO transmission)

The MIMO equalization is based only on reference signals (DMRS) without
using any data symbols. For the equalization process all available DMRS
symbols shall be used.

The effective 2x2 channel matrix is estimated using reference signals of
different subcarriers, e.g. in case of DMRS antenna ports 0 and 2. In
case that same subcarriers are used, e.g. DMRS antenna ports 0 and 1, a
channel decomposition is necessary taking advantage of the orthogonal
codes *w~f~* and *w~t~* and assuming identical channel coefficients for
adjacent subcarriers of same CDM group.

Effective channel including the precoding matrix *P* is:

$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix}
{\widetilde{h}}_{0,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{0,1} \\
{\widetilde{h}}_{1,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{1,1} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

with

$${\widetilde{h}}_{n,\nu} = \frac{y_{n}r_{\nu}^{*}}{{|r_{\nu}|}^{2}}$$

where *y* denotes the received symbol on port index *n* and *r* the
reference signal for layer index *ν*.

Since reference signals of a specific layer are transmitted only on
subcarriers of one CDM group channel, interpolation is needed in order
to obtain channel coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel
interpolation is done using the channel coefficients of active CDM group
in all other CDM groups.

The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients
are obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing
the moving average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving
average window size is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of
allocation the window size is reduced accordingly.

The ZF equalizer coefficients are calculated as the inverse of the
effective channel matrix, in general:

$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{- 1}$

###  E.7.3 Maximum Ratio combining (Tx diversity transmission)

The maximum ratio combining is based only on reference signals (DMRS)
without using any data symbols. For the equalization process all
available DMRS symbols shall be used.

The effective 2x1 channel matrix is estimated using reference signals of
different subcarriers. In case of transmit diversity, the effective
channel includes the precoding matrix *P*:

$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix}
{\widetilde{h}}_{0} \\
{\widetilde{h}}_{1} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

with

$${\widetilde{h}}_{n} = \frac{y_{n}r^{*}}{{|r|}^{2}}$$

where *y* denotes the received symbol on port index *n* and *r* the
reference signal.

Since reference signals are transmitted only on subcarriers of one CDM
group, channel interpolation is needed in order to obtain channel
coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done using
the channel coefficients of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.

The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients
are obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing
the moving average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving
average window size is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of
allocation the window size is reduced accordingly.

The ZF equalizer coefficients for maximum ratio combining are calculated
as pseudo inverse of effective channel, in general:

$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{+} = {({\widetilde{H}}^{H}\widetilde{H})}^{- 1}{\widetilde{H}}^{H}$

###  E.7.4 Layer processing

After performing either the MIMO equalization or maximum ratio combining
as described in section E.7.2 or E.7.3 respectively, each layer is
processed using the existing procedure as defined in Annex E.

Since the channel estimation is calculated only on the DMRS symbols, an
averaging including all 14 symbols of one slot, i.e. data and reference
signals, is needed in order to minimize EVM. The averaging is achieved
by the least square (LS) equalization method described for single layer
in Annex E.3.

*MS(f,t)* and *NS(f,t)* are processed with a LS estimator, to derive one
equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated subcarrier.
*EC(f)* is defined for each layer as:

$\text{EC}_{\nu}(f) = \frac{\sum_{t = 0}^{13}{\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)^{*}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}{\sum_{t = 0}^{13}{MS_{\nu}(f,t)^{*}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}$

With \* denoting complex conjugation. *EC(f)* are used to equalize layer
data symbols.

EVM equalizer spectral flatness is derived from equalizer coefficients
for each layer as follows:

$c_{\nu} = \left| \text{EC}_{\nu}(f) \right|\ \sqrt{\left| g_{\nu,0} \right|^{2} + \left| g_{\nu,1} \right|^{2}}$

########  Annex F (normative): Measurement uncertainties and Test Tolerances

F.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System (normative)
=====================================================

F.1.0 General
-------------

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
range, and the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty
not exceeding the specified values. Care should be taken to ensure that
each conformance test implementation including the OTA chamber aspects
meets the specified measurement uncertainty for each test case by
requiring the test laboratory to maintain a detailed measurement
uncertainty test report showing compliance to all the measurement
uncertainty requirements. The detailed measurement uncertainty report
would contain the justification for each measurement uncertainty
component and its value and distribution. The derivation of these values
is based on the minimum conformance requirements plus relaxation, i.e.,
test tolerance is not to be considered. All ranges and uncertainties are
absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless
otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

The downlink signal uncertainties apply at the defined quiet zone with
the UE properly positioned in the quiet zone. The uplink signal
uncertainties apply at the measurement equipment with the UE positioned
properly in the quiet zone.

F.1.1 Measurement of test environments
--------------------------------------

Editor's note: Various measurement accuracies for UE test environments,
e.g., pressure, relative humidity, DC&AC voltage, vibration, and
vibration frequency, are FFS:

The measurement accuracy of the UE test environments defined in TS
38.508-1 \[5\] subclause 4.1, Test environments shall be

\- Temperature ±4 degrees.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

F.2 Interpretation of measurement results (normative)
=====================================================

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in clause F.1
of the present document.

If the Test System using one of the permitted test methods defined in
TR38.903 \[20\] for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause F.1, it is still permitted to use
this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made value as follows:

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause F.1 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests, for example receiver
tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure
will ensure that a Test System not compliant with clause F.1does not
increase the chance of passing a device under test where that device
would otherwise have failed the test if a Test System compliant with
clause F.1 had been used.

F.3 Test Tolerance and Derivation of Test Requirements (informative)
====================================================================

F.3.1 Measurement of test environments
--------------------------------------

TBD

F.3.2 Measurement of transmitter
--------------------------------

Editor's note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Influence of noise is subtracted from MTSU before calculating the TT
    for lower limit Tx test cases.

########  Annex H (normative): Statistical Testing

H.1 General
===========

This annex specifies mapping throughput to error ratio, pass fail limits
and pass fail decision rules that are needed for measuring average
throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance
for testing receiver characteristics.

H.2 Statistical testing of receiver characteristics
===================================================

H.2.1 General
-------------

The test of receiver characteristics is twofold.

1\. A signal or a combination of signals is offered to the RX port(s) of
the receiver.

2\. The ability of the receiver to demodulate /decode this signal is
verified by measuring the throughput.

In (2) is the statistical aspect of the test and is treated here.

The minimum requirement for all receiver tests is \>95% of the maximum
throughput.

All receiver tests are performed in static propagation conditions. No
fading conditions are applied.

H.2.2 Mapping throughput to error ratio
---------------------------------------

a\) The measured information bit throughput R is defined as the sum (in
kilobits) of the information bit payloads successfully received during
the test interval, divided by the duration of the test interval (in
seconds).

b\) In measurement practice the UE indicates successfully received
information bit payload by signalling an ACK to the SS.\
If payload is received, but damaged and cannot be decoded, the UE
signals a NACK.

c\) Only the ACK and NACK signals, not the data bits received, are
accessible to the SS.\
The number of bits is known in the SS from knowledge of what payload was
sent.

d\) For the reference measurement channel, applied for testing, the
number of bits is different in different slots, however in a radio frame
it is fixed during one test.

e\) The time in the measurement interval is composed of successfully
received slots (ACK), unsuccessfully received slots (NACK) and no
reception at all (DTX-slots).

f\) DTX-slots may occur regularly according the applicable reference
measurement channel (regDTX).\
In real live networks this is the time when other UEs are served. In TDD
these are the UL and special slots.\
regDTX vary from test to test but are fixed within the test.

g\) Additional DTX-slots occur statistically when the UE is not
responding ACK or NACK where it should. (statDTX)\
This may happen when the UE was not expecting data or decided that the
data were not intended for it.

The pass / fail decision is done by observing the:

\- number of NACKs

\- number of ACKs and

\- number of statDTXs (regDTX is implicitly known to the SS)

The ratio (NACK + statDTX)/(NACK+ statDTX + ACK)is the Error Ratio (ER).
Taking into account the time consumed by the ACK, NACK, and DTX-TTIs
(regular and statistical), ER can be mapped unambiguously to throughput
for any single reference measurement channel test.

H.2.3 Design of the test
------------------------

The test is defined by the following design principles (see clause H.
2.6, Theory....):

1\. The early decision concept is applied.

2\. A second limit is introduced: Bad DUT factor M\>1

3\. To decide the test pass:

Supplier risk is applied based on the Bad DUT quality

To decide the test fail

Customer Risk is applied based on the specified DUT quality

The test is defined by the following parameters:

1\. Limit ER = 0.05 (Throughput limit = 95%)

2\. Bad DUT factor M=1.5 (selectivity)

3\. Confidence level CL = 95% (for specified DUT and Bad DUT-quality)

H.2.5 Pass fail decision rules
------------------------------

The pass fail decision rules apply for a single test, comprising one
component in the test vector. The overall Pass /Fail conditions are
defined in clause H.2.6and H.2A.6

Having observed 0 errors, pass the test at 67+ samples, otherwise
continue

Having observed 1 error, pass the test at 67+ samples, otherwise
continue

Having observed 2 errors, pass the test at 95+ samples, otherwise
continue

Etc. etc.

Having observed 145 errors, pass the test at 2349+ samples, fail the
test at 2345- samples, otherwise continue

Having observed 146 errors, pass the test at 2364+ samples, fail the
test at 2363- samples.

Where x+ means: x or more, x- means x or less

NOTE 1: an ideal DUT passes after 67 samples. The maximum test time is
2364 samples.

NOTE 2: It is allowed to deviate from the early decision concept by
postponing the decision (pass/fail or continue). Postponing the decision
to or beyond the end of Table H.2.4-1 requires a pass fail decision
against the test limit: pass the DUT for ER\<0.0618, otherwise fail.

H.2.6 Theory to derive the pass fail limits (Informative)
---------------------------------------------------------

Editor\'s note: This clause of the Annex H is for information only and
it describes the background theory and information for statistical
testing.

### H.2.6.1 Numerical definition of the pass-fail limits

A statistical test is characterized by test time, selectivity and
confidence level. The outcome of the statistical test is a decision.
This decision may be correct, i.e., DUTs whose throughput is less than
95% maximum throughput being declared to fail, and DUTs whose throughput
is higher or equal to 95% being declared to pass, or in-correct with
oppsite decision. The Confidence Level (CL) describes the probability
that the decision is a correct one. The complement is the wrong decision
probability (risk) D = 1-CL.

As described in H.2.2, the measurement of throughput could be mapped to
ER (Error Ratio). When testing ER, transport blocks or \"samples\" are
observed and the number of correctly and erroneously received blocks are
recorded. For a \"standard\" test, a pre-defined number of samples are
observed, and a pass/fail decision is made based on the number of
observed errors being above/below a threshold. This threshold is based
on the targeted throughput or BLER and the design target CL. There is
always some risk of a statistical variation leading to an incorrect
pass/fail decision. The greater the number of samples that are recorded,
the lower is the risk of such an error. The number of samples that are
observed in a standard test is dimensioned to achieve an acceptable low
risk of error (i.e., an acceptable high confidence level) for DUTs that
just meet the specified limit.

The standard test works well where the target ER level is relatively
high and confidence level relatively low (both are chosen to be on a
comparable order of magnitude). However, for relatively low ER testing
the length of time required for observing sufficient samples to achieve
a 95% confidence level is excessive. In many cases, the DUTs will in
fact have a much lower true ER level than the target ER level, (in which
case, the number of samples needed to achieve high confidence that the
true ER level is lower than the limit is much smaller). On the other
hand, a bad DUT which is expected to fail the requirement might have a
much higher true ER level (in which case, errors occur more frequently
and it can be demonstrated that the DUT is above the target ER limit
with fewer samples).

To avoid long test time, an alternative test method called early
pass/fail is adopted. With the early pass/fail, each time a block error
is encountered, a decision is made on whether the DUT can be
passed/failed with 95% CL or the test needs to continue until another
error is encountered. In the case of very good DUTs, the test can also
be passed, when the number of samples permissible for one error event is
reached and no error event is recorded. Pass/Fail is decided based on
the total number of observed samples and errors, and a statistical
calculation based on an inverse binomial cumulative distribution. The
calculation involves one parameter, one variable and the result:

\- Parameter: d (per step decision probability).

\- Variable: ne (number of observed errors).

\- Result: ns (number of expected samples for pass/fail, depending on
which one is calculated).

The per step decision probability risk, d, expresses the probability of
making an incorrect pass/fail decision in the current step (i.e., for
the current decision coordinate). d is determined by simulation such
that the overall risk of making a wrong decision over all steps of each
test of a large number of tests on a large number of DUTs that exactly
meet the target ER limit is D=5% (and hence the CL 95%).

It should be noted that d is determined separately considering early
pass and early fail testing.

For a marginal DUT (i.e., a DUT almost exactly meeting the target ER
level), the unmodified early pass/early fail approach is unable to
distinguish whether the DUT has just passed or just failed the BLER
(ε→0), and can thus terminate with an \"undecided\" result. To avoid
this undecided result and provide selectivity, a so-called \"bad device
factor\" (M) is introduced into the early pass calculation. This factor
biases the decision towards avoiding failing good DUT.

### H.2.6.2 Simulation to derive the pass-fail limits for testing 95% throughput

As per the description in H.2.2, the 95% throughput measurement is
mapped to ER=0.05, where ER is (NACK + statDTX)/(NACK+ statDTX + ACK).

The binomial distribution and its inverse are used to design the pass
and fail limits. Note that this method is not unique and that other
methods exist.

\- pass(..) is the error ratio for the pass limit.

\- ER is the specified error ratio 5%.

\- ne is the number of bad results. This is the variable in both
equations.

\- M is the Bad DUT factor M=1.5.

\- d~f~ is the wrong decision probability of a single (ne, ns)
co-ordinate for the fail limit.\
It is found by simulation to be d~f~ = 0.006.

\- cl~p~ is the confidence level of a single (ne, ns) co-ordinate for
the pass limit.\
It is found by simulation to be cl~p~ = 0.9945.

\- qnbinom(..): The inverse cumulative function of the negative binomial
distribution.

The simulation works as follows:

\- A large population of limit DUTs with true ER = 0.05 is decided
against the pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (95 %) of the population passes
and D (5 %) of the population fails.

\- A population of Bad DUTs with true ER = M\*0.05 is decided against
the same pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (95 %) of the population fails
and D (5 %) of the population passes.

\- The number of DUTs decrease during the simulation, as the decided
DUTs leave the population. That number decreases with an approximately
exponential characteristics. After 146 bad results all DUTs of the
population are decided.

NOTE: The exponential decrease of the population is an optimal design
goal for the decision co-ordinates (ne, ns), which can be achieved with
other formulas or methods as well.

########  Annex K (normative): EIRP, TRP, and EIS measurement procedures

Annex K defines the EIRP, TRP, and EIS measurement procedures which
includes Tx and Rx beam peak direction search, spherical coverage
procedures and TRP procedures for the permitted testing methodologies
defined in \[5\].

The default value for BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME = 3 sec for all
applicable Tx and Rx test cases. The BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME represents
a default minimum wait time period required to complete beam selection
process at a single position before start of measurement. For a
particular EUT, if it is known/determined that a lower wait time than
default value is enough to complete beam selection process, then such a
lower value may be used by the Test system to achieve test time
optimization.

K.1 Direct far field (DFF)
==========================

K.1.1 TX beam peak direction search
-----------------------------------

This Tx beam peak search procedure applies to DUTs with and without
support of *beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping*. The TX beam peak
direction is found with a 3D EIRP scan (separately for each orthogonal
downlink polarization). The TX beam peak direction search grid points
for this single grid approach are defined in Annex M.2.1. Alternatively,
a coarse and fine grid approach could be used according to the
definition in Annex M.2.2.

The beam peak searches shall be performed for every test frequency range
by default unless the device manufacturer explicitly declares that the
beam peak at the mid test frequency range is applicable for the
remaining (low, high) test frequency ranges. Beam peak search results
cannot be re-used across different bands that do not overlap. Beam peak
search results can be re-used from bands that completely contain the
target bands if explicitly declared with a declaration.

A beam peak search shall be performed for every intra-band contiguous
combination and CA BW class by default unless the device manufacturer
explicitly declares that the beam peak for a reference (frequency band,
CBW) or (frequency band combination, CA BW class) is applicable for a
group of other intra-band contiguous combinations and CA BW classes.

The beam peak searches shall be performed for every modulation by
default unless the device manufacturer explicitly declares that the beam
peak at the QPSK modulation is applicable for the remaining 16QAM and
64QAM modulations.

The beam peak searches shall be performed for every waveform by default
unless the device manufacturer explicitly declares that the beam peak
from one waveform is applicable for the other waveform.

The beam peak searches shall be performed separately for NTC (Normal),
ETC (TL), and ETC (TH).

The beam peak search results from single carrier can be re-used for UL
MIMO testing.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) Position the DUT in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables N.2-1 through
N.2-7 \[3\].

3\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=θ polarization to form the TX beam
towards the measurement antenna. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
for the UE TX beam selection to complete.

4\) Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands in every
uplink scheduling information to the UE; allow at least 200 msec
starting from the first TPC Command in this step for the UE to reach
P~UMAX~ level. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME for the UE Tx
beam selection to complete.

5\) Through its beam correspondence procedure, DUT refines its TX beam
toward that direction depending on DUT's beam correspondence capability
which shall match OEM declaration:

\- If the DUT's beam correspondence capability
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is supported, then DUT
autonomously chooses the corresponding TX beam for PUSCH transmission
using downlink reference signals to transmit in the direction of the
incoming DL signal, which is based on beam correspondence without
relying on UL beam sweeping;

\- If the DUT's beam correspondence capability
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present, then DUT
chooses the TX beam for PUSCH transmission which is based on beam
correspondence with relying on both DL measurements on downlink
reference signals and network-assisted uplink beam sweeping (NOTE 3).

6\) SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

7\) Measure the mean power P~meas~ (Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ) of the
modulated signal arriving at the power measurement equipment (such as a
spectrum analyser, power meter, or gNB emulator).

8\) Calculate EIRP (Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ) by adding the composite
loss of the entire transmission path for utilized signal path,
L~EIRP,θ~, and frequency to the measured power P~meas~(Pol~Meas~=θ,
Pol~Link~=θ).

9\) Measure the mean power P~meas~ (Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~=θ) of the
modulated signal arriving at the power measurement equipment.

10\) Calculate EIRP (Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~=θ) by adding the composite
losses of the entire transmission path for utilized signal path,
L~EIRP,φ~, and frequency to the measured power P~meas~ (Pol~Meas~=φ,
Pol~Link~=θ).

11\) Calculate total EIRP(Pol~Link~=θ) = EIRP(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ)
+ EIRP(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~=θ).

12\) SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

13\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=φ polarization to form the TX beam
towards the measurement antenna. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME
for the UE TX beam selection to complete.

14\) Repeat steps 4 through 12 and get the result of total
EIRP(Pol~Link~=φ) = EIRP(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=φ) + EIRP(Pol~Meas~=φ,
Pol~Link~=φ)

15\) Advance to the next grid point and repeat steps 3 through 14 until
measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ have been completed

16\) After the measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ have been
completed and

a\) if the re-positioning concept is applied to the TX test cases,
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] for the Alignment Option selected in
Step 1. For the TX beam peak search in the second hemisphere, perform
steps 3 through 15 for the range of zenith angles 90^o^\>θ≥0^o^.

b\) if the re-positioning concept is not applied to the TX test cases,
continue steps 3 through 15 for the range of zenith angles
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^

If the beam correspondence capability
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* is not present, the above
step 5) can be further clarified as following sub-steps:

5.1) DUT uses downlink reference signals to select proper RX beam and
uses autonomous beam correspondence to select the TX beam.

5.2) SS configures M=8 SRS resources to DUT, with the field
*spatialRelationInfo* omitted and the field *usage* set as
'beamManagement'. In case DUT supports less than 8 SRS resources, SS
configures the number of SRS resources according to the maximum number
of SRS resources indicated by UE capability signalling. Additionally,
for codebook based PUSCH transmission, SS configures a semi-persistent
SRS resource set with the field *usage* as \'codebook\'.

5.3) Based on the TX beam autonomously selected by DUT, DUT chooses TX
beams to transmit SRS-resources configured by SS.

5.4) Based on measurement of the received *beamManagement* SRS, SS
chooses the best SRS beam and, if needed, updates the spatial relation
information between the semi-persistent *codebook* SRS resources and the
SS selected *beamManagement* SRS resource in the activation MAC CE of
the semi-persistent SRS resource. The SS indicates in the SRS Resource
Indicator (SRI) field in the scheduling grant for PUSCH, if present, the
SRS resource within the semi-persistent SRS resource set whose spatial
relation is linked to the best detected SRS beam.

5.5) DUT transmits PUSCH corresponding to the SRS resource indicated by
the SRI.

The TX beam peak direction is where the maximum total component of
EIRP(Pol~Link~=θ) or EIRP(Pol~Link~=φ) is found. Whenever this TX beam
peak direction is used, if the UE does not support
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping,* the side conditions for
SSB-based and CSI-RS based L1-RSRP measurements are applied as per Table
6.6.1.3.3.1.1-1 and Table 6.6.1.3.3.1.1-2 respectively just before
setting TX beam peak direction.

K.1.2 RX beam peak direction search
-----------------------------------

Editor's note: The following aspects are either missing or not yet
determined:

-   The Rx beam peak direction search for intra-band DL CA
    configurations with frequency separations larger than 800 MHz is
    currently FFS.

The RX beam peak direction is found with a 3D EIS scan (separately for
each orthogonal downlink polarization). The RX beam peak direction
search grid points for this single grid approach are defined in Annex
M.2.1. Alternatively, a coarse and fine grid approach could be used
according to the definition in Annex M.2.4.

The beam peak searches shall be performed for every test frequency range
by default unless the device manufacturer explicitly declares that the
beam peak at the mid test frequency range is applicable for the
remaining (low, high) test frequency ranges. Beam peak search results
cannot be re-used across different bands that do not overlap. Beam peak
search results can be re-used from bands that completely contain the
target bands if explicitly declared with a declaration.

A beam peak search shall be performed for every intra-band contiguous
combination and CA BW class by default unless the device manufacturer
explicitly declares that the beam peak for a reference (frequency band,
CBW) or (frequency band combination, CA BW class) is applicable for a
group of other intra-band contiguous combinations and CA BW classes.

The beam peak searches shall be performed for every modulation by
default unless the device manufacturer explicitly declares that the beam
peak at the QPSK modulation is applicable for the remaining 16QAM and
64QAM modulations.

The beam peak searches shall be performed separately for NTC (Normal),
ETC (TL), and ETC (TH).

The single carrier measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) Position the DUT in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables N.2-1 through
N.2-7 \[3\].

3\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=θ polarization to form the RX beam
towards the DUT. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME for the UE RX
beam selection to complete.

4\) Determine EIS(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ) for θ-polarization, i.e., by
sweeping the power level for the θ-polarization, at which the throughput
exceeds the requirements for the specified reference measurement
channel. The downlink power step size shall be no more than 0.2 dB when
the RF power level is near the sensitivity level (coarse and fine
searches are not precluded as long as the fine search is using the 0.2dB
step size near the sensitivity level).

5\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=φ polarization to form the RX beam
towards the DUT. Allow at least BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME for the UE RX
beam selection to complete.

6\) Determine EIS(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~=φ) for φ-polarization, i.e., by
sweeping the power level for the φ-polarization, at which the throughput
exceeds the requirements for the specified reference measurement
channel. The downlink power step size shall be no more than 0.2 dB when
the RF power level is near the sensitivity level (coarse and fine
searches are not precluded as long as the fine search is using the 0.2dB
step size near the sensitivity level).

7\) Advance to the next grid point and repeat steps 3 through 6 until
measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ have been completed

8\) After the measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ have been
completed and

a\) if the re-positioning concept is applied to the RX test cases,
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] for the Alignment Option selected in
Step 1. For the RX beam peak search in the second hemisphere, perform
steps 3 through 6 for the range of zenith angles 90^o^\>θ≥0^o^.

b\) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the RX test cases,
continue steps 3 through 6 for the range of zenith angles
90^o^\<θ≤180^o^

9\) Calculate the resulting "averaged EIS" as:

> averaged EIS = 2\*\[1/EIS(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ)
> +1/EIS(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~=φ)\]^-1^

The RX beam peak direction is where the minimum "averaged EIS" is found.

Alternatively, the RX beam peak direction for single carrier could be
determined following the procedure described in Annex K.1.11.

For intra-band DL CA configurations with a frequency separation up to
800 MHz, if for single carrier test the Rx beam peak direction has been
found for any frequency within the CA bandwidth, such direction shall be
used. Otherwise, the single carrier measurement procedure is performed
only on the PCC and the RX beam peak direction for the DL CA
configuration is the direction of the PCC Rx beam peak direction.

For intra-band DL CA configurations with a frequency separation up to
800 MHz, if UE vendor provides a Beam Peak Search Declaration with
respect to test frequency range for single CC for a given band, see
38.508-2 \[4\] table A.4.3.9-5, such declaration will also apply to PCC
in DL CA configurations for that band.

For intra-band DL CA configurations with a frequency separation larger
than 800 MHz the beam peak direction search procedure is FFS.

N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the TX test cases,

6\) Calculate EIRP(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~) by adding the composite loss
of the entire transmission path for utilized signal path, L~EIRP,θ~, and

EIRP(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~)

10\) SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the RX test cases,
position the device in DUT Orientation 1. If the re-positioning concept
is applied to the RX test cases

K.1.5 EIRP spherical coverage
-----------------------------

The EIRP results from the TX beam peak search procedures of K.1.1, using
the minimum number of grid points as described in Annex M.2.1 can be
re-used for EIRP spherical coverage.

In case a **coarse beam peak grid is used for TX beam peak search, using
the minimum number of grid points defined in Annex M.3.1.1, the EIRP
results can be re-used for EIRP spherical coverage.**

### K.1.5.0 Tx Spherical Coverage Method

In case a separate test is performed for EIRP spherical coverage, the
procedure as per K.1.1 should be followed using the minimum number of
grid points defined in Annex M.3.1.1 for spherical coverage.

The EIRP~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) computed using maximum(EIRP(Pol~Link~=θ),
EIRP(Pol~Link~=φ)) for all grid points. When using constant step size
measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction shall be applied, i.e.,
the PDF probability contribution for each measurement point is scaled by
sin(θ) or the normalized Clenshaw-Curtis weights W(θ)/W(90^o^),
introduced in Section M.4.2.1, to account for the denser grid point
distribution near the poles. In case of Clenshaw-Curtis weights, when
just a single measurement at the poles is performed, the PDF probability
contributions need to be scaled by M\*W(θ)/W(θ=90°) to account for the M
longitudes at those two grid points. When using constant density grids,
these corrections are not needed.

### K.1.5.1 Tx Fast Spherical Coverage Method

#### K.1.5.1.1 Introduction

The Fast Spherical Coverage Method is a test method providing an
optimized test time for Tx spherical coverage measurements. This method
is applicable to constant density and constant step size grid type.
Instead of measuring all grid points as per Annex M, as required by the
test procedure defined in Annex K.1.5, this method requires only a
reduced number of grid points to be measured.

#### K.1.5.1.2 Description

To use this method, apply the following steps

1\) During the EIRP Spherical coverage measurements, calculate the EIRP
result for the grid point as EIRP~spherical~ = Max(EIRP(Pol~Link~= θ),
EIRP(Pol~Link~= ϕ)) starting with N~grid,\ meas,\ PASS~ =0. If the
EIRP~spherical~ value is above the Min EIRP spherical coverage limit
increase N~grid,\ meas,\ PASS~ by 1.

2\) Calculate the percentage of total grid points measured thus far
above the EIRP spherical coverage requirement limit
N~grid,\ meas,\ PASS~ compared to the total number of grid points on the
measurement grid N~grid,total~.

3\) If the percentage calculated in step 2) is equal to or higher than
(100 - n^th^ percentile for EIRP spherical coverage)%, pass the device,
otherwise continue to step 4. If all grid points have been measured,
calculate the CDF for all grid points and pass the UE if the derived
%-tile EIRP in measurement distribution exceeds the requirement.
Otherwise fail the UE.

4\) Advance to the next grid point and repeat the steps until
measurements within zenith range 0º≤ θ ≤\[90\]º have been completed

NOTE 1: For test systems where the device repositioning approach
outlined in Annex N is applied, the grid points of up to a zenith of
\[90\]° are allowed to be measured in the first hemisphere before the
device needs to be placed in the second orientation.

K.1.5.1.3 Measurement uncertainties

Same as when test procedure described in clause K.1.5.0 is used.

K.1.6 EIS spherical coverage
----------------------------

The EIS results from the RX beam peak search procedures of K.1.2, using
the minimum number of grid points as described in Annex M.2.2 can be
re-used for EIS spherical coverage.

In case a **coarse beam peak grid is used for RX beam peak search with
an EIS metric, using the minimum number of grid points defined in Annex
M.3.2.1, the EIS results can be re-used for EIS spherical coverage.**

### K.1.6.0 Rx Spherical Coverage Method

In case a separate test is performed for spherical coverage, the
procedure K.1.2 should be followed using the minimum number of grid
points defined in Annex M.3.2.1 for spherical coverage.

The EIS~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) computed using averaged EIS for all grid points. When
using constant step size measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction
shall be applied, i.e., the PDF probability contribution for each
measurement point is scaled by sin(θ) or the normalized Clenshaw-Curtis
weights W(θ)/W(90^o^), introduced in Section M.4.2.1, to account for the
denser grid point distribution near the poles. In case of
Clenshaw-Curtis weights, when just a single measurement at the poles is
performed, the PDF probability contributions need to be scaled by
M\*W(θ)/W(θ=90°) to account for the M longitudes at those two grid
points. When using constant density grids, these corrections are not
needed.

### K.1.6.1 Rx Fast Spherical Coverage Method

#### K.1.6.1.1 Introduction

Same as Annex K.1.5.1.2 except that this sub-clause is applicable to Rx
measurements in Annex K.1.6.

#### K.1.6.1.2 Description

To use this method, apply the following steps

1\) During the EIS Spherical coverage measurements, calculate the
averaged EIS as: EIS = 2\*\[1/EIS(Pol~Meas~= θ Pol~Link~= θ)
+1/EIS(Pol~Meas~= ϕ Pol~Link~= ϕ)\]^-1^ at each grid point starting with
N~grid,\ meas,\ PASS~ =0. If the EIS value is below the EIS spherical
coverage limit increase N~grid,\ meas,\ PASS~ by 1.

2\) Calculate the percentage of total grid points measured thus far
above the EIS spherical coverage requirement limit N~grid,\ meas,\ PASS~
compared to the total number of grid points on the measurement grid
N~grid,total~.

3\) If the percentage calculated in step 2) is equal to or higher than
(100 - n^th^ percentile for EIS spherical coverage)%, pass the device,
otherwise continue to step 4. If all grid points have been measured,
calculate the CCDF for all grid points and pass the UE if the derived
%-tile EIS in measurement distribution exceeds the requirement.
Otherwise fail the UE.

4\) Advance to the next grid point and repeat the steps until
measurements within zenith range 0º≤ θ ≤\[90\]º have been completed.

NOTE 1: Same as NOTE 1 in Annex K.1.5.1.2.

K.1.6.1.3 Measurement uncertainties

Same as when test procedure described in clause K.1.6.0 is used.

K.1.7 TRP measurement procedure
-------------------------------

outlined in Annex M.4.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the TX test cases,
position the device in DUT Orientation 1. If the re-positioning concept
is applied to the TX test cases

a\) position the device in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables N.2-1 through
N.2-7 \[3\] if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular
range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1

b\) Position de device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] if the maximum beam peak direction is
within zenith angular range 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for
the alignment option selected in step 1.

3\) Connect the SS with the DUT through the measurement antenna with
desired polarization reference Pol~Link~ to form the TX beam towards the
desired TX beam direction and respective polarization. Allow at least
BEAM\_SELECT\_WAIT\_TIME for the UE TX beam selection to complete.

4\) SS activates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.2 using
condition Tx only.

5\) For each measurement grid point, measure P~meas~(Pol~Meas~=θ,
Pol~Link~) and P~meas~(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~). The angle between the
measurement antenna and the DUT (θ~Meas~, φ~Meas~) is achieved by
rotating the measurement antenna and the DUT (based on system
architecture).

6\) Calculate EIRP(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~) and EIRP(Pol~Meas~=φ,
Pol~Link~) by adding the composite loss of the entire transmission path
for utilized signal paths, L~EIRP,θ~, L~EIRP,φ~ and frequency to the
respective measured powers P~meas~.

7\) The TRP value for the uniform measurement grid is calculated using
the TRP integration approaches outlined in Annex M.4.2. The TRP value
for the constant density grid is calculated using the TRP integration
formula in Annex M.4.3.

8\) SS deactivates the UE Beamlock Function (UBF) by performing the
procedure as specified in TS 38.508-1 \[10\] clause 4.9.3.

K.1.8 Blocking measurement procedure
------------------------------------

The RX beam peak direction is where the minimum EIS is found according
to K.1.2.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-7 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) If the re-positioning concept is not applied to the RX test cases,
position the device in DUT Orientation 1. If the re-positioning concept
is applied to the RX test cases

a\) position the device in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables N.2-1 through
N.2-7 \[3\] if the maximum beam peak direction is within zenith angular
range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ for the alignment option selected in step 1

b\) position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2)
from Tables N.2-1 through N.2-7 \[3\] if the maximum beam peak direction
is within zenith angular range 90^o^\<θ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for
the alignment option selected in step 1.

3\) Establish a connection between the DUT and the SS with the downlink
signal applied to the θ-polarization of the measurement antenna

4\) Position the UE so that the beam is formed towards the measurement
antenna in the RX beam peak direction.

5\) Apply a signal with the specified reference measurement channel on
the θ-polarization, setting the power level of the signal 3dB below the
level stated in the requirement.

6\) Apply the blocking signal with the same polarization and coming from
the same direction as the downlink signal. Set the power level of the
blocking signal 3dB below the level stated in the requirement.

7\) Measure the throughput of the downlink signal on the θ-polarization.

8\) Switch the downlink and blocking signal to the φ-polarization of the
measurement antenna.

9\) Repeat steps 3 to 7 on the φ-polarization.

10\) Compare the results for both the θ-polarization and φ-polarization
against the requirement. If both results meet the requirements, pass the
UE.

K.1.9 Beam Correspondence tolerance procedure
---------------------------------------------

This beam correspondence tolerance procedure applies to the DUT with
beam correspondence capability
*beamCorrespondenceWithoutUL-BeamSweeping* not present (which shall
match OEM declaration), such that DUT relies on uplink beam sweeping to
fulfil the minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps for each of the
points in the grid:

1\) Follow the test procedures specified in subclause K.1.5 with uplink
beam sweeping disabled, obtain total EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=θ) and total
EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=φ). EIRP~1~ is calculated by EIRP~1~ =
maximum(EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=θ), EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=φ)).

2\) Follow the test procedures specified in subclause K.1.5, with uplink
beam sweeping enabled (SS does not configure the *spatialRelationInfo*
to DUT) during DUT TX beam refinement, obtain total EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=θ)
and total EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=φ). EIRP~2~ is calculated by EIRP~2~ =
maximum(EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=θ), EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=φ)).

3\) Calculate the ΔEIRP~BC~ = EIRP~2~ -- EIRP~1~.

The ΔEIRP~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) computed using ΔEIRP~BC~ for each of all top N^th^
percentile of the EIRP~2~ measurement points in the grid. When using
constant step size measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction shall
be applied, i.e., the PDF probability contribution for each measurement
point is scaled by sin(θ) or the normalized Clenshaw-Curtis weights
W(θ)/W(90^o^), introduced in Section M.4.2.1.

NOTE: ΔEIRP~BC~ is introduced for beam correspondence tolerance based on
two EIRP measurements (EIRP~1~ and EIRP~2~). EIRP~1~ is the measured
total EIRP based on the beam which DUT chooses autonomously
(corresponding beam) to transmit in the direction of the incoming DL
signal, which is based on beam correspondence without relying on UL beam
sweeping. EIRP~2~ is the measured total EIRP based on the beam yielding
highest EIRP in a given direction, which is based on beam correspondence
with relying on UL beam sweeping. ΔEIRP~BC~ shall be calculated over the
link angles spanning a subset of the spherical coverage grid points
which are corresponding to the top N^th^ percentile of the EIRP~2~
measurement points in the grid, where the value of N is according to
EIRP spherical coverage requirement of DUT's power class defined in TS
38.101-2 \[3\] clause 6.2.1, e.g., N=50 for power class 3 DUT.

K.1.11 RSRP(B) based RX beam peak search
----------------------------------------

Editor's Note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are not
determined.

-   Feasibility and Applicability of this RSRP-B based Rx beam peak
    search is FFS

-   Additional analysis of side conditions to be applied is FFS

    Carrier Aggregation and EN-DC is still FFS

RSRP(B)-based RX beam peak search approach is applicable to find the
beam peak, the beam peak search time can be reduced significantly.

### K.1.11.1 Test procedure

The RX beam peak direction is found with a 3D RSRP(B) scan (separately
for each orthogonal downlink polarization). The RX beam peak direction
is where the maximum total component of RSRP is found. The RX beam peak
direction search grid points for this single grid approach are defined
in Annex M,2.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
N.2-1 through N.2-3 \[3\] to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) Position the DUT in DUT Orientation 1 or 2 from Tables N.2-1 through
N.2-3 \[3\].

3\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=θ polarization to form the RX beam
towards the measurement antenna.

4\) Adjust the DL power of the SS to obtain the NR DL signal level as
per Table C.0-1 at the centre of QZ. Determine RSRP or RSRPBs (one per
receiver branch) at Pol~Meas~=Pol~Link~=θ condition reported by UE.

5\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=φ polarization to form the RX beam
towards the measurement antenna.

6\) Set the same DL power as the one in step 4. Determine RSRP or RSRPBs
(one per receiver branch) at Pol~Meas~=Pol~Link~=φ condition reported by
UE.

7\) Advance to the next grid point and repeat steps 3 through 6 until
measurements within the full 3D scan have been completed.

8\) Data processing the linear sum of four reported RSRPBs. How to
calculate the reported RSRPs is FFS.

To guarantee RSRP(B) accuracy, SNR side condition configuration can
refer to the minimum SSB\_RP specified for beam correspondence defined
in Table K.1.11-1 (from TS 38.101-2 \[3\] Table 6.6.4.3.1-1):

K.1.12 Enhanced test method for EIRP measurements 
-------------------------------------------------

Editor's Note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are not
determined.

-   Applicability of this enhanced method is FFS

-   Additional analysis of how this method can be used within existing
    tests is FFS

-   Additional optimization of the method for use in scenarios such as
    Carrier Aggregation and EN-DC is still FFS

Transmitted Matrix Precoding Indicator (TPMI) is the basis of codebook
based transmission enabling multi-port antenna transmission. TPMI method
is identified as applicable method to enhance EIRP measurement, which is
able to activate dual polarization transmission in EIRP measurement. The
applicability of this method is defined in Clause K.1.12.1.

For FR2 UEs support the TPMI method, the precoding matrix $W$ is given
by Table K.1.12-1 (same as Table 6.3.1.5-1 in TS 38.211 \[9\]). 2Tx TPMI
index 2-5 can force UE single-layer transmission using two antenna
ports. Among them, only TPMI index 2 is selected for EIRP measurement.

transmission using two antenna ports

The permitted test methods (i.e. DFF, IFF and NFTF) in \[5\] are all
applicable for TPMI method with the additional procedure that the UE
should be configured with TPMI index and working at single-layer
transmission using two antenna ports, before performing EIRP-based test
procedures in Clause 5.2.1.3 in TR38.810 \[5\].:

\- Peak EIRP Measurement Procedure

\- TRP Measurement Procedure

\- TX Beam Peak direction search and EIRP Spherical Coverage

#### K.1.12.1 Applicability of TPMI side condition method

TPMI is applicable for one layer transmission with multi-port antenna.
In FR2, dual polarization can be regarded as dual antenna ports, so it
is natural to activate dual polarization transmission with TPMI side
condition in EIRP measurement procedure. However, for TPMI supporting
dual antenna ports, the number of SRS ports (*nrofSRS-Ports*) is
configured as 2 for both one layer transmission with 'full power
transmission' and two layers transmission with regular UL MIMO, as
specified in clause 6.1 of TS 38.101-2 \[3\]:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| For a UE that supports \'UL full power transmission\' and is         |
| configured to transmit a single layer with *nrofSRS-Ports* = 2, the  |
| requirements for UL MIMO operation apply only when it is configured  |
| for any of its declared full power modes in IE                       |
| *FullPowerTransmission-r16* (as defined in TS 38.331\[19\]).         |
|                                                                      |
| For a UE configured to transmit 2 layers, transmitter requirements   |
| for UL MIMO operation apply when the UE transmits on 2 ports on the  |
| same CDM group. The UE may use higher MPR values outside this        |
| limitation.                                                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Thus, TPMI method is applicable for the following FR2 UEs:

\- Rel-15 Coherent UE (UE capability *pusch-TransCoherence* =
*fullCoherent* with network configuration *codebookSubset=
FullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent*).

\- Rel-16 and onwards Coherent UE (UE capability *pusch-TransCoherence*
= *fullCoherent* with network configuration *codebookSubset=
FullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent*).

\- Rel-16 and onwards UE supporting UL full power transmission mode1 (UE
capability *ul-FullPwrMode1-r16= supported* with network configuration
*ul-FullPowerTransmission* = *fullpowerMode1*).

Other UEs are not applicable for TPMI based test method.

########  Annex L (normative): Void

######## Annex M:(normative) Measurement grids

This appendix describes the assumptions and definition of the minimum
number of measurement grid points for various grid types. Further
details can be found in \[5\].

A total of three measurement grids are considered:

\- Beam Peak Search Grid: using this grid, the TX and RX beam peak
direction will be determined. 3D EIRP scans are used to determine the TX
beam peak direction and 3D Throughput/RSRP/EIS scans for RX beam peak
directions.

\- Spherical Coverage Grid: using this grid, the CDF of the EIRP/EIS
distribution in 3D is calculated to determine the spherical coverage
performance.

\- TRP Measurement Grid: using this grid, the total power radiated by
the DUT in the TX beam peak direction is determined by integrating the
EIRP measurements taken on the sampling grid.

M.1 Grid Types
==============

Two different measurement grid types are considered:

\- The constant step size grid type has the azimuth and elevation angles
uniformly distributed as in the examples illustrated in Figures M.1-1 in
2D and M.1-2 in 3D.

In order to make a reasonable trade-off with measurement uncertainties,
it is recommended to use for beam peak search the following measurement
grids leading to a systematic error of "Beam Peak Search" of 0.7 dB:

\- Constant density grid (using the charged particle implementation)
with at least 3000 grid points.

\- Constant step size grid with at least 4902 grid points, corresponding
to an angular step size of 3.6º.

For better measurement uncertainties, finer measurement grids as shown
in Table M.2.1.1-1 may be used. Choice of grids among these 2 types of
grids is up to test system implementation.

M.2.2 Coarse and fine measurement grids
---------------------------------------

The baseline beam peak search is based on a single and fine beam peak
search grid to determine the TX/RX beam peak of the DUT in any given
direction. This means that even in sectors where poor EIRP/EIS
performance is observed, a very fine grid is used to search for the
TX/RX beam peak.

An optimized approach, based on an initial coarse search followed by a
subsequent fine search could reduce the number of beam peak search grid
points significantly. The basis for this approach is to use a coarse
grid with fewer number of points than the ones described in section
M.2.1 in the first stage to identify candidate regions that contain the
global beam peak and search for the global beam peak with the fine grid
in the second stage with a minimum number of points described in section
M.2.1.

As an example, Figure M.2.2-1 illustrates the coarse and fine
measurement grid approach applied to TX beam search; while this
illustration is for EIRP, it can easily be extended to RX beam peak
search using EIS.For simplification purposes, 2D coarse and fine
searches are illustrated but the concept can be extended to 3D easily.
The UE is assumed to form a total of six beams in the 2D plane as
illustrated on the left of Figure M.2.2-1. In the centre of Figure
M.2.2-1, the 36 coarse beam peak search grid points in the 2D plane are
illustrated. On the right, the grey dots on the respective antenna
patterns illustrate the measured EIRP values towards each coarse grid
point direction based on the respective beam steering directions. This
illustration shows that the EIRP beam peak of the coarse search,
EIRP~CSBP~, is found to be the peak of the orange beam while the global
TX beam peak (red beam) was not identified due to the coarse sampling of
the grid points.

Peak Search. Left: Antenna Pattern assumptions in 2D, Centre: Coarse
beam peak search grid points/discrete antenna measurement positions,
Right: TX beam EIRP measurements per grid point

The proposed fine search approach is illustrated further in Figure
M.2.2-2. A fine search region starting from the beam peak identified in
the coarse search, EIRP~CSBP~, over a range of ∆~FS~ is used to identify
the regions that need to be investigated more closely with the fine
search algorithm. The fine search range ∆~FS~ is a function of the
angular spacing of the coarse beam peak search grid as well as the beam
width of the reference antenna pattern considered for smartphone UEs.

In order to maintain the same MU as the fine beam peak search
measurement grids in Clause M.2.1.3, i.e., 0.5 dB for PC3 UEs, the
minimum ∆~FS~ from Table M.2.2-1 for constant step-size grids and from
Table M.2.2-2 for constant density grids shall be applied to the
coarse&fine search for PC3 UEs. The results presented in these tables
utilize coarse measurement grids that match the spherical coverage grids
from Clause M.3.

When the coarse&fine searches with constant-step size grids are
utilizing step sizes of ∆~coarse~=∆θ~coarse~=∆φ~coarse~ with
∆~coarse~=2∆~fine~, 8 fine grid points are selected for each coarse grid
point within ∆~FS~ as outlined highlighted in Figure M.2.2-3.

For the 6x2 and 4x2 configurations utilizing the spherical coverage grid
with constant step size grids, outlined in Clause M.3, as coarse
measurement grid, the coarse and fine grid step sizes are no longer an
integer multiple of each other. The above approach to select the 8
closest neighbours of the coarse grid point, Figure M.2.2-3, is no
longer applicable. Instead, a different approach shall be applied to
those constant-step size grids as well as all constant-density grids.
Here, the fine grid points surrounding a coarse grid point identified to
be within ∆~FS~ shall be contained within a conical region around that
coarse grid point. This approach is further visualized in Figure M.2.2-4
for the constant step size grids and in Figure M.2.2-5 for the constant
density grids. The half-angle of the cone shall match the values in
Table M.2.2-1 and Table M.2.2-2, respectively, which correspond to
1.5∆~fine~ for the constant step size grids and 1.5\*maximum separation
between a fine grid point and its 6 closest neighbours.

In these figures, red grid points correspond to fine grid points and the
blue points correspond to the coarse grid points. The conical region
around a sample coarse grid point is visualized in yellow, while the
fine grid points within those regions are highlighted in green.

M.3.1 EIRP spherical coverage
-----------------------------

### M.3.1.1 UE Power classes

#### M.3.1.1.1 Power class 1 devices

The same antenna array assumptions as in Clause M.2.1.1 apply.
Additionally, the following assumptions apply:

\- two antenna arrays integrated inside DUT, one in the front and one in
the back

\- the implementation loss for the antenna near the front is 5dB less
than that for the antenna near the back

\- beam steering assumptions as follows:

\- In the xz plane, 45° beam steering granularity (from 45° to 135°)

\- In the xy plane, 25° beam steering granularity (from -90° to 90°)

In order to make a reasonable trade-off with measurement uncertainties,
it is recommended to use the following recommendation in terms of min.
number of grid points, standard deviation, and mean error for spherical
coverage grids:

\- constant density grid (using the charged particle implementation)
with at least 200 grid points: standard deviation (MU element 'Influence
of spherical coverage grid') of 0.13dB and 0.04dB Mean Error

\- constant step size grid with at least 266 grid points: standard
deviation (MU element 'Influence of spherical coverage grid') of 0.12dB
and 0.06dB Mean Error

For better measurement uncertainties, finer measurement grids as shown
in Tables M.3.1.1.1-1 and M.3.1.1.1-2 may be used. Choice of grids among
these 2 types of grids is up to test system implementation.

There is no need to have the Tx beam peak placed on a measurement grid
point.

For constant step size measurement grids, the CDF analyses require the
PDFs to be scaled by sin(theta) or the normalized Clenshaw-Curtis
weights W(θ)/W(90^o^), introduced in Section M.4.2.1.

it is recommended to use the following recommendation in terms of min.
number of grid points, standard deviation, and mean error for spherical
coverage grids:

\- constant density grid (using the charged particle implementation)
with at least 200 grid points: standard deviation (MU element 'Influence
of spherical coverage grid') of 0.13dB and 0.04dB Mean Error

\- constant step size grid with at least 266 grid points: standard
deviation (MU element 'Influence of spherical coverage grid') of 0.12dB
and 0.06dB Mean Error

\- the MU element 'Systematic error related to EIS spherical coverage'
is the DL step size, i.e., 0.2dB.

Choice of grids among these 2 types of grids is up to test system
implementation.

There is no need to have the Rx beam peak placed on a measurement grid
point.

For constant step size measurement grids, the CCDF analyses require the
PDFs to be scaled by sin(theta) or the normalized Clenshaw-Curtis
weights W(θ)/W(90^o^), introduced in Section M.4.2.1.

M.4.2 TRP Integration for Constant Step Size Grid Type
------------------------------------------------------

Different approaches to perform the TRP integration from the respective
EIRP measurements are outlined in the next sub clauses for the constant
step size grid type.

### M.4.2.1 TRP Integration using Weights

In many engineering disciplines, the integral of a function needs to be
solved using numerical integration techniques, commonly referred to as
"quadrature". Here, the approximation of the integral of a function is
usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at specified points
within the domain of integration. The derivation from the closed surface
TRP integral

![](./media/image120.emf){width="2.8020833333333335in"
height="0.47708333333333336in"}

to the classical discretized summation equation used for OTA

![](./media/image121.emf){width="5.406944444444444in"
height="0.6159722222222223in"}

The weights for this integral are based on the sinθ⋅∆θ weights. More
accurate implementations are based on the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature
integral approximation based on an expansion of the integrand in terms
of Chebyshev polynomials. This implementation does not ignore the
measurement points at the poles (θ=0^o^ and 180^o^) where sinθ = 0. The
discretized TRP can be expressed as

![](./media/image122.emf){width="4.151388888888889in"
height="0.6159722222222223in"}

which the sinθ⋅∆θ weights replaced by a weight function W(θ) and extends
the sum over I to include the poles.  There is no simple closed-form
expression for the Clenshaw-Curtis weights; however, a numerical
straightforward approach is available, i.e.,

![](./media/image123.emf){width="6.522916666666666in"
height="0.8486111111111111in"}

with

$$b_{j} = \left\{ \text{\ \ \ \ }\begin{matrix}
1,\ \ 2j = \text{N\ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \\
2,\ \ \text{otherwise} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $$

and

$$c_{i} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\ \ \ \ 1,\ \ i = 0\ or\ N \\
2,\ \ \text{otherwise} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $$

The Clenshaw-Curtis weights are compared to the classical sin θ⋅∆θ
weights in Tables M.4.2.1-1 and M.4.2.1-2 for two different numbers of
latitudes. The TRP measurement grid consists of N+1 latitudes and M
longitudes with

$$\theta_{i} = i\mathrm{\Delta}\theta\ \text{where}\ \mathrm{\Delta}\theta = \frac{\pi}{N}$$

and

$$\phi_{j} = j\mathrm{\Delta}\phi\ \text{where}\ \mathrm{\Delta}\phi = \frac{2\pi}{M}$$

M.4.3 TRP Integration for Constant Density Grid Types
-----------------------------------------------------

For constant density grid types, the TRP integration should ideally take
into account the area of the Voronoi region surrounding each grid point.
Assuming an ideal constant density configuration of the grid points, the
TRP can be approximated using

![](./media/image124.emf){width="4.895138888888889in"
height="0.5583333333333333in"}

where N is the number of grid points of the constant density grid type.

M.4.4 Interpolation at or near the Pole
---------------------------------------

As illustrated in Figure M.4.4-1, for systems that either do not allow
measurements at the pole (θ=180^o^), e.g., using distributed-axes
positioners, or systems that have the positioners/support structures
block the radiation towards the pole (θ=180^o^), e.g., combined-axes
positioners, measurements beyond 150^o^ in θ can be skipped and
interpolated instead for measurement grids defined in Annex M.4.1.

Table M.4.5-3a: Void

For spurious emissions, TRP measurements with measurement antennas
displaced up to 10^o^ from the focal point (based on electrical
switching) in an IFF (based on CATR) test system, alternate TRP
approaches for constant-step size grids are allowed for the coarse and
fine grids:

\- interpolation to the non-offset system coordinate system that allows
the use of Clenshaw-Curtis or classical sin(θ) quadratures

\- use of the advanced Jacobian matrix quadrature approach that uses
triangulations of the sphere

######## Annex N (normative): UE coordinate system

N.1 Reference coordinate system
===============================

This annex defines the measurement coordinate system for the NR UE. The
reference coordinate system as defined in IEEE Std 149 \[27\] is
provided in Figure N.1-1 below while Figure N.1.-2 shows an example DUT
in the default alignment, i.e., the DUT and the reference coordinate
systems are aligned with α = 0^o^ and β = 0^o^ and γ = 0^o^ where α, β,
and γ describe the relative angles between the two coordinate systems.

Figure N.1-2: DUT default alignment of example smartphone UE to
coordinate system

The following aspects are necessary:

\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed
in order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the
test, e.g., in the drawings used in this annex, the three buttons are on
the bottom of the device (front) and the camera is on the top of the
device (back).

\- An understanding of the origin and alignment the coordinate system
inside the test system i.e. the directions in which the x, y, z -axes
points inside the test chamber is needed in order to define unambiguous
DUT orientation, DUT beam, signal, interference, and measurement angles

N.2 Test conditions and angle definitions
=========================================

Tables N.2-1 through N.2-3 below provides the test conditions and angle
definitions for three permitted device alignment for smartphones and
tablets for the default test condition, DUT orientation 1, and two
different options for each permitted device alignment to re-position the
device for DUT Orientation 2 by figures in Tables N.2-1 through N.2-3.

Table N.2-4 below provides the test conditions and angle definitions for
the permitted device alignment for laptops for the default test
condition, DUT orientation 1, and two different options for each
permitted device alignment to re-position the device for DUT Orientation
2 as outlined in Figures N.3-1 and N.3-2. The display is open at a lid
angle of 110º ± 5º, where lid angle is defined as the angle between the
front of the display to the levelled base, and the full projected volume
is centred inside the test volume.

Tables N.2-5 through N.2-7 below provides the test conditions and angle
definitions for the three permitted device alignment options for Fixed
Wireless Access (FWA) for the default test condition, DUT orientation 1,
and two different options for each permitted device alignment to
re-position the device for DUT Orientation 2 as outlined in Figures
N.3-1 and N.3-2. Due to changes in DUT orientations α, β, and γ for the
alignment options for FWA proposed in Tables N.2-6 through N.2-7 when
compared to those in Tables N.2-2 through N.2-3, new alignment options,
i.e., Options 4 and 5, were introduced.

+------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+

For each UE requirement and test case, each of the parameters in Table
J.2-1 through J.2-10 need to be recorded, such that DUT positioning, DUT
beam direction, and angles of the signal, link/interferer, and
measurement are specified in terms of the fixed coordinate system.

Due to the non-commutative nature of rotations, the order of rotations
is important and needs to be defined when multiple DUT orientations are
tested.

The rotations around the x, y, and z axes can be defined with the
following rotation matrices

![](./media/image152.wmf){width="2.1979166666666665in" height="1.0in"}

![](./media/image153.wmf){width="2.2444444444444445in" height="1.0in"}

and

![](./media/image154.wmf){width="2.1277777777777778in" height="1.0in"}.

with the respective angles of rotation, *α*, *β*, *γ,* and

![](./media/image155.wmf){width="0.9069444444444444in" height="1.0in"}

Additionally, any translation of the DUT can be defined with the
translation matrix

![](./media/image156.wmf){width="1.8840277777777779in" height="1.0in"}

with offsets t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively and with

![](./media/image157.wmf){width="0.8840277777777777in" height="1.0in"}

The combination of rotations and translation is captured by the
multiplication of rotation and translation matrices.

For instance, the matrix M

$$\ M = T\left( t_{x},t_{y},t_{z} \right) \cdot R_{z}\left( \gamma \right) \cdot R_{y}\left( \beta \right) \cdot R_{x}\left( \alpha \right)$$

describes an initial rotation of the DUT around the x axis with angle
* α*, a subsequent rotation around the y axis with angle *β*, and a
final rotation around the z axis with angle *γ*. After those rotations,
the DUT is translated by t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively.

N.3 DUT positioning guidelines
==============================

Near-field coupling effects between the antenna and the
pedestals/positioners/fixtures generally cause increased signal ripples.
Re-positioning the DUT by directing the beam peak away from those areas
can reduce the effect of signal ripple on EIRP/EIS measurements. Figure
N.3-1 and N.3-2 illustrate how to reposition the DUT in distributed axes
and combined axes system, when the beam peak is directed to the DUTs
upper hemisphere (DUT orientation 1) or the DUTs lower hemisphere (DUT
orientation 2). While these figures are examples of different
positioning systems and other implementations are not precluded, the
relative orientation of the coordinate system with respect to the
antennas/reflectors and the axes of rotation shall apply to any
measurement setup.

system

![](./media/image159.emf){width="6.686111111111111in"
height="2.58125in"}

Figure N.3-2: DUT re-positioning for an example of combined-axes system

For EIRP/EIS measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure the
pedestal is not obstructing the beam path and that the pedestal is not
in closer proximity to the measurement antenna/reflector than the DUT.
For TRP measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure that the beam
peak direction is not obstructed by the pedestal and the pedestal is in
the measurement path only when measuring the back-hemisphere. No
re-positioning during the TRP measurement is required.

The radiating portions of the device have to be fully enclosed within
the quiet zone, but the non-radiating portions of the device can be
located/placed outside the quiet zone if a vendor declaration with
positioning reference points and the minimum QZ required to contain all
active antennas within the quiet zone (per band) is provided. This
grey-box testing approach where the declared reference point is aligned
with the centre of the QZ is further illustrated in Figure N.3-3.

Figure N.3-3: Grey-box test approach

In the absence of a vendor declaration, the geometric centre of the DUT
shall be aligned with the centre of the QZ and the DUT shall be fully
contained within the QZ. This black-box testing approach is further
illustrated in Figure N.3-4.

######## Annex O: Quality of the quiet zone validation

O.1 General
-----------

This annex describes the procedures for validating the quality of the
quiet zone for the permitted far-field methods outlined in Annex B.2.2
(DFF), B.2.3 (simplified DFF), and in B.2.4 (IFF based on CATR) in
\[10\]. Annex O.2 focuses on the procedure for in-band and OOB test
cases while Annex O.3 focuses on the procedure for spurious emissions
test cases. These procedures are applicable to PC1 and PC3 UEs.

The quality of quiet zone validation shall be repeated when the
RF/propagation conditions inside the chamber have changed, e.g., the
chamber has been disassembled and reassembled, portions of the absorber
been replaced, measurement antennas/probes been replaced, positioning
system been replaced, etc.

O.2 Procedure to characterize the quality of the quiet zone for in-band/OOB for the permitted far field methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure is mandatory before the test system is commissioned for
certification tests and characterizes the quiet zone performance of the
anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of reflections within the
anechoic chamber including any positioners and support structures.
Additionally, it includes the effect of offsetting the directive antenna
array inside a DUT from the centre of the quiet zone, i.e., the centre
of rotation of the DUT and measurement antenna positioning systems as
well as the directivity MU, i.e., the variation of antenna gains in the
different direct line-of-sight links.

The quiet zone is illustrated in Figure O.2-1 which includes the
definitions of centre of quiet zone range, i.e., the geometric centre of
the positioning systems, and the range length, i.e., the distance
between the centre of the quiet zone and the aperture of the measurement
antenna.

![](./media/image162.png){width="5.0in" height="2.2909722222222224in"}

Figure O.2-1: Quiet Zone Illustration

The outcome of the procedures can be used to predict the

\- variation of the TRP measurements, spherical surface integrals of
EIRP/EIS, when the DUT is placed anywhere within the quiet zone and with
the beam formed in any arbitrary direction inside the chamber

\- variation of the EIRP/EIS measurements when the DUT is placed
anywhere within the quiet zone and with the beam formed in any arbitrary
direction inside the chamber

The reference coordinate system defined in Annex N applies to this
procedure.

### O.2.1 Equipment used

The reference antenna under test (AUT) that is placed at various
locations within the quiet zone shall be a directive antenna with
similar properties of typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs. The
characteristics in terms of Directivity and Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW)
of the reference AUT are shown in Figure O.2.1-1, O.2.1-2, and O.2.1-3.

height="3.1743055555555557in"}

Figure O.2.1-3: 2xHPBW-H mask

AUT shall be symmetric on E and H planes.

The above masks for the reference antenna are met based on antenna
vendors' calibration report.

For the measurement, a combination of signal generator and spectrum
analyser or a network analyser can be used. The multi-port (with three
ports) network analyser is most suitable to reduce test time as both
polarizations of the measurement antenna can be measured simultaneously,
and multiple frequencies can be measured in a sweep.

### O.2.2 Test frequencies

The frequencies to be used to characterize the quality of the quiet zone
are 23.45 GHz, 32.125 GHz, 40.8 GHz, 44.3 GHz, and 49 GHz. The quiet
zone validation analysis is performed for each frequency individually.

### O.2.3 Reference measurements

The quality of the quiet measurements for integrated RF parameters such
as TRP shall use 3D pattern measurements of the reference antenna
patterns as they most closely resemble the 3D/spherical surface
measurements/integrals of EIRP or EIS. Therefore, the quality of the
quiet zone measurements for TRP metrics shall be based on efficiency
measurements. On the other hand, the quality of the quiet zone
measurements for single-directional EIRP and EIS metrics shall be based
on gain measurements of the direct line-of-sight link between the
reference AUT and the measurement antenna.

The grid types for the TRP measurements shall match those outlined in
M.1. Considering the reference AUT is assumed to have similar properties
of typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs, see Clause O.2.1, the TRP
measurement grids used for the QoQZ validation shall meet the minimum
number of grids points as defined for Power Class 3 devices in Clause
M.4.1.3 with the default TRP measurement grids, i.e., not those based on
the optional vendor declaration.

### O.2.4 Size of the quiet zone

The size of the quiet zone within which the variations of measurements
are evaluated depends on the size of the DUT. For smartphones, the quiet
zone shall be considered a sphere with radius of R=10cm. For larger
smartphones and tablet type devices, the quiet zone shall be considered
a sphere with radius of R=15cm. For even larger device, e.g., larger
tablets and laptops, quiet zones of radius *R*=20cm and *R*=27.5cm shall
be considered. Alternate quiet zone sizes can be defined for even larger
DUTs.

The quality of quiet zone procedure for systems supporting multiple
quiet zone sizes can be performed for the largest quiet zone radius only
and the results can be applied to the smaller quiet zone radii if the
same chamber components affecting QoQZ, i.e., reflector, feed probes,
etc, are used. Performing separate sets of quality of quiet zone
measurements for different radii is not precluded.

### O.2.5 Reference AUT positions

The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different
reference positions, shown in Figure O.2.5.1-1 and O.2.5.2-1

While position 1, P1, is the centre of the quiet zone, the remaining
positions, 2 through 7, are off-centre positions each displaced by the

### O.2.5.1 Distributed-axes system

### O.2.6 Reference AUT orientations

As different areas within the chamber could yield variations in the
field uniformity inside the quiet zone caused by reflections, it is
important to characterize the electromagnetic fields with the reference
antennas uniformly illuminating the anechoic chamber.

### O.2.6.1 Distributed-axes system

In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization
manageable in terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the
reference measurements for the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna
positions with the antenna rotated around the y axis with 5 different
angles *β*, i.e., *β* = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, and 180^o^, and
rotated around the z axis with 8 different *γ * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^,
135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical illustration of
the some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure O.2.6.1-1
with a reference AUT placed at position 6, P6, for reference antenna
polarization *γ*~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure O.2.6.1-2 illustrates the reference
AUT orientations for the reference polarization *γ*~pol~ = 90^o^.

The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as

for the distributed-axes system.

height="3.220833333333333in"}

Figure O.2.6.1-2: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 6, P6,
for reference antenna polarization γ~pol~ = 90^o^

When facing the z-axis, *β* = 0^o^ and *β* = 180^o^, the antenna does
not need to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the z
axis. A single orientation is sufficient since those orientations are
unique. Due to the pedestal, distributed-axes systems are not able to
measure towards the *β* =180^o^ direction; for those systems, the
reference measurements at this reference AUT orientation can be skipped.

If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex N is adopted for
the EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet zone
analysis is sufficient only for *β * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^~.~

The positioner relative coordinates/orientations with respect to the
measurement antenna/reflector in the initial position shall remain the
same for each reference antenna orientation, e.g., in the sample
distributed-axes system shown in Figure O.2.5.1-2 the reference antenna
shall be pointed towards the positioner for *β* = 135^o^ for the initial
position of (θ,φ) of (0,0).

### O.2.6.2 Combined-axes system

In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization
manageable in terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the
reference measurements for the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna
positions with the antenna rotated around the x axis with 5 different
angles α, i.e., α = -90^o^, -45^o^, 0^o^, 45^o^, and 90^o^ and rotated
around the y axis with 8 different angles *β* = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^,
135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical illustration of
some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure O.2.6.2-1 with
a reference AUT placed at position 4, P4, for reference antenna
polarization *γ*~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure O.2.6.2-2 illustrates the reference
AUT orientations for the reference polarization *γ*~pol~ = 90^o^.

The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as

for the combined-axes system.

Figure O.2.6.2-2: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 4, P4,
for reference antenna polarization γ~pol~ = 90^o^

When facing the y axis, *α* = 90^o^ and *α* = -90^o^, the antenna does
not need to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the y
axis. A single rotation is sufficient since those orientations are
unique. Due to the pedestal of the 2-axis positioner, combined-axes
systems are not able to measure towards the *β* = 180^o^ direction; for
those systems, the reference measurements at this reference AUT
orientation can be skipped.

If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex N is adopted for
all EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet zone
analysis is sufficient only for *β * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 270^o^, and
315^o^~.~

The positioner relative coordinates/orientations with respect to the
measurement antenna/reflector shall remain the same for each reference
antenna orientation, e.g., in the sample combined-axes system shown in
O.2.5.2-2 the reference antenna shall be pointed towards the positioner
for *β* = 135^o^ and 225^o^ for the initial position of (θ,φ) of (0,0).

O.2.7 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty calculations for TRP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for TRP
and offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone is the
standard deviation of the various efficiency measurement results that
are based on the 7 different reference AUT positions, the respective
reference AUT orientations, and the two reference AUT polarization
orientations.

O.2.8 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty for EIRP/EIS
----------------------------------------------------------------

The MU for the quality of the quiet zone for EIRP/EIS includes the
additional MU element of the directivity of the DUT and measurement
antennas as shown in Figure O.2.9-1. The EIRP/EIS measurements are
taking the peak gains of the respective antennas into account with the
reference AUT placed in the centre of the quiet zone. Once the antenna
is displaced in directions other than the measurement antenna, the
direct line-of-sight link is taking reduced antenna gains into account.
The type of reference AUT should therefore have similar pattern
properties as typical UE antennas. For systems with very large range
lengths, the directivity MU will be insignificant.

The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for
EIRP/EIS, offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone, and
directivity is the standard deviation of the single-point gain
measurement results that are based on the 7 different reference AUT
positions, the respective reference AUT orientations, and the two
reference AUT polarization orientations.

O.3 Procedure to characterize the spurious emissions quality of the quiet zone for the permitted far field methods
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure is mandatory before the spurious emissions test system is
commissioned for certification tests and characterizes the quiet zone
performance of the anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of
reflections within the anechoic chamber including any positioners and
support structures. Additionally, it includes the effect of offsetting
the directive antenna array inside a DUT from the centre of the quiet
zone, i.e., the centre of rotation of the DUT and measurement antenna
positioning systems.

The quiet zone is illustrated in Figure O.2-1 which includes the
definitions of centre of quiet zone range, i.e., the geometric centre of
the positioning systems, and the range length, i.e., the distance
between the centre of the quiet zone and the aperture of the measurement
antenna.

The outcome of the procedures can be used to predict the variation of
the TRP measurements, spherical surface integrals of EIRP, when the DUT
is placed anywhere within the quiet zone and with the beam formed in any
arbitrary direction inside the chamber

The reference coordinate system defined in Annex N applies to this
procedure.

### O.3.1 Equipment used

The reference antenna under test (AUT) that is placed at various
locations within the quiet zone shall be a directive antenna with a
half-power beam width (HPBW) of ≥ 20^o^ in E-Plane and H-Plane. The
HPBWs met based on antenna vendors' calibration report or datasheet.

For the measurement, a combination of signal generator and spectrum
analyser or a network analyser can be used. The multi-port (with three
ports) network analyser is most suitable to reduce test time as both
polarizations of the measurement antenna can be measured simultaneously,
and multiple frequencies can be measured in a sweep.

### O.3.2 Test frequencies

Editor Note: Another test frequency of \[TBD\] GHz will be added as soon
as FR2 bands \>49 GHz are introduced.

The frequencies to characterize the quality of the quiet zone shall be
6, 12.75, 23.45, 40.8, 49.0, 66, 80, and 87 GHz. The quiet zone
validation analysis is performed for each frequency individually.

The measurements from the 23.45, 40.8, and 49.0 GHz in-band QoQZ
validation can be re-used provided that the reference antenna position
and orientation as well as the measurement frequency and measurement
antenna are identical in both cases.

### O.3.3 Reference measurements

The spurious emissions quality of the quiet zone measurements shall use
3D pattern measurements of the reference antenna patterns as they most
closely resemble the 3D/spherical surface measurements/integrals of
EIRP. Therefore, the quality of the quiet zone measurements for TRP
metrics shall be based on efficiency measurements.

The grid types for the TRP measurements shall meet the 0.25 dB maximum
standard uncertainty. The min number of grid points for the two grid
types are:

> \- 192 grid points for the constant step-size measurement grids

\- 100 grid points for the constant density measurement grids (charged
particle implementation)

### O.3.4 Size of the quiet zone

The size of the quiet zone within which the variations of measurements
are evaluated depends on the size of the DUT. For smartphones, the quiet
zone shall be considered a sphere with radius of R=10cm. For larger
smartphones and tablet type devices, the quiet zone shall be considered
a sphere with radius of R=15cm. Alternate quiet zone sizes can be
defined for even larger DUTs.

The quality of quiet zone procedure for systems supporting larger quiet
zone sizes can be performed for the largest quiet zone radius only and
the results can be applied to the smaller quiet zone radius. Performing
separate sets of quality of quiet zone measurements for different radii
is not precluded.

### O.3.5 Reference AUT positions

The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different
reference positions, shown in Figure O.2.5.1-1 and O.2.5.2-1

While position 1, P1, is the centre of the quiet zone, the remaining
positions, 2 through 7, are off-centre positions each displaced by the
radius of the quiet zone, *R*. The coordinates of the respective test
points are shown in Table O.2.5-1.

### O.3.5.1 Distributed-axes system

The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different
reference positions, shown in Figure O.2.5.1-1 for distributed-axes
systems.

The reference AUT positions inside a typical distributed-axes system are
shown in Figure O.2.5.1-2.

### O.3.5.2 Combined-axes system

The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different
reference positions, shown in Figure O.2.5.2-1 for combined-axes
systems.

The reference AUT positions inside a typical combined-axes system are
shown in Figure O.2.5.2-2.

### O.3.6 Reference AUT orientations

As different areas within the chamber could yield variations in the
field uniformity inside the quiet zone caused by reflections, it is
important to characterize the electromagnetic fields with the reference
antennas uniformly illuminating the anechoic chamber. However, in order
to keep the spurious emissions quality of the quiet zone
characterization manageable in terms of test time, the number of
orientations for the spurious emissions quality of quiet zone validation
is limited when compared to the number of orientations for the in-band
quality of quiet zone validation.

### O.3.6.1 Distributed-axes system

The reference measurements for the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna
positions shall be rotated around the *y* axis with 2 different angles
*β*, i.e., *β* = 0^o^ and 180^o^ and fixed *γ* = 0^o^. A graphical
illustration of the reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure
O.3.6.1-1 with a reference AUT placed at position 6, P6, for reference
antenna polarization *γ*~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure O.3.6.1-2 illustrates the
reference AUT orientations for the reference polarization *γ*~pol~ =
90^o^.

The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as

for the distributed-axes system. The matrices are defined in Annex J.2
of TS 38.101-2.

If the device re-positioning approach is adopted for the spurious
emissions test cases, i.e., two hemispheres are measured separately
which involves the DUT, while connected to the gNB emulator, to be
rotated by 180^o^ around its axis halfway through the test, the quality
of quiet zone analysis is sufficient only for *β * = 0^o^.

The positioner relative coordinates/orientations with respect to the
measurement antenna/reflector in the initial position shall remain the
same for each reference antenna orientation, e.g., in the sample
distributed-axes system shown in Figure O.2.5.1-2 the reference antenna
shall be pointed at the positioner for *β* = 180^o^ for the initial
position of (θ,φ) of (0,0).

### O.3.6.2 Combined-axes system

The reference measurements for the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna
positions shall be rotated around the *x* axis with 2 different angles
β, i.e., β = 0^o^ and 180^o^ and fixed *α* = 0^o^. A graphical
illustration of the sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure
O.3.6.2-1 with a reference AUT placed at position 4, P4, for reference

reference AUT orientations for the reference polarization *γ*~pol~ =
90^o^.

O.3.7 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty calculations for TRP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The combined MU element related to the spurious emissions quality of the
quiet zone for TRP and offset between UE antenna array and centre of
quiet zone is the standard deviation of the various efficiency
measurement results that are based on the 7 different reference AUT
positions, the respective reference AUT orientations, and the two
reference AUT polarization orientations.

This annex contains the definitions of the bits in the field
*modifiedMPR-Behavior* indicated per supported NR band in the IE
*RF-Parameters* \[19\] by a UE supporting an MPR or A-MPR modified in a
given version of this specification. A modified MPR or A-MPR behaviour
can apply to a supported NR band in stand-alone operation (including CA
and NN-DC operation) or in non-standalone operation with the said NR
band as part of an EN-DC or NE-DC band combination. Moreover, the bits
in the field can explicitly indicate NS value(s) supported by a UE.

NOTE 1: In the present release, the *modifiedMPR-Behavior* is indicated
\[19\] by an 8-bit bitmap per supported NR band.

######## Annex Q (normative):

Difference of relative phase and power errors

Q.0 General
===========

This annex gives further information needed for understanding and
implementing 6.4D.4. The following terms should be understood as
follows:

\- Relative phase error: refers to the phase difference between signals
at different antenna ports, which should be ideally 0. It should be
understood as for a slot i.e. (slot) relative phase. It is calculated
based on DMRS symbols of that slot or on SRS symbols.

\- Difference of relative phase error: refers to the difference between
the relative phase error determined per slot and the relative phase
error determined based on the SRS transmitted.

Q.1 Measurement Point
=====================

Figure Q.1-1 shows the measurement point for the difference of relative
phase and power errors. To separate signals from the two transmitters,
it is necessary for the test equipment to perform joint demodulation by
inverting the 2x2 composite channel ('HGW') resulting from DUT precoding
'W' and antenna virtualization 'G' and OTA channel between DUT and test
equipment 'H'. Post processing refers to the calculation of the
phase/power errors, the averaging of phase and power errors per RB per
slot per channel port and the calculation of difference between relative
phases.

error for UL coherent MIMO

Q.2 Relative Phase Error Measurement
====================================

Here are listed the different aspects that may lead to different
interpretations.

Q.2.1 Symbols used
------------------

Phase error is determined based on DMRS REs (DMRS mapping type A with 3
DMRS symbols per slot, the REs corresponding to the odd subcarriers and
DMRS symbols are non-allocated for data or DMRS) and SRS REs (with 4 SRS
symbols in the SRS slot, same SRS resource mapping is used for
non-codebook-based and codebook-based precoding).

For the DMRS and SRS to occupy identical SCs and maximize their
frequency density, DMRS configuration type 1 and SRS comb2 configuration
are used.

UL RMC described in Annex A.2 is used.

Q.2.2 CFO (carrier frequency offset) correction
-----------------------------------------------

The TE performs a CFO correction on a slot-by-slot basis using a common
frequency correction at the two uplink layers.

Q.2.3 Steps of the measurement method
-------------------------------------

Below are detailed the steps necessary to obtain the maximum difference
of relative phase error during the 20ms time window.

1\. Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna port, the SRS
relative phase error based on the last SRS transmitted on Ant1 and Ant2,
that relative phase error serves as a reference for the calculation of
the difference of relative phase error for each slot inside the 20 ms
time window.

\- The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.

2\. Calculation for the last SRS transmitted, for each RB of the SRS
relative phase errors based on the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier SRS
relative phase errors determined in previous step.

\- The output is the "SRS relative phase error" vector for the last SRS
transmitted: $\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

3\. CFO correction on slot-by-slot basis using a common frequency
correction for both antenna ports.

4\. Determination for each subcarrier and at each antenna, the phase
over the slot being analyzed. The phase is extracted from the channel
estimate derived from the 3 DMRS symbols of the slot using the LSE
technique.

\- The output is one vector of dimension
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$ for each
antenna port.

5\. Calculation for a slot for each subcarrier of the relative phase
error (difference between the vectors determined in the previous step).

\- The output is subcarrier relative phase errors of a slot:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ subcarriers \right\rbrack$.

6\. Calculation for a slot, for each RB of the relative phase errors
based on the arithmetic mean of the subcarrier relative phase errors
determined in previous step.

\- The output is a "slot relative phase error" vector for a
slot:$\ \left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

7\. Calculation for a slot of the difference of relative phase errors
based on the "SRS relative phase error" (reference) determined in step 2
and the "slot relative phase error" determined in previous step.

\- The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector for a
slot:$\ \left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ RBs \right\rbrack$.

8\. Calculation for a slot of the arithmetic mean value of the
"difference of relative phase error" vector determined in previous step,
this value corresponds to an RB.

\- The output is a "difference of relative phase error" value for a
slot: $\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack.$

9\. Perform for each slot of the 20ms time window, steps 3 to 8.

\- The output is a "difference of relative phase error" vector:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times number\_ of\_ slots \right\rbrack$.

10\. Calculation of the maximum value of the "difference of relative
phase error".

\- The output is the "difference of relative phase error" that should be
verified as complying with the 40° maximum allowable difference of
relative phase error requirement:
$\left\lbrack 1 \times 1 \right\rbrack$.
