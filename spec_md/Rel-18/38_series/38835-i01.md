=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any,
in TR 21.905 \[1\].

***Field of view:** the angle of visible field expressed in degrees
measured from the focal point.*

**PDU Set**: A PDU Set is composed of one or more PDUs carrying the
payload of one unit of information generated at the application level
(e.g. a frame or video slice for XRM Services, as used in
TR 26.926 \[6\]). In some implementations all PDUs in a PDU Set are
needed by the application layer to use the corresponding unit of
information. In other implementations, the application layer can still
recover parts or all of the information unit, when some PDUs are
missing.

**Multi-modal Data**: Multi-modal Data is defined to describe the input
data from different kinds of devices/sensors or the output data to
different kinds of destinations (e.g. one or more UEs) required for the
same task or application. Multi-modal Data consists of more than one
Single-modal Data, and there is strong dependency among each
Single-modal Data. Single-modal Data can be seen as one type of data.

**Data Burst:** Data produced by the application in a short period of
time, comprising PDUs from one or more PDU Sets.

4 Introduction to Extended Reality
==================================

4.1 Extended Reality Types
--------------------------

*Extended Reality* (**XR**) refers to all real-and-virtual combined
environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer
technology and wearables. XR is an umbrella term for different types of
realities (see TR 26.918 \[5\] and TR 26.928 \[7\]):

\- Virtual reality (**VR**) is a rendered version of a delivered visual
and audio scene. The rendering is designed to mimic the visual and audio
sensory stimuli of the real world as naturally as possible to an
observer or user as they move within the limits defined by the
application. Virtual reality usually, but not necessarily, requires a
user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to completely replace the
user\'s field of view with a simulated visual component, and to wear
headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying audio. Some form
of head and motion tracking of the user in VR is usually also necessary
to allow the simulated visual and audio components to be updated in
order to ensure that, from the user\'s perspective, items and sound
sources remain consistent with the user\'s movements.

\- Augmented reality (**AR**) is when a user is provided with additional
information or artificially generated items or content overlaid upon
their current environment. Such additional information or content will
usually be visual and/or audible and their observation of their current
environment may be direct, with no intermediate sensing, processing and
rendering, or indirect, where their perception of their environment is
relayed via sensors and may be enhanced or processed.

\- Mixed reality (**MR**) is an advanced form of AR where some virtual
elements are inserted into the physical scene with the intent to provide
the illusion that these elements are part of the real scene.

*Other terms used in the context of XR are Immersion as the sense of
being surrounded by the virtual environment as well as Presence
providing the feeling of being physically and spatially located in the
virtual environment. The sense of presence provides significant minimum
performance requirements for different technologies such as tracking,
latency, persistency, resolution and optics.*

*This document uses the acronym XR throughout to refer to equipment,
applications and functions used for VR, AR and MR. Examples include, but
are not limited to HMDs for VR, optical see-through glasses and camera
see-through HMDs for AR and MR and mobile devices with positional
tracking and camera. They all offer some degree of spatial tracking and
the spatial tracking results in an interaction to view some form of
virtual content.*

4.2 Human Perception and Tracking
---------------------------------

For providing XR experiences that make the user feel *immersed* and
*present*, several relevant quality of experience factors have been
collected (see TR 26.926 \[7\]). Presence is the feeling of being
physically and spatially located in an environment. Presence is divided
into 2 types: Cognitive Presence and Perceptive Presence. Cognitive
Presence is the presence of one\'s mind. It can be achieved by watching
a compelling film or reading an engaging book. Cognitive Presence is
important for an immersive experience of any kind. Perceptive Presence
is the presence of one\'s senses. To accomplish perceptive presence,
one\'s senses, sights, sound, touch and smell, have to be tricked. To
create perceptive presence, the XR Device has to fool the user\'s
senses, most notably the audio-visual system. XR Devices achieve this
through positional tracking based on the movement. The goal of the
system is to maintain your sense of presence and avoid breaking it.
Perceptive Presence is the objective to be achieved by XR applications.

The Human field of view (**FoV**) is defined as the area of vision at a
given moment (with a fixed head). It is the angle of visible field
expressed in degrees measured from the focal point. The monocular FoV is
the angle of the visible field of one eye whereas the binocular FoV is
the combination of the two eyes fields (see TR 26.918 \[5\]). The
binocular horizontal FoV is around 200-220°, while the vertical one
around 135°. The central vision, which is about 60°, is also called the
comfort zone where sensibility to details is the most important.
Although less sensitive to definition, the peripheral vision is more
receptive to movements.

In XR, actions and interactions involve movements and gestures. Thereby,
the *Degrees of Freedom (**DoF**)* describe the number of independent
parameters used to define movement in the 3D space (see TR 26.928
\[7\]):

\- 3DoF: three rotational and un-limited movements around the X, Y and Z
axes (respectively pitch, yaw and roll). A typical use case is a user
sitting in a chair looking at 3D 360 VR content on an HMD.

Figure 4.2-1: 3DoF

\- 6DoF: 3DoF with full translational movements along X, Y and Z axes.
Beyond the 3DoF experience, it adds (i) moving up and down
(elevating/heaving); (ii) moving left and right (strafing/swaying); and
(iii) moving forward and backward (walking/surging). A typical use case
is a user freely walking through 3D 360 VR content (physically or via
dedicated user input means) displayed on an HMD.

Figure 4.2-2: 6DoF

An **XR View** describes a single view into an XR scene for a given
time. Each view corresponds to a display or portion of a display used by
an XR device to present the portion of the scene to the user.

An **XR Viewport** describes a viewport, or a rectangular region, of a
graphics surface. The XR viewport corresponds to the projection of the
XR View onto a target display. An XR viewport is predominantly defined
by the width and height of the rectangular dimensions of the viewport.

An **XR Pose** describes a *position* and *orientation* in space
relative to an XR Space. An essential element of XR is the spatial
tracking of the viewer pose.

4.3 Capture, Encoding and Delivery
----------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Video

XR content may be represented in different formats, e.g. panoramas or
spheres depending on the capabilities of the capture systems. Since
modern video coding standards are not designed to handle spherical
content. Projection is used for conversion of a spherical (or 360°)
video into a two-dimensional rectangular video before the encoding
stage. After projection, the obtained two-dimensional rectangular image
can be partitioned into regions (e.g. front, right, left, back, top,
bottom) that can be rearranged to generate \"packed\" frames to increase
coding efficiency or viewport dependent stream arrangement.

There are mainly three approaches that can be considered for 360 video
delivery (see TR 26.918 \[5\]):

\- Single stream approach: the single stream approach consists in
providing the full 360 video and showing the interesting part only.
Solutions that lie within this group have the drawback that either they
may not be scalable or they may impose a big challenge in terms of
required network resources (high bitrate of high resolution video) and
required processing at the client side (decode a very high resolution
video).

\- Multi-stream approach: the multi-stream approach consists of encoding
several streams, each of them emphasizing a given viewport and making
them available for the receiver, so that the receiver decides which
stream is delivered at each time instance.

\- Tiled stream approach: the tiled stream approach consists in
emphasizing the current user viewport through transmitting non-viewport
samples with decreased resolution. The tiles can be provided as one
common bitstream (using motion-constrained HEVC tiles) or as separate
video streams.

In modern video codecs (see S4-220505 \[13\]):

\- Complex prediction structures are used that take into account
application constraints, encoding complexity, latency and dynamic
decisions in the encoding. This may result in irregularities, for
example based on sequence properties. In particular for low-latency
delivery with error resiliency, different flavours of encoding
operations are in use, and the concept of I, P and B pictures is not
generally applicable.

\- All PDUs in a PDU Set are needed by the application layer to use the
corresponding unit of information in some implementations; while in some
others, receivers may use the data up to the first lost fragmentation
unit to recover at least parts of the video data and apply error
concealment afterward.

\- Furthermore, in motion-compensated predicted video decoding, some
frames refer to other frames based on the video encoding configuration
but also based on dynamic operational decisions. As a consequence, a PDU
Set may \"depend\" on previously received PDU Sets. However, such
dependencies do not necessarily result in discarding dependent
information units.

### 4.3.2 Audio

For Audio, we can distinguish channel-based and object-based
representations (see TR 26.918 \[5\]):

\- Channel-based representation using multiple microphones to capture
sounds from different directions and post-processing techniques are well
known in the industry, as they have been the standard for decades.

\- Object-based representations represent a complex auditory scene as a
collection of single audio elements, each comprising an audio waveform
and a set of associated parameters or metadata. The metadata embody the
artistic intent by specifying the transformation of each of the audio
elements to playback by the final reproduction system. Sound objects
generally use monophonic audio tracks that have been recorded or
synthesized through a process of sound design. These sound elements can
be further manipulated, so as to be positioned in a horizontal plane
around the listener, or in full three-dimensional space using positional
metadata.

4.4 XR Engines and Rendering
----------------------------

XR engines provide a middleware that abstracts hardware and software
functionalities for developers of XR applications (see TR 26.928 \[7\]).
Typical components include a rendering engine for graphics, an audio
engine for sound, and a physics engine for emulating the laws of
physics. In the remainder of this Technical Report, the term *XR engine*
is used to provide any type of typical XR functionalities as mentioned
above.

The processing of an XR engine is not exclusively carried out in the
device GPU. In power and resource constrained devices, it can be
assisted or split across the network through edge computing (see TR
22.842 \[2\]): the UE sends the sensor data in uplink direction to the
cloud side in a real time manner and when the cloud side receives the
sensor data, it performs rendering computing and produces the multimedia
data and then sends back to the user devices for display. This is where
NR can play an essential role.

4.5 Characteristics and Requirements
------------------------------------

### 4.5.1 General

**In general, the RTP layer can handle out-of-sequence reception of RTP
packets, and some codecs even require it for good operations (instead of
having to cope with increased delays to satisfy in-sequence delivery).
Thus, a mode of operation where the lower-layers on the receiver side do
not always enforce in-sequence delivery to upper layers is preferred
(see S4aR230035 \[17\]).**

**Other than that, i**t is difficult to identify characteristics common
for different XR applications since they heavily depend on the
application choices, such as the application itself, the codec in use,
the data formats and the encoding operation (see S4-220505 \[13\]). In
particular, low-latency XR and cloud gaming video services such as
Split-Rendering or Cloud Gaming typically would not use the traditional
coding structure with a fixed Group of-Picture (GOP). In addition, the
field of low-latency video delivery is undergoing heavy innovation and
new coding methods may be established frequently. Thus, the traffic
characteristics and requirements derived from the work done in SA4 (TR
26.926 \[6\] and TR 26.928 \[7\]) and listed below, can only be used as
a baseline when specific examples for XR traffic characteristics are
needed -- bearing in mind that they are not universally applicable for
all XR applications.

### 4.5.2 Video

The **frame rate** for XR video varies from 15 frames per second up to
90 or even 120 frames per second, with a typical minimum of 60 for VR
(see TR 26.918 \[5\] and TR 26.926 \[6\]).

According to TR 26.918 \[5\], the **latency** of action of the angular
or rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex is known to be of the order of 10
ms or in a range from 7-15 milliseconds and it seems reasonable that
this should represent a performance goal for XR systems. This results in
a motion-to-photon latency of less than 20 milliseconds, with 10ms being
given as a goal.

Regarding the **bit rates**, between 10 and 200Mbps can be expected for
XR depending on frame rate, resolution and codec efficiency (see TR
26.926 \[6\] and TR 26.928 \[7\]).

### 4.5.3 Audio

According to TR 26.918 \[5\], due to the relatively slower speed of
sound compared to that of light, it is natural that users are more
accustomed to, and therefore tolerant of, sound being relatively delayed
with respect to the video component than sound being relatively in
advance of the video component. Recent studies have led to
recommendations of an accuracy of between 15 ms (audio delayed) and 5 ms
(audio advanced) for the **synchronization**, with recommended absolute
limits of 60 ms (audio delayed) and 40 ms (audio advanced) for broadcast
video.

### 4.5.4 Pose Information

To maintain a reliable registration of the virtual world with the real
world, as well as to ensure accurate tracking of the XR Viewer pose, XR
applications require highly accurate, low-latency tracking of the device
at about 1kHz sampling frequency. The size of a XR Viewer Pose
associated to time, typically results in packets of size in the range of
30-100 bytes, such that the generated data is around several hundred
kbit/s if delivered over the network with latency requirements in the
range of 10-20ms (see TR 26.928 \[7\]).

Repeatedly providing the XR Viewer Pose for the same display time may
not necessarily return the same result (the prediction gets increasingly
accurate as the information is closer to the time when a prediction is
made) and there is a trade-off between providing several XR Viewer Pose
for a display time and using the same XR Viewer Pose for several
consecutive display times. However, it can be assumed that sending one
XR Viewer Pose aligned with the frame rate of the rendered video may be
sufficient, for example at 60fps (see S4-221626 \[16\]).

NOTE: In case the pose is used for pre-rendering in the network
(edge/cloud), an accurate and most recent pose information is
preferable.

Pose information has to be delivered with ultra-high reliability,
therefore, similar performance as URLLC is expected i.e. packet loss
rate should be lower than 10E-3 for uplink sensor data -- see S4-221626
\[16\].

5 XR Enhancements for NR
========================

5.1 XR Awareness
----------------

### 5.1.1 General

In both uplink and downlink, XR-Awareness contributes to optimizations
of gNB radio resource scheduling and relies at least on the notions of
PDU Set and Data Burst (see TR 23.700-60 \[9\]): a PDU Set is composed
of one or more PDUs carrying the payload of one unit of information
generated at the application level (e.g. a frame or video slice), while
a Data Burst is a set of data PDUs generated and sent by the application
in a short period of time.

NOTE 1: A Data Burst can be composed of multiple PDUs belonging to one
or multiple PDU Sets. During a Data Burst, periods of data transmission
inactivity should not be assumed. Although the duration of Data Bursts
may vary, it can be assumed that it stays within the same order of
magnitude. Also, the arrival time of the first packet of a data burst
cannot be provided by 5GC.

The following information may be provided by the CN to RAN (see TR
23.700-60 \[9\]):

\- Semi-static information per QoS flow:

\- Periodicity for UL and DL traffic of the QoS Flow provided via
TSCAI/TSCAC;

\- DL Traffic jitter information (e.g. jitter range) associated with
each periodicity of the QoS flow provided via TSCAI/TSCAC.

\- PDU Set QoS parameters of the QoS flow (i.e. applicable to all PDU
sets of the QoS flow) provided by the SMF via NGAP:

\- PDU Set Error Rate (PSER): defines an upper bound for a rate of
non-congestion related PDU Set losses between RAN and the UE (see TR
23.700-60 \[9\]).

NOTE 2: In this release, a PDU set is considered as successfully
delivered only when all PDUs of a PDU Set are delivered successfully,
and if the PSER is available, the usage of PSER supersedes the usage of
PER.

\- PDU Set Delay Budget (PSDB): time between reception of the first PDU
(at the UPF in DL, at the UE in UL) and the successful delivery of the
last arrived PDU of a PDU Set (at the UE in DL, at the UPF in UL). PSDB
is an optional parameter and when provided, the PSDB supersedes the PDB
(see TR 23.700-60 \[9\]).

\- PDU Set Integrated Handling Indication (PSIHI): indicates whether all
PDUs of the PDU Set are needed for the usage of PDU Set by application
layer.

\- PDU Set Information and Identification (dynamic information for DL
provided by user plane in GTP-U header):

\- PDU Set Sequence Number;

\- PDU Set Size in bytes (FFS);

\- PDU SN within a PDU Set;

\- Indication of End PDU of the PDU Set;

\- PDU Set Importance (PSI): identifies the relative importance of a PDU
Set compared to other PDU Sets within a QoS Flow. RAN may use it for PDU
Set level packet discarding in presence of congestion;

\- End of Data Burst indication in the header of the last PDU of the
Data Burst (optional).

For the uplink XR traffic, the UE needs to be able to identify PDU Set
and Data Bursts dynamically, including PSI, but in-band marking over Uu
of PDUs is not needed. Additional potential improvements to enhance the
scheduling of uplink resources are given in clause 5.3.2.

When the PSIHI is set for a QoS flow, as soon as one PDU of a PDU set is
known to be lost, the remaining PDUs of that PDU Set can be considered
as no longer needed by the application and may be subject to discard
operation (see clause 5.3.2).

NOTE 3: It cannot always be assumed that the remaining PDUs are not
useful and can safely be discarded.

NOTE 4: In case of Forward Error Correction (FEC), active discarding of
PDUs when assuming that a large enough number of packets have already
been transmitted for FEC to recover without the remaining PDUs is not
recommended as it might trigger an increase of FEC packets (see
S4aV220921 \[14\]).

### 5.1.2 Layer 2 Structure

Depending on how the mapping of PDU Sets onto QoS flows is done in the
NAS and how QoS flows are mapped onto DRBs in the AS, we can distinguish
the following alternatives (as depicted on Figure 5.1.2-1 below):

\- 111: one-to-one mapping between types of PDU Sets and QoS flows in
the NAS and one-to-one mapping between QoS flows and DRBs in the AS.
From a Layer 2 structure viewpoint, this alternative is already possible
and requires as many DRBs as types of PDU Sets. Providing different QoS
for the types of PDU Sets sent in different DRBs is already possible.

\- NN1: one-to-one mapping between types of PDU Sets and QoS flows in
the NAS and possible multiplexing of QoS flows in one DRB in the AS.
From a Layer 2 structure viewpoint, this alternative is already possible
but gives each QoS flows multiplexed in a DRB the same QoS. Providing
different QoS for the types of PDU Sets (i.e. QoS flows) multiplexed in
a single DRB is currently not possible.

\- N11: possible multiplexing of types of PDU Sets in one QoS flow in
the NAS and one-to-one mapping between QoS flows and DRBs in the AS.
From a Layer 2 structure viewpoint, this alternative is already possible
but gives each QoS flow/DRB one QoS. Providing different QoS for the
types of PDU Sets multiplexed in a single QoS flow/DRB is currently not
possible.

\- N1N: possible multiplexing of types of PDU Sets in one QoS flow in
the NAS and demultiplexing of types of PDU Sets from one QoS flow on
multiple DRBs in the AS. From a Layer 2 structure viewpoint,
demultiplexing of types of PDU Sets from one QoS flow onto multiple DRBs
is currently not possible.

NOTE: The multiplexing of several types of PDU sets on the same QoS flow
is allowed by the CN.

Figure 5.1.2-1: Mapping Alternatives

When comparing these alternatives, it was agreed that a QoS flow cannot
be mapped onto multiple DRBs in the uplink, thereby excluding
alternative N1N. For the other alternatives, providing different QoS by
splitting PDU sets of one DRB to different RLC bearers will not be
possible i.e. that splitting a DRB onto multiple RLC entities will
remain limited to existing cases (e.g. duplication).

In addition, the notion of PDU Set does not impact the granularity of:

\- SDAP SDU handling: SDAP still maps every incoming SDU to a single PDU
for a single PDCP entity;

\- Retransmissions: HARQ still relies on MAC PDUs and ARQ on RLC PDUs.

In terms of logical channel prioritisation in uplink, changes due to PDU
prioritisation will not be introduced, e.g. delay criteria was
considered but agreed not to be pursued further unless fundamental
issues are identified.

5.2 Power Saving Techniques
---------------------------

### 5.2.1 Physical Layer Enhancements

The evaluation results for proposed and studied power saving enhancement
schemes are available in Annex B.2.

### 5.2.2 Layer 2 Enhancements

Most XR frame rates (15, 30, 45, 60, 72, 90 and 120fps) correspond to
periodicities which are not an integer (66.66, 33.33, 22.22, 16.66,
13.88, 11.11 and 8.33ms respectively). The corresponding support by DRX
will be dealt with in a semi-static manner at least (e.g. via RRC
signalling).

In addition, RRC pre-configuration and switching of configurations of
DRX can be considered for enhancements of XR power saving.

5.3 Capacity Improvements Techniques
------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Physical Layer Enhancements

The following enhancements for configured grant-based transmission are
recommended:

\- Multiple CG PUSCH transmission occasions in a period of a single CG
PUSCH configuration;

\- Dynamic indication of unused CG PUSCH occasion(s) based on UCI (e.g.,
CG-UCI or a new UCI) by the UE.

The corresponding capacity performance evaluation results are available
in Annex B.1.6.

The evaluation results for other proposed and studied capacity
enhancement schemes are available in Annex B.1.

### 5.3.2 Layer 2 Enhancements

In order to enhance the scheduling of uplink resources for XR, the
following improvements are envisioned:

\- One or more additional BS table(s) to reduce the quantisation errors
in BSR reporting (e.g. for high bit rates);

\- Delay knowledge of buffered data, consisting of e.g. remaining time,
and distinguishing how much data is buffered for which delay. It is to
be determined whether the delay information is reported as part of BSR
or as a new MAC CE. Also, how the delay information can be up to date
considering e.g. scheduling and transmission delays needs to be
investigated further.

\- Additional BSR triggering conditions to allow timely availability of
buffer status information can be investigated further.

\- Delivery of some assistance information (e.g. periodicity) reusing
TSCAI as a baseline. Whether additional mechanism is required can be
further considered with an assumption that all information may not be
always available at UE application.

\- Signalling of UL traffic arrival information from the UE to the gNB
e.g. to cope with jitter in case of tethering (FFS).

For PDCP discard operation in uplink, the timer-based discard operation
(when configured) should apply to all SDUs/PDUs belonging to the same
PDU Set. Furthermore, for a PDU Set in a QoS flow for which the PSIHI is
set, when one PDU of that PDU set is known to either be lost or
associated to a discarded SDU (see clause 5.1.1), all remaining PDUs of
that PDU Set could be discarded at the transmitter to free up radio
resources.

In case of congestion, the PSI may be used for PDU set discarding (see
clause 5.1.1) and in uplink, a PDU set discard mechanism taking the PSI
into account will be introduced.

In uplink, the usage of Configured Grant brings potential benefits for
XR services with the enhancements recommended in clause 5.3.1, while in
downlink, enhancements to Semi-Persistent scheduling are not foreseen to
bring any benefits.

NOTE: The layer 2 components of the mechanisms recommended in clause
5.3.1 will be specified.

6 Conclusions
=============

In conclusion of the study, the following enhancements for XR services
are recommended:

\- For XR Awareness:

\- Provisioning by CN of semi-static information per QoS flow (e.g. PDU
set QoS parameters), dynamic information per PDU set (PDU Set
information and Identification) and End of Data Burst indication (as per
TR 23.700-60 \[9\]);

\- Identifying by UE of PDU Sets, Data bursts and PSI;

\- Provisioning by UE of XR traffic assistance information e.g.
periodicity, UL traffic arrival information (FFS).

\- For Power Saving:

\- DRX support of XR frame rates corresponding to non-integer
periodicities (through at least semi-static mechanisms e.g. RRC
signalling).

\- For Capacity Enhancements:

\- Multiple CG PUSCH transmission occasions in a period of a single CG
PUSCH configuration;

\- Dynamic indication of unused CG PUSCH occasion(s) based on UCI by the
UE;

\- BSR enhancements including at least new BS Table(s);

\- Delay reporting of buffered data in uplink;

\- Discard operation of PDU Sets.

######## Annex A (informative): Evaluation Methodology

Rel-17 evaluation methodology for XR power saving and capacity
enhancements (see TR 38.838 \[8\]) is used as the baseline evaluation
methodology for UE power saving and capacity evaluation of Rel-18 XR.

System capacity is identified as KPI for capacity study, which is
defined as the maximum number of users per cell with at least Y % of UEs
being satisfied. A UE is declared as a satisfied UE if all considered
streams meet their own packet error rate (PER) and PDB requirements,
i.e., more than X% of packets are successfully transmitted within a
given air interface PDB. From Rel-17 XR evaluation methodology, baseline
parameters are Y= 90% and X = 99%.

For power saving evaluation, power saving gain and capacity gain are
calculated with respect to the AlwaysOn baseline unless otherwise noted.
Jitter in DL is assumed on unless otherwise noted.

In addition to the values for jitter in DL in Table 5.1-2 in TR 38.838
\[8\], the following statistical parameters can also be optionally
evaluated in Rel-18 XR SI.

NOTE: This optional assumption is not applicable to the evaluation of 90
FPS and above.

Table A-1: Statistical parameters to be optionally evaluated in Rel-18
XR SI

  Parameter          unit   Optional value for evaluation
  ------------------ ------ -------------------------------
  Mean               ms     0
  STD                ms     5
  Truncation range   ms     \[-8, 8\]

######## Annex B (informative): Evaluation Studies

B.1 Capacity performance evaluation results
===========================================

B.1.1 Multi-PDSCH scheduling by a single DCI
--------------------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results for
dynamic scheduling when multi-PDSCH is scheduled by a single DCI. Due to
large XR video frame as per 38.838, resources in a single slot may be
not enough to convey all the data of a frame, resulting in resource
allocation spanning more than one slot. Thereby, in this clause,
multi-PDSCH scheduling by a single DCI is evaluated to transmit XR video
frame over multiple slots.

The performance of single-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbol(s) are always
reserved for PDCCH transmission in each slot (scheme 1.1 in Tables
B.1.1-1,2,3) has been compared against various schemes for multi-PDSCH
scheduling. Particularly, the following schemes, where multi-PDSCH is
scheduled by a single DCI, have been evaluated:

\- Scheme 1.2: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where unoccupied CORESET in a
slot can be re-used for PDSCH transmission.

\- Scheme 1.3: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbol(s) are always
reserved for PDCCH transmission in each slot.

\- Scheme 1.4: Multi-PDSCH scheduling with FDRA enhancement - more than
one FDRA indication is contained in the scheduling DCI, each of which is
applied to one or more scheduled PDSCH.

\- Scheme 1.5: Multi-PDSCH scheduling enhancement with early HARQ-ACK
feedback - multiple PUCCHs may be considered where HARQ-ACK for the
earlier PDSCH(s) can be reported earlier than the later PDSCH(s)
scheduled by the same DCI, to reduce latency of HARQ-ACK feedback.

\- Scheme 1.6: Multi-PDSCH scheduling where single PDCCH schedules up to
4 PDSCHs and full flexibility in terms of resource (RB allocation) as
well as MCS for each of the 4 PDSCHs.

\- Scheme 1.7: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbols per slot are used
for PDCCH if there is at least one UE that needs to be scheduled with
first TB out of multiple TBs and 0 symbols per slot are used for PDCCH
if no UE with the first TB out of multiple TBs needs to be scheduled.

The performance results of the above schemes are reported in Table
B.1.1-1, Table B.1.1-2, Table B.1.1-3 in terms of the ratio of satisfied
users.

Based on the evaluation results in Table B.1.1-1 and Table B.1.1-3, the
following observations regarding multi-PDSCH scheduling by a single DCI
as compared to single PDSCH scheduling can be made:

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[vivo\] that the capacity is decreased from 9.8
UEs per cell with single-PDSCH scheduling to 8.81 UEs per cell with
multi-PDSCH scheduling, where 1 symbol is always reserved for PDCCH

observed from Source \[vivo\] that the capacity is increased from 9.8
UEs per cell with single-PDSCH scheduling to 10.37 UEs per cell with
multi-PDSCH scheduling, where unoccupied CORESET in a slot can be
re-used for PDSCH transmission (1 symbol for PDCCH transmission in each
slot) (capacity gain is 6%). For VR/AR single-stream traffic model,
45Mbps, 10ms PDB, the results show similar trend.

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[vivo\] that the capacity is decreased from 10.25
UEs per cell with single-PDSCH scheduling to 10.1 UEs per cell with
multi-PDSCH scheduling, where unoccupied CORESET in a slot can be
re-used for PDSCH transmission (0.5 for PDCCH transmission in each slot)
(capacity drop is -1.46%).

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[ZTE\] that the capacity is decreased from 9.1 UEs
per cell with single-PDSCH scheduling to 7.9 UEs per cell with
multi-PDSCH scheduling, where 2 symbols per slot are used for PDCCH if
there is at least one UE that needs to be scheduled with first TB out of
multiple TBs (capacity drop is -13%). For FR1, UMa scenario, the results
show similar trend.

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 60Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[ZTE\] that the capacity is increased from 3.4 UEs
per cell with single-PDSCH scheduling to 3.7 UEs per cell with
multi-PDSCH scheduling, where 2 symbols per slot are used for PDCCH if
there is at least one UE that needs to be scheduled with first TB out of
multiple TBs (capacity gain is 8%).

Based on the evaluation results in Table B.1.1-1 and Table B.1.1-2, the
following observations regarding enhanced multi-PDSCH scheduling by a
single DCI can be made:

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[vivo\] that the capacity is increased from 10.37
UEs per cell with multi-PDSCH scheduling to 10.59 UEs per cell with
multi-PDSCH scheduling enhancement of early HARQ-ACK feedback
(unoccupied CORESET in a slot can be re-used for PDSCH transmission, 1
symbol for PDCCH transmission in each slot) (capacity gain is 2.12%).

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[vivo\] that the capacity is increased from 10.37
UEs per cell with multi-PDSCH scheduling to 11.09 UEs per cell with
multi-PDSCH scheduling FDRA enhancement (unoccupied CORESET in a slot
can be re-used for PDSCH transmission, 1 symbol for PDCCH transmission
in each slot) (capacity gain is 7%).

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[InterDigital\] that the capacity is increased
from 5.3 UEs per cell with single-PDSCH scheduling to 7.2 UEs per cell
with multi-PDSCH scheduling, where single PDCCH schedules up to 4
PDSCHs/PUSCHs and full flexibility in terms of resource (RB allocation)
as well as MCS for each of the 4 PDSCHs/PUSCHs (capacity gain is 36%).

B.1.2 Cooperative MIMO via DL interference probing based on SRS enhancement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results for
cooperative MIMO in TDD with downlink interference probing via SRS and
precoding via bi-directional training (BiT). In TDD system, channel
UL-DL reciprocity is utilized to obtain DL channel state information for
improved performance of single-cell (non-cooperative) MU-MIMO. However,
inter-cell interference is still the bottleneck that limits further
capacity improvement.

The performance of MU-MIMO with zero forcing precoding (scheme 2.1 in
Tables B.1.2-1,2) has been compared against Cooperative MIMO with DL
interference probing (scheme 2.2 in Tables B.1.2-1,2).

Scheme 2.2: Cooperative MIMO with DL interference probing via SRS and
precoding via bi-directional training (BiT), is the scheme where SRS
triggering and transmission are enhanced to directly reflect DL
interference spatial information (utilizing UL-DL reciprocity). Each gNB
performs its own (MU) scheduling and instructs the scheduled UEs to
sound on the scheduled PRBs. Then by TDD reciprocity, a gNB seeing
strong UL interference from a certain spatial direction on the SRS
resources (for example, via estimating the UL spatial covariance matrix
of interference signals) implies that in DL transmission the gNB will
cause strong interference to UE(s) in that direction. The gNB can then
adjust the precoding for DL interference avoidance during the PDSCH
transmissions. Each gNB measures the corresponding UL SRS resources and
adjusts its DL precoding accordingly to achieve multi-cell DL
interference coordination/avoidance in a distributed way, and hence the
so-called \'Bi-directional Training\' (BiT).

The performance results are reported in B.1.2-1 and B.1.2-2 in terms of
the ratio of satisfied users.

B.1.3 Enhanced CQI for CBG-based transmissions
----------------------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
enhanced CQI (eCQI) for code block group (CBG)-based transmissions. The
use of CBG-based transmissions allows avoiding a re-transmission of the
full transport block in case the receiver fails to correctly decode the
full TB. A large size of one video frame as per TR 38.838, results in a
large TB(s) size to convey a video frame.

The performance of the current legacy link adaptation with TB-based
transmission legacy CQI reporting (scheme 3.1 in Table B.1.3-1) has been
compared against CBG-based transmission with eCQI (scheme 3.2 in Table
B.1.3-1). The legacy CQI corresponds to the highest supported MCS while
not exceeding a 10% BLER target for the TBs.

Scheme 3.2: eCQI is the scheme where UE estimates the highest supported
MCS (expressed via a CQI index), assuming that downlink transmissions
occupy a set of downlink physical resource blocks termed the CSI
reference resource with M code block groups, while the error probability
of at most N failed code block groups does not exceed P. Parameters M,
N, and P may be configured by the network, or fixed to values that are
attractive for XR services. The configuration of the UE to use eCQI may
be conducted with RRC signaling (note that configuration of current CQI
schemes for a UE to use is also via RRC). The reporting of the eCQI can
be in the form of an eCQI index (from current CQI tables \[TS38.214 -
Tables in 5.2.2.1\] or enhanced CQI tables) that will guide the gNB to
choose the supported modulation scheme, effective code rate, and overall
efficiency that for its PDSCH transmissions. For the CBG-based
transmission with eCQI, results are shown for parameter settings M=8
assuming either N=2 or N=4 and P= 50%.

The performance results are reported in Table B.1.3-1 in terms of the
ratio of satisfied users.

Based on the evaluation results in Table B.1.3-1, the following
observations can be made:

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream
traffic model, 30Mbps, 10ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and 32TxRU, it is
observed from Source \[Nokia\] that the capacity is increased from 5.45
UEs per cell with legacy CQI to 6.35 UEs per cell with eCQI, where the
error probability of at most N=4 failed code block groups out of 8 CBGs
does not exceed P = 50% (capacity gain is 17%). For N=2, the results
show similar trend.

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for Cloud Gaming
single-stream traffic model, 30Mbps, 15ms PDB, 60 FPS, with SU-MIMO and
32TxRU, it is observed from Source \[Nokia\] that the capacity is
increased from 6.31 UEs per cell with legacy CQI to 7.31 users per cell
with eCQI, where the error probability of at most N=4 failed code block
groups out of 8 CBGs does not exceed P = 50% (capacity gain is 16%). For
N=2, the results show similar trend.

\- For FR1, InH, DL, with 100MHz bandwidth for VR/AR single-stream

B.1.4 Enhanced CQI based on DMRS
--------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
DMRS-based enhanced CQI reporting where the initial transmission is
based on legacy CQI reporting, while the retransmission is DMRS based
CQI reporting.

The performance of the current TB-based transmission with legacy CQI
reporting (scheme 4.1 in Tables B.1.4) has been compared against
CBG-based transmission (scheme 4.2 in Tables B.1.4) as well as TB-based
re-transmission and DMRS-based CQI (scheme 4.3 in Tables B.1.4):

\- Scheme 4.1: TB-based re-transmission (baseline scheme). In this
scheme, TB-based retransmission is applied with legacy CSI reporting.
Different outer-loop link adaptation configurations are used.

\- Scheme 4.2: CBG-based re-transmission. In this scheme, CBG-based
retransmission is applied with legacy CSI reporting. Different
outer-loop link adaptation configurations are used. The number of CBGs
per TB is equal to 8.

\- Scheme 4.3: TB-based re-transmission with DMRS-based CQI. In this
scheme, TB-based transmission/retransmission is applied where for the
initial TB transmission legacy CQI reporting is used, while for the
retransmission DMRS-based CQI reporting is used.

The performance results are reported in Table B.1.4-1 and Table B.1.4-2
in terms of the ratio of satisfied users.

B.1.5 Soft HARQ-ACK enhancements
--------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of soft
HARQ-ACK enhancements. HARQ allows to recover transport blocks that are
not successfully decoded by means of retransmissions. It can be
leveraged to use MCS close to what the radio channel can support while
maintaining high reliability. The gNB chooses the MCS for a transmission
based on its knowledge of the channel conditions, but it cannot always
precisely predict how they evolve.

The performance of Baseline HARQ-ACK (scheme 5.1 in Tables B.1.5-1,2,3)
has been compared against different schemes with soft HARQ-ACK.
Particularly, the following schemes, with soft HARQ-ACK, have been
evaluated:

\- Scheme 5.2: Soft HARQ-ACK indicating delta MCS: UE provides enhanced
HARQ-ACK feedback beyond the single bit ACK/NACK status in the form of a
Delta MCS based on PDSCH decoding. The soft HARQ-ACK feedback uses SINR
measurements done on each TB and link curves obtained from link level
simulations. Then the information the UE feeds back to the gNB is an
estimation of how far the experienced SINR is from the SINR that would
allow a reliable decoding of the TB.

\- Scheme 5.3: Soft HARQ-ACK indicating number of redundant
transmissions: 2-bit soft-HARQ feedback is reported by the UE and used
by the gNB scheduler. The 2-bit soft-HARQ feedback represents 4 states:
ACK, and NACK with n=1, 2, or 3, where \"n\" indicates how many
redundant transmissions are requested by the UE.

The performance results are reported in Table B.1.5-1, Table B.1.5-2,
Table B.1.5-3 in terms of the ratio of satisfied users.

B.1.6 Configured grant scheduling
---------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results for
configured grant scheduling. A UE can transmit UL data using CG
resources after configuration (of a CG Config Type 1) or activation (of
a CG Config Type 2), without the need of receiving UL grant from the
gNB.

The performance of dynamic grant (DG) scheduling has been compared
against configured grant (CG) scheduling. Particularly, the following
schemes have been evaluated:

\- Scheme 6.1.1: DG scheduling with SR followed by UL grant with BSR and
data. It is assumed that an SR is triggered upon arrival of a new XR
packet in the UE buffer. An UL resource is then granted to the UE to
transmit BSR and a number of UL data. A periodicity of SR and a size of
initial UL grant may vary and are indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1,
Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.1.2: DG scheduling with SR followed by UL grant with BSR
only. A periodicity of SR may vary and is indicated separately in Table
B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.2: Pre-scheduling dynamic grant: The scheduling is based on
dynamic grants where it is assumed that the network is provided with XR
traffic periodicity. An initial grant to the UE when its traffic is
expected is transmitted (implementation-based learning) without using
SR. A size of initial UL grant may vary and is indicated separately in
Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.3: Dynamic scheduling with genie BSR (DG with genie BSR):
The scheduling is based on dynamic grants where it is assumed BSR is
available with zero delay at the scheduler when a new XR packet arrives
in the UE buffer, to be used for indicating UL grants to the UE. Hence,
in this case, no SR or BSR delay is assumed.

\- Scheme 6.4: Single CG configuration, where single PUSCH occasion per
CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on
SR. In this scheme no scheduling delay is assumed. CG periodicity may
vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table
B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.5.1: Multiple CG configurations, where multiple PUSCH
occasions per CG period are pre-configured with certain periodicity
without relying on SR. In this scheme no scheduling delay is assumed. CG
periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table
B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.5.2: Multiple CG configurations, where multiple PUSCH
occasions per CG period are pre-configured with certain periodicity
without relying on SR. In this scheme scheduling delay for scheduling
more packets with DG is assumed as 2.5 ms. CG periodicity may vary and
is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.6.1: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling -- the scheduling is based on a
combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not
used. Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in UL
slot in order to transmit BSR and data when a new XR packet arrives.
Whenever a new XR packet arrives in the UE buffer, the UE uses the
nearest possible CG PUSCH occasion for BSR transmission and possibly
some amount of data. The network can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic
grants for the following data transmission. CG periodicity and size of
CG grant may vary and are indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table
B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.6.2: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling -- the scheduling is based on a
combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not
used. Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in order
to transmit BSR only when a new XR packet arrives. It is assumed that
one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain
periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets. Whenever a new XR
packet arrives in the UE buffer, the UE uses the nearest possible CG
PUSCH occasion for BSR transmission. The network can thus use the BSR to
provide dynamic grants for the corresponding data scheduling. CG
periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are indicated separately
in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.6.3: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling -- the scheduling is based on a
combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not
used. Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in UL
slot in order to transmit BSR and data when a new XR packet arrives.
Whenever a new XR packet arrives in the UE\'s buffer, the UE uses the
nearest possible CG PUSCH occasion for BSR transmission and possibly
some amount of data. The network can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic
grants for the following data transmission. *The PDCCH monitoring window
for the dynamic grant is pre-configured and associated with the CG*
PUSCH *occasion in each CG period.* The enhanced BSR that the BSR report
will be triggered at the first used CG PUSCH occasion in each CG period
to indicate to the gNB the remaining packet size is assumed. *If the BSR
is reported by the UE with the status \"not empty\", the UE would
monitor PDCCH in the subsequent slots for dynamic grant after XR packet
transmission with the CG resource, in which the dynamic grant is used to
schedule the* *remaining data of XR packet. If the BSR is reported by
the UE with the status \"empty\", the UE would not monitor PDCCH in the
subsequent slots of the PDCCH monitoring window for XR packet
transmission. Furthermore, if the XR packets are completely transmitted
during the monitoring window, the UE can be indicated to go to sleep. If
the XR packets arrive during the monitoring window, the UE can be
indicated to skip the PDCCH monitoring until the packets arrive.* CG
periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are indicated separately
in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.7: Enhanced CG with flexible resource allocation, where at
least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain
periodicity without relying on SR. In this scheme, it is assumed the UE
can indicate to gNB unused CG PUSCH resources via CG-UCI. CG periodicity
may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2,
Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.8: Enhanced CG with dynamic adaptation of CG parameters and
indication of unused/used CG PUSCH occasion(s). In this scheme, the UE
adjusts CG parameters dynamically: MCS, number of PRBs, number of layers
within the CG resource. The UE indicates these scheduling parameters to
the gNB via UCI transmitted separately in the same CG resource, and
whether the subsequent CG PUSCH occasions will be used/unused until next
XR packet arrival. It is assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG
period is pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR.
CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1,
Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.9: Enhanced CG with indication of unused/used CG PUSCH
occasion(s), where the UE only indicates if the subsequent CG PUSCH
occasions will be used/unused until next XR packet arrival. It is
assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured
with certain periodicity without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary
and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table
B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.10: Enhanced CG with MAC CE based dynamic resource
adjustment indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry MAC
CE based dynamic resource adjustment indication and video data, and
resource adjustment indication delay based on MAC CE is 2.5ms. It is
assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured
with certain periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets
without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated
separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.11: Enhanced CG with UCI based dynamic resource adjustment
indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry UCI based
dynamic resource adjustment indication and video data, and resource
adjustment indication delay based on UCI is 0.5ms. It is assumed that at
least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain
periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets without relying on
SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table
B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

\- Scheme 6.12: Enhanced CG with UCI based dynamic resource adjustment
indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry UCI based
dynamic resource adjustment indication only, and the dynamic resource
adjustment indication is used to inform the gNB data volume of an XR
packet or required resources to transmit the XR packet. Resource
adjustment indication delay based on UCI is 0.5ms. It is assumed that
one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain
periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR packets without relying on
SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in Table
B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

B.1.7 Scheduling restrictions due to RRM measurements
-----------------------------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results with
and without intra- and inter frequency RRM measurement restrictions.
Scheduling restrictions apply for the UEs during time-intervals where it
is performing intra-frequency RRM measurements at FR2, or gap assisted
inter-frequency RRM measurements. Such scheduling restrictions does not
allow to transmit PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS. When XR
frame arrival collides with RRM measurements, the XR frame will be
delayed for the duration of SMTC window or measurement gap (MG).

The performance with SMTC/MG scheduling restrictions (scheme 7.2 and 7.4
in Table B.1.7-1 and Table B.1.7-2) has been compared against no SMTC/MG
scheduling restrictions as well as with adaptation of MG period.
Particularly, the following schemes have been evaluated:

\- Scheme 7.1: Without SMTC scheduling restrictions. In this scheme, no
scheduling restrictions for FR2 intra-frequency measurements were
assumed. This can be realized via gNB-2-UE signalling to configure the
UE with time-mask where it shall always prioritize PDCCH/PDSCH decoding
and/or PUSCH transmission in line with XR traffic, even if colliding
with SMTC windows. Alternatively, the UE-to-gNB signalling to make the
gNB scheduler aware of when *s-MeasureConfig* induced scheduling
restrictions apply could be applied.

\- Scheme 7.2: With SMTC scheduling restrictions. In this scheme,
scheduling restrictions every 20 ms time period for an SMTC window of 5
ms for FR2 intra-frequency measurements were assumed. In case the SMTC
windows with scheduling restrictions collide with time periods where the
gNB would need to schedule the XR transmission, XR frame transmission
will be delayed.

\- Scheme 7.3: No scheduling restrictions during measurement gap. In
this scheme, no scheduling restrictions during measurement gap for
inter-frequency measurements were assumed.

\- Scheme 7.4: With scheduling restrictions during measurement gap. In
this scheme, scheduling restrictions for the duration of measurement gap
length of 6 ms are applied. Measurement gaps (MG) are configured to
allow UE to do inter-frequency neighbour cell measurement and the
corresponding RF tuning for RRM purposes (e.g. mobility, load balancing,
CA set-up). In case the MG with scheduling restrictions collide with
time periods where the gNB would need to schedule the XR transmission,
XR frame transmission will be delayed.

\- Scheme 7.5.1: Adaptation of MG period. The MG period is adapted to be
2 times when PCell RSRP is 2dB better than the best neighbour cell and 4
times when PCell RSRP is 4dB better than the best neighbour cell. The UE
speed is 30km/h.

\- Scheme 7.5.2 Adaptation of MG period. The MG period is adapted to be
4 times when PCell RSRP is 2dB better than the best neighbour cell and 8
times when PCell RSRP is 4dB better than the best neighbour cell. The UE
speed is 30km/h.

B.1.8 Buffer status report
--------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
enhancements related to buffer status report (BSR).

The performance of legacy BSR (scheme 8.1 in Table B.1.8-1 and Table
B.1.8-2) has been compared against enhanced BSR schemes. Particularly,
the following schemes have been evaluated:

\- Scheme 8.1: Legacy dynamic scheduling with legacy BSR.

\- Scheme 8.2: BSR with precise buffer size, where new buffer status
(BS) table(s) with finer granularity is designed.

\- Scheme 8.3: XR-specific triggering mechanism of BSR report. In this
scheme, the pre-scheduling dynamic grant based on the XR awareness is
considered and XR specific PDCCH monitoring is aligned with the
periodicity of XR packet generation. The BSR is also enhanced to have
XR-specific triggering mechanism of BSR report to minimize the
scheduling delay. The XR-specific BSR report triggering mechanism is
that the BSR report will be triggered at the 1^st^ PUSCH of each XR
packet at each cycle to inform gNB the remaining packet size to be
transmitted after the 1^st^ PUSCH transmission of the XR traffic. When
gNB receive the BSR, gNB would schedule UE the UL PUSCH transmission
until the completion of XR packet delivery in this cycle.

B.1.9 UL delay-aware scheduling
-------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
enhancements related to UL delay aware scheduling.

The performance proportional fair scheduling (scheme 9.1 in Table
B.1.9-1) has been compared against delay-aware scheduling. Particularly,
the following schemes have been evaluated:

\- Scheme 9.1: Proportional fair (PF) scheduling, where gNB uses PF
scheduling, i.e., the scheduling priority of each user is calculated as
the ratio of the instantaneous data rate over the historical data rate.
The gNB does not consider delay during scheduling.

\- Scheme 9.2: Delay-aware scheduling, where gNB is not aware of the
exact UL data arrival time and can only apply SR or BSR reception time
for delay-aware scheduling.

\- Scheme 9.3: Delay-aware scheduling, where gNB is aware of the exact
data arrival time and uses the exact data arrival time for delay-aware
scheduling.

\- For FR1, DU, UL, with 100MHz bandwidth for AR single-stream traffic

gNB is aware of the exact data arrival time (capacity gain is 19%).

B.1.10 XR-specific *playoutDelayForMediaStartup* for gNB scheduling awareness
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
enhancements related to gNB awareness about playoutDelayForMediaStartup
and appLayerBufferLevel, where the former is the waiting time that the
user experiences for media start-up and the latter is buffer level,
which indicates the playout duration for which media data of all active
media components is available starting from the current playout time,
where.

The performance dynamic grant scheduling (scheme 10.1 in Table B.1.10-1)
has been compared against the scheme with playoutDelayForMediaStartup
and appLayerBufferLevel awareness. Particularly, the following schemes
have been evaluated:

\- Scheme 10.1: Dynamic grant scheduling.

\- Scheme 10.2: XR-specific *playoutDelayForMediaStartup scheme. In this
scheme,* the ***playoutDelayForMediaStartup and appLayerBufferLevel***
is shared by the UE with the gNB. The scheme assumes, the feedback of
XR-specific ***playoutDelayForMediaStartup and appLayerBufferLevel from
UE*** would give the gNB scheduler additional delay budget in scheduling
the XR data transmission to achieve additional link adaptation gain. For
example, when the ***reported appLayerBufferLevel is 3 frames, gNB
scheduler extends PDB for scheduling the XR packet on PDSCH for
additional 50 ms.*** gNB prioritizes the UE scheduling based on the
extended delay budged from the reported playout delay size and buffer
level, in which a group UEs in the same priority queue are with the same
length of playout delay.

B.2 Power saving performance evaluation results
===============================================

B.2.1 Enhanced CDRX for semi-static periodicity alignment
---------------------------------------------------------

This clause captures evaluation results for enhanced CDRX based on
semi-static periodicity alignment between CDRX and XR traffic. The
following evaluations were provided by companies:

\- Ericsson and Intel evaluated configuring shifts for the start offset
of CDRX On Duration and a number of DRX cycles after which the shifts
should be added.

\- Huawei evaluated configuring multiple start offsets for multiple On
Durations within each CDRX cycle to align with multiple XR data
arrivals.

\- vivo evaluated multiple DRX configurations with different
drx-StartOffset values.

\- vivo evaluated one DRX cycle can contain multiple DRX On Durations
based on single DRX configuration.

\- Ericsson, vivo, OPPO, CATT, Intel, ZTE and Nokia evaluated the CDRX
cycle pattern with multiple cycle values (e.g., {16ms, 17ms, 17ms} for
60fps XR video).

\- ZTE, MediaTek and Qualcomm evaluated uniform non-integer number CDRX
cycles with quantization operations in DRX formulas.

\- ZTE evaluated multiple CDRX configurations with staggered offsets to
align with multiple XR data arrivals.

NOTE: For enhanced CDRX with semi-static periodicity alignment,
different companies used different notations (e.g., \"Matched CDRX\",
\"eCDRX\", \"Enhanced C-DRX\") to refer to their specific method to
achieve periodicity alignment. There was no attempt to align notation.

B.2.5 Jitter handling by LP-WUS
-------------------------------

This clause captures evaluation results for LP-WUS based jitter handling

\- vivo and Xiaomi evaluated LP-WUS based wakeup mechanism for XR
traffic in presence of jitter, i.e., UE wakes up after a LP-WUS is
detected. LP-WUS evaluation methodologies such as power modelling of WUS
detection and gap between detected LP-WUS and UE wakeup are based on
their own assumptions.

B.2.7 Additional DRX active time
--------------------------------

This clause captures evaluation results for additional DRX active time.

\- ZTE evaluated the extension for additional active time if UE does not
receive UE specific data scheduled by a PDCCH CRC scrambled by the
XR-specific RNTI within current active time.

\- OPPO evaluated additional On Duration triggered by dynamic signaling
such as a DCI to receive data that arrives after the On Duration
expires.

\- Nokia evaluated the Extension of Active Time (EAT) to extend DRX
active time if XR frame does not arrive before the On Duration timer
expires.

\- vivo compared the additional DRX active time and R17 PDCCH monitoring
adaptation scheme.

B.2.8 Multiple active CDRX configurations
-----------------------------------------

This clause captures evaluation results for multiple active CDRX
configurations for multiple XR traffic flows.

\- Ericsson and InterDigital evaluated the multiple active CDRX
configurations separately for XR video and the other traffics.

\- vivo compared multiple active CDRX configurations and a single active
CDRX configuration with SPS or a single active CDRX configuration only.

B.2.9 Dynamic grant enhancement with XR-specific pre-scheduling
---------------------------------------------------------------

This clause captures evaluation results for dynamic grant enhancement
with XR-specific pre-scheduling:

\- CATT evaluated the pre-configured XR-specific PDCCH monitoring cycle
and monitoring window disassociated with C-DRX which is aligned with the
periodic XR packet generation cycle. UE is allowed to monitor PDCCH for
XR-specific PDCCH monitoring cycle at both DRX ON and OFF. CATT also
evaluated multicarrier solutions with one carrier for XR service and the
second carrier for eMBB service.

Based on the evaluation results in Table B.2.9-2, the following
observations can be made:

\- For FR1, DL only evaluation, InH, high load, multi-carrier, VR 30Mbps
traffic at 60fps with 10ms PDB, it is observed from CATT that:

\- Dynamic grant enhancement with XR-specific pre-scheduling scheme for
XR traffic carrier and IM traffic carrier provides:

\- mean power saving gain of 23.3% for the XR traffic carrier

\- mean power saving gain of 87.2% for the IM traffic carrier

\- mean capacity gain of -0.45% for the XR traffic carrier

\- enhanced C-DRX (16/17/17, 8, 4) as performance reference provides:

\- mean power saving gain of 19.0% for the XR traffic carrier

\- mean power saving gain of 27.4% for the IM traffic carrier

\- mean capacity gain of -100% for the XR traffic carrier

When XR and IM traffic transmitted in different carriers, the
semi-static C-DRX enhancement scheme with (16/17/17, 8, 4) degrade 59.8%
PSG of carrier with IM traffic compared with that of dynamic grant
enhancement with XR-specific pre-scheduling scheme.

B.2.10 SPS+DG with UE power saving scheme
-----------------------------------------

This clause captures evaluation results for the UE power saving scheme
of SPS enhancement with dynamic grant (DG):

\- CATT evaluated the periodic SPS occasion which provides wake-up
timing for XR UE during DRX OFF and subsequent dynamic grant window for
the transmission of XR packets. When XR packet arrives after the SPS
occasion, gNB could indicate UE to perform PDCCH skipping until XR
packet arrival and to transform to sleep state after XR packet
transmission finishes.

B.2.12 Enhancements to PDCCH skipping indication
------------------------------------------------

This clause captures evaluation results for various enhancements for the
PDCCH skipping indications:

\- Huawei and vivo evaluated the adaptive PDCCH skipping duration until
the earliest possible arrival time of the next frame, i.e., the next
jitter boundary position.

\- Xiaomi evaluated PDCCH skipping with four skipping durations.

\- CATT evaluated PDCCH skipping by introducing the go-to-sleep
indication for UE transition to the sleep state immediately.

\- Ericsson compared two cases by evaluations when CDRX is configured
with: i) Rel-17 PDCCH skipping with two durations only; ii) or enhanced
PDCCH skipping with arbitrary skipping duration covering the remaining
DRX active time.

######## Annex C (informative): RAN2 Study Item Agreements

C.1 RAN2\#119-e
===============

Agreements from RAN2\#119-e meeting:

\- RAN2 does not intend to ask RAN1 to change their simulation
assumptions.

\- RAN2 should take SA2/SA4 work into account.

\- RAN2 assumes that PDU Set based parameters and PDU Set related
information may be used for better support of XR services. RAN2 can
consider both UL and DL directions.

\- RAN2 will study PDU Set based parameters and PDU Set related
information handling in Network and UE.

\- RAN2 to adopt the current SA2 definition of PDU Set as an application
media unit as working assumption, subjected to further guidance from SA2
and SA4.

\- XR awareness discussion in RAN2 should consider PDU set
characteristics and how to use the information available on those (for
UL and/or DL). Can also consider how to handle data bursts.

\- RAN2 can study e.g. periodicity, arrival time, jitter and frame-size
variations for XR awareness to enable power savings and capacity
enhancements. Can study also how often such parameters change (i.e. how
dynamic they are).

\- RAN2 can consider how PDU sets can be mapped to DRBs (FFS if SA2
discussion on PDU set mapping to QoS (sub-)flows impacts this).

\- RAN2 to focus on the following issues for power saving, as well
necessary parameters XR-awareness to support such enhancements, i.e.:

\- DRX enhancements to address the issues of DRX cycle mismatch and
jitter;

\- Identify necessary parameters from CN for XR-awareness for power
saving.

\- Enhancements to Rel-17 PDCCH adaptation can be discussed based on
RAN1 feedback, if they have any RAN2 impact.

\- RAN2-specific aspects can be studied based on contributions (e.g.
multiple XR traffic flows with different periodicities, SFN wrap-around,
RAN2-specific CDRX aspects, ...).

\- As starting point, RAN2 can further discuss the solutions in TR
38.838 that can impact on L2 operation (e.g., BSR, LCP, assistance
information for scheduling, packet discarding, prioritization) for
XR-specific capacity improvement. RAN2-specific solutions are not
precluded (even if RAN1 hasn\'t discussed them before).

\- Enhancement to SPS/CG should be justified for XR scheduling and
should be evaluated against dynamic grant (DG) scheduling which should
be considered as baseline. Should justify why enhancements are needed.

\- RAN2 considers SPS enhancements may not be needed in Rel-18 XR since
PDCCH capacity is not assumed to be a problem for XR. FFS if SPS has
some power consumption benefits.

C.2 RAN2\#119bis-e
==================

Agreements from RAN2\#119bis-e meeting:

\- From RAN2 viewpoint, the following information would be useful for
PDU set handling in UL and DL:

\- Semi-static information (from CN to RAN): At least PSER and PSDB;

\- Dynamic information: At least identifying which PDU belongs to which
data burst/PDU set is also needed, including means to determine at least
PDU set boundaries.

\- Capture the models 1a/b, 2a/b (from
[R2-2209777](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_RAN/WG2_RL2/TSGR2_119bis-e/Docs/R2-2209777.zip))
in TR and indicate what is possible in current specifications and how.
FFS how LCH options work in each case.

\- SDAP maps each data packet in a PDU set to a single PDCP SDU, as in
legacy (i.e. each PDU is only mapped to a single SDU).

\- HARQ and RLC re-/transmissions for XR traffic are done as in legacy
(i.e. they are not based on XR PDU sets).

\- For UE transmitter, the PDCP discard should be performed per PDU set
basis.

\- For UE transmitter, the PDCP discard is managed per SDU for PDU set,
the PDCP entity discards all PDCP SDUs associated with the PDU set.

\- At least RRC pre-configuration and switching of configurations of DRX
could be considered for enhancements of XR power saving. Other solutions
are not precluded and can be further discussed.

\- Introduce new BS table(s) to reduce the quantisation errors (e.g. for
high bit rates). FFS how new BSR tables are created and how they impact
BSR formats (can be discussed in WI phase).

\- Delay information consists of at least \"remaining time\".

\- RAN2 considers a delay information is useful for XR. FFS if dynamic
reporting from UE to network (e.g. via BSR) is needed, or whether PSDB
is sufficient. If we have delay information, it needs to distinguish how
much data is buffered for which delay value. Stage-3 details (e.g.
what\'s contained, how the triggering is done) can be discussed in the
WI phase.

\- If we have delay information reporting, RAN2 aims to define how the
UE determines the \"remaining time\" in the delay information.

\- Current CG configurations can be reused for UL XR traffic. FFS if
enhancements are needed (RAN1 is already discussing something). RAN2 can
discuss this in the next meeting.

\- RAN2 can discuss potential enhancement to provide some assistant
information on UL XR traffic for CG configurations at the gNB. FFS
whether TSCAI can already provide all necessary information.

\- RAN2 discuss whether additional traffic or QoS related information on
downlink traffic beyond what has been agreed by SA2 needs to be provided
to RAN for UE power savings.

\- RAN2 study what traffic and QoS related information on uplink traffic
(e.g. counterpart of what has been agreed by SA2) should be provided to
RAN for UE power savings and how the information may be provided to RAN.

\- Capture in TR that traffic parameters and Jitter are semi-static
info.

\- Can capture also SA2 agreements related to how they impact RAN2.

C.3 RAN2\#120
=============

Agreements from RAN2\#120 meeting:

\- N1N excluded.

\- Splitting DRB into multiple LCH (DC like) FFS.

\- Should try to understand why we would need to treat PDU sets
differently over the radio and why different PDU sets are muxed over
same flows. Also need to understand need for reordering. LS to SA2/SA4
sent in R2-2213351.

\- Agree that UE identifies PDU Sets / Bursts.

\- In-band marking not needed. Further information considered if BSR is
not enough.

\- Handling of discard FFS.

\- Regarding making LCP delay aware:

\- If delay-aware LCP is introduced, need the ability to turn it off;

\- SRBs not impacted.

\- Not considered further unless fundamental issues are identified.

\- RAN2 to support timer-based discarding of UL transmit side of PDCP
PDU/SDUs of a PDU set. FFS how this is modelled in PDCP specification,
can be discussed in WI phase.

\- RAN2 aims to allow XR frame rates that correspond to non-integer
periodicities in at least semi-static manner (e.g. RRC). Details can be
left to WI phase.

\- RAN2 thinks we need one or more additional BSR table(s) for XR. FFS
whether these are static (=specified) or dynamic (e.g. generated,
differs according to some RRC parameter), can be discussed in WI phase.

\- RAN2 will introduce data volume information associated with delay
information (e.g. remaining time) in a MAC CE. FFS if this is extension
of BSR or new format. FFS how to do that (e.g. what exactly is reported)
and how to ensure this information is up-to-date e.g. considering UL
scheduling delay.

\- RAN2 needs to discuss additional BSR triggering conditions to allow
timely availability of buffer status information at gNB. This can be
discussed in WI phase.

\- RAN2 sees some benefit from CG to XR services. RAN2 will address
enhancements triggered by RAN1 work.

\- RAN2 agrees some assistance information can be beneficial (e.g.
periodicity, packet size). RAN2 assumes baseline could be TSCAI (pending
SA2 conclusions), can discuss during WI phase whether something
additional is needed on top of that. If any assistance information is
needed, its definition should be standardized.

\- RAN2 thinks all information may not be always available at UE
application.

C.4 RAN2\#121
=============

Agreements from RAN2\#121 meeting:

\- RAN2 thinks that how PSER is enforced is up to network
implementation.

\- Introduce UL PDU Set Importance. How UE derives this will be handled
in UE implementation.

\- Can indicate that in RAN2 considers PDU set concept applicable to
both UL and DL in LS to SA2.

\- RAN2 thinks UL jitter may be present for XR (e.g. for tethering use
cases). It is unclear how network would use UL jitter information
(depends on what would be signalled and would anyway be up to network
implementation).

\- RAN2 intends to support tethering use case for XR. This may require
signalling of some UL traffic arrival information from UE to network.

\- Since we already agreed to not support delay-aware LCP, RAN2 aims not
to introduce changes to LCP due to PDU prioritization.

\- RAN2 thinks PSI can be useful for PDU set-based discard. RAN2 aims to
introduce a mechanism to allow UE to handle discarding of packets with
different PSI in case of congestion. FFS for other cases.

\- Support of RLC bearer splitting should be limited to existing cases
(e.g. PDCP duplication), no new XR-specific functionality.
