This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS
38.115-1 \[7\] or TS 38.115-2 \[8\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.115-1 \[7\]
and TS 38.115-2 \[8\] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are
individually calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to
relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test
requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements,
the test tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
\[6\].

4.2 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points

LA rated output power limits as in table 6.2.1-1.

### 4.3A.2 Network controlled repeater class for uplink and MT

The requirements in this specification apply to uplink Wide Area NCR and
uplink Local Area NCR unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment
scenarios for each class are exactly the same for NCR with and without
connectors.

For *NCR type 1-C, type 1-H* and *type 2-O*, NCR uplink classes and MT
classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area NCR are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

\- Local Area NCR are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

Table 4.5-1a: *Void*

Table 4.5-1b: *Void*

4.6 Requirements for contiguous and *non-contiguous spectrum*
-------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a repeater operates can either be contiguous
or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the
present specification apply for repeater configured for both contiguous
spectrum operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For repeater operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements
apply at the repeater *passband* edges. For each such requirement, it is
stated how the limits apply relative to the repeater *gap between
passbands* and the *Inter-passband gap* respectively.

For NCR operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply at
the NCR-Fwd *passband* edges or NCR-MT carrier edges. For each such
requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the NCR *gap
between passbands* and the *Inter-passband gap* respectively.

4.7 Requirements for repeater capable of multi-band operation
-------------------------------------------------------------

For multi-band connector or multi-band RIB, the RF requirements in
clauses 6 and 7 apply separately to each supported operating band unless
otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly stated that
specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at multi-band
connector(s), and multi-band RIB(s) as detailed in the requirement
clause. For repeater or NCR capable of multi-band operation, various
structures in terms of combinations of different downlink and uplink
implementations (multi-band or single band) with mapping to one or more
*antenna connectors* for *repeater type 1-C, NCR type 1-C, type 1-H* in
different ways are possible. For multi-band connector(s) the exclusions
or provisions for multi-band apply. For single-band connector(s), the
following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, output intermodulation, ACRR and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the repeater or NCR is configured for single-band operation,
single-band requirements shall apply to this *antenna connector*
configured for single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for
multi-band capable repeater or NCR are applicable. Single-band
requirements are tested separately at the *antenna connector* configured
for single-band operation, with all other *antenna connectors*
terminated.

5 Operating bands
=================

5.1 General
-----------

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the
*operating bands* defined in the present release of specifications.

> NOTE: Other *operating bands* may be considered in future releases.

Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in
which NR can operate according to the present version of the
specification are identified as described in table 5.1-1.

Table 5.1-1: Definition of frequency ranges

  Frequency range designation   Corresponding frequency range   
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------- ------------------------
  FR1                           410 MHz -- 7125 MHz             
  FR2                           FR2-1                           24250 MHz -- 52600 MHz
                                FR2-2                           52600 MHz -- 71000 MHz

Whenever FR2 is referred, both FR2-1 and FR2-2 frequency sub-ranges
shall be applied, unless otherwise stated.

5.2 Operating bands
-------------------

Repeater is designed to operate in the *operating bands* in FR1 and
FR2-1 defined in TS 38.104 \[2\] except the operating bands n46, n96 and
n102.

5.3 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 5.3.1 Channel raster

#### 5.3.1.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster

For repeater and NCR-Fwd, the NR-ARFCN and channel raster is the same as
specified for BS in TS 38.104 \[2\], subclause 5.4.2.1.

For NCR-MT, the NR-ARFCN and channel raster is the same as specified for
UE in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] for FR1 in subclause 5.4.2.1 and in TS 38.101-2
\[14\] for FR2-1 in subclause 5.4.2.1.

5.4 NCR-MT channel bandwidth
----------------------------

### 5.4.1 General

The NCR-MT supports a single NR RF carrier per passband in the uplink or
downlink in this release. From a BS perspective, different NCR-MT
channel bandwidths may be supported within the same spectrum for
transmitting to and receiving from NCR-MT connected to the BS.
Transmission of multiple carriers to different NCR-MT within the BS
channel bandwidth can be supported.

From a NCR-MT perspective, the NCR-MT per passband is configured with
one carrier and NCR-MT is configured with one or more BWPs. The NCR-MT
does not need to be aware of the BS channel bandwidth or how the BS
allocates bandwidth to different NCR-MT.

The placement of the NCR-MT channel bandwidth is flexible but can only
be completely within the BS channel bandwidth.

The relationship between the NCR-MT channel bandwidth, the guardband and
the transmission bandwidth configuration is shown in Figure 5.4.1-1.

Figure 5.4.1-1: Definition of channel bandwidth and transmission
bandwidth configuration for one NR channel

### 5.4.2 Transmission bandwidth configuration

For NCR-MT, the transmission bandwidth configuration is the same as
specified for UE in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] for FR1 in subclause 5.3.2 and in
TS 38.101-2 \[14\] for FR2-1 in subclause 5.3.2.

### 5.4.3 Minimum guardband and transmission bandwidth configuration

For NCR-MT, the minimum guardband and transmission bandwidth
configuration is the same as specified for UE in TS38.101-1 \[13\] for
FR1 and in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] for FR2-1 in subclause 5.3.3.

### 5.4.4 RB alignment

For NCR-MT, the RB alignment is the same as specified for UE in
TS38.101-1 \[13\] for FR1 in subclause 5.3.4 and in TS 38.101-2 \[14\]
for FR2-1 in subclause 5.3.4

### 5.4.5 NCR-MT channel bandwidth per operating band

For NCR-MT, the channel bandwidth for NR bands for FR1 in Table 5.2-1 is
the same as specified for UE in TS38.101-1 \[13\] in subclause 5.3.5 and
is the same as specified for UE in TS38.101-2 \[14\] in subclause 5.3.5.

6 Conducted characteristics
===========================

6.1 General
-----------

Clause 6 includes the conducted characteristics for both transmitter and
receiver.

For conducted transmitter characteristics:

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at:

\- Antenna connector for repeater type 1-C and *NCR type 1-C* (including
Fwd and MT interfaces) configuration,

\- *TAB connector* for *NCR type 1-H* (including Fwd and MT interfaces)
in normal operating conditions.

Requirements apply in both DL and UL unless otherwise stated or
declared.

For the DL the *antenna connector* or the *TAB connector* on the BS side
is the input and the *antenna connector* or the *TAB connector* on the
UE side is the output.

For the UL the *antenna connector* or the *TAB connector* on the UE side
is the input and the *antenna connector* or the *TAB connector* on the
BS side is the output.

All requirements are defined for normal conditions, unless otherwise
stated.

For conducted receiver characteristics:

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at *antenna connector*
for *NCR type 1-C and TAB connector for NCR type 1-H*, with full
complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 6:

\- Requirements apply during the receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the conducted receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *passband*
edge or *inter-passband gap*, and the positive offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the upper *passband* edge or
*inter-passband gap*.

NOTE: In normal operating condition the NCR-MT in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

6.2 Repeater output power
-------------------------

### 6.2.1 General

The repeater conducted output power requirement is at the *antenna
connector*.

The *rated passband output power* of the *RF* *repeater type 1-C and
NCR-Fwd type 1-C* shall be as specified in table 6.2.1-1 and table

6.4 Out of band gain
--------------------

### 6.4.1 General

Out of band gain refers to the gain of the repeater outside the
*passband*.

The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in-band
signals and not to amplify signals outside of the *passband*.

In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is
less than lowest expected the coupling loss to the nearest source of
emissions.

### 6.4.2 Minimum requirement for RF repeater

The gain outside the *passband* shall not exceed the maximum level
specified in table 6.4.2-1 or table 6.4.2-2, where:

\- f\_offset\_CW is the offset between the outer channel edge frequency
of the outer channel in the *passband* and a CW signal.

Table 6.4.2-1: Out of band gain limits 1 for bands below 2496 MHz

  --------------------------------- --------------
  Frequency offset, f\_offset\_CW   Maximum gain
  0,2 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 1,0 MHz    60 dB
  1,0 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 5,0 MHz    45 dB
  5,0 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 10,0 MHz   45 dB
  10,0 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW          35 dB
  --------------------------------- --------------

The gain defined between corresponding input/output TAB connectors
outside the *passband* shall not exceed the maximum level specified in
table 6.4.2-1 or table 6.4.2-2.

6.5 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[5\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *channel
bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as
harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and
frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the Repeater transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* of *repeater type 1-C* DL and uplink *operating band*
of *repeater type 1-C* UL, plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and
Δf~OBUE~ below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency
range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in tables 6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.5.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band of repeater type 1-C, NCR-Fwd type 1-C and NCR-Fwd type 1-H DL*

  Repeater or NCR type                       *Operating band* characteristics               Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)

  *Repeater type 1-C and NCR-Fwd type 1-C*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 200 MHz              10

  *NCR-Fwd type 1-H*                         F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz             10
                                             100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz    40

For *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied
per the *TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the configurations
supported by the repeater. The *basic limits* and corresponding
emissions scaling are defined in each relevant clause.

There is no co-location unwanted emission requirement for LA NCR-Fwd
type 1-C and repeaters type 1-C deployed in Femto cell scenario.

### 6.5.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.5.2.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *repeater type 1-C passband*
whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or
multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

For a *repeater* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.5.2.2 shall apply in *Gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.2-3, while the CACLR
requirement in clause 6.5.2.2 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.2-4.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.2
shall apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.5.2.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.2 shall
apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.5.2.2-4.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

#### 6.5.2.2 Limits and *basic limits*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For DL (all repeater classes), and for UL for WA class, either the ACLR
(CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.5.2.2-2, 6.5.2.2-5 or else
the relevant the ACLR (CACLR) *limits* in table 6.5.2.2-1, 6.5.2.2-3 or
6.5.2.2-4, whichever is less stringent, shall apply for each *antenna
connector*. For UL for LA class, the ACLR (CACLR) and *basic limits* in
table 6.5.2.2-1a, 6.5.2.2-3 or 6.5.2.2-4a shall apply.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a *gap
between passbands* or the *inter-passband gap* is the ratio of:

> a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
> frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
> between passbands* or the *inter-passband gap*, and
>
> b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
> one of the respective *repeater type 1-C passband edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.5.3.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.5.2.2-6.

CACLR shall also be applied in case NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT transmit
simultaneously in uplink and the NCR-Fwd passband and NCR-MT carrier are
not contiguous. In this case, the gap between the NCR-Fwd passband and
the NCR-MT carrier shall be considered in the same manner as a *gap
between passbands*.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for NR carriers located on either side of the *gap between passbands* or
the *inter-passband gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.5.2.2-4.

#### 6.5.2.3 Minimum requirement for *RF repeater*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* or the ACLR (CACLR) *limits*,
whichever is less stringent, shall apply for each *antenna connector*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be
applied to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna
connectors* for *repeater type 1-C*.

#### 6.5.2.4 Minimum requirement for *NCR*

##### 6.5.2.4.1 Minimum requirements for NCR-Fwd

##### 6.5.2.4.1.1 Minimum requirements for NCR-Fwd type 1-C {#minimum-requirements-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-c .H6}

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* or the ACLR (CACLR) *limits*,
whichever is less stringent, shall apply for each *antenna connector*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be
applied to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna
connectors* for NCR-Fwd *type 1-C*.

##### 6.5.2.4.1.2 Minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-h-3 .H6}

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* + X (where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) for DL and for WA UL and X=0 for LA UL)
or the ACLR (CACLR) *limits*, whichever is less stringent, shall apply
for each *TAB connector TX min cell group*. For joint transmission of
NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in uplink, the limits shall apply to the sum of
emissions from both NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.

NOTE: Conformance to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* ACLR requirement can be
demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The ratio of the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the assigned
channel frequency to the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent
channel frequency shall be greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic
limit* of the NCR-Fwd. This shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min
cell group*.

Or

2\) The ratio of the filtered mean power at the *TAB connector* centred
on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power at this
*TAB connector* centred on the adjacent channel frequency shall be
greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic limit* of the NCR-Fwd for every
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each *TAB
connector TX min cell group*.

In case the ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of *NCR-Fwd type 1-H*
are applied, the conformance can be demonstrated by meeting at least one
of the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the filtered mean power measured on each *TAB connector*
in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent channel
frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR (CACLR) absolute
ba*sic limit* + X of the NCR-Fwd. This shall apply to each *TAB*
connector *TX min cell group.*

Or

2\) The filtered mean power at each *TAB connector* centred on the
adjacent channel frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR
(CACLR) absolute *basic limit* + X of the NCR-Fwd scaled by X
-10log~10~(*n*) for every *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min
cell group*, for each *TAB connector TX min cell group*, where *n* is

### 6.5.3 Operating band unwanted emissions 

#### 6.5.3.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
*basic* limits for DL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
*basic* limits for UL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑2 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for *repeater* operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the *basic limits* apply inside any *gap between passbands*.
In addition, for a *repeater* operating in multiple bands, the *basic
limits* apply inside any *inter-passband* *gap*.

*Basic Limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band of repeater type 1-C DL and uplink operating
band of repeater type 1-C UL*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in tables
6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector of UL*, the operating band unwanted emission
basic limits apply also in a supported uplink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s)
transmitted in another supported uplink *operating band*. In this case,
no cumulative *basic limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a
supported uplink *operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a
supported uplink *operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- ∆f is the separation between the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation from the *repeater type 1-C passband
edge* frequency to the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *inter-passband gap* minus half of the
bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector of DL*, the operating band unwanted emission
basic limits apply also in a supported downlink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s)
transmitted in another supported downlink *operating band*. In this
case, no cumulative *basic limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap*
between a supported downlink *operating band* with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink *operating band* without any
carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission minimum requirement of the band
where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the
present clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission *basic limit* of
the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables
of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink *operating band*
without any carrier transmitted.

For a *multi-band connector of UL*, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported uplink *operating band* without any
carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted
in another supported uplink *operating band*. In this case, no
cumulative *basic limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a
supported uplink *operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a
supported uplink *operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the inter-band gap between a supported uplink operating band
with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\* Δf~OBUE~, f\_offsetmax
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported uplink operating bands and the operating band
unwanted emission *basic limit* of the band where there are carriers
transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply
across both uplink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission basic limits of
the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables
of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆fmax), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

In addition, inside any *gap between passbands* for a *single-band
connector* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined basic
limit shall be applied which is the cumulative sum of the basic limit
specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the *gap between
passbands*. The basic limit for each *sub-block* is specified in clauses
6.5.3.2.1 to 6.5.3.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

> \- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passbands* bandwidth
> minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.
>
> \- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of
> the measuring filter.

For Wide Area *repeater type 1-C*, the basic limits of either clause
6.5.3.2.1 (Category A limits) or clause 6.5.3.2.2 (Category B limits)
shall apply.

For Medium Range *repeater type 1-C*, the basic limits in clause
6.5.3.2.3 shall apply (Category A and B).

For Local Area *repeater type 1-C*, the basic limits of clause 6.5.3.2.4
shall apply (Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B basic limits shall be
the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.5.4.

In addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal
at DL input port, the basic limits in Table 6.5.2.2-2 shall apply. In
addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal at
UL input port, the basic limits in clause 6.5.3.2.6 shall apply.

##### 6.5.3.2.2 Basic limit for Wide Area *repeater type 1-C* (Category B)

For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options
for the *basic limits* that may be applied regionally. Either the *basic
limits* in clause 6.5.3.2.2.1 or clause 6.5.3.2.2.2 shall be applied.

##### 6.5.3.2.2.1 Category B basic limits (Option 1) {#category-b-basic-limits-option-1 .H6}

For *repeater type 1-C* operating in Bands n5, n8, n12, n20, n26, n28,
n29, n31, n67, n71, n72, n85, the basic limits are specified in table
6.5.3.2.2.1-1:

##### 6.5.3.2.5 Additional *basic limits*

##### 6.5.3.2.5.1 Limits in FCC Title 47 {#limits-in-fcc-title-47 .H6}

In addition to the basic limits in clauses 6.5.3.2.1, 6.5.3.2.2,
6.5.3.2.3 and 6.5.3.2.4, the *repeater type 1-C* may have to comply with
the applicable emission basic limits established by FCC Title 47 \[10\],
when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer.

##### 6.5.3.2.5.2 Protection of DTT {#protection-of-dtt .H6}

In certain regions the following basic limit may apply for protection of
DTT. For *repeater type 1-C* operating in Band n20, the level of
emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth
on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table 6.5.3.2.5.2-1, a
basic limit P~EM,N~ is declared by the manufacturer. This basic limit
applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range
falls in the spurious domain.

DTT

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
> isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
> emissions at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including
> antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides
> the characteristics of the repeater needed to verify compliance with
> the regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can
> be determined using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[20\], annex F.

##### 6.5.3.2.6 Basic limit inside passband with no UL input signal

The requirement is defined as a function of frequency offset from the
edge of some part of passband with non-zero input signal. The
requirement is measured as the ratio of the repeater output power in a
zero-input basic unit to the repeater output power in a non-zero input
basic unit. Basic unit equal to 360KHz.

The average of the basic limits over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed the
values specified in Table 6.5.3.2.6-1.

##### 6.5.3.3.1.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-C {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-c-3 .H6}

The operating band unwanted emissions for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* for each
*antenna connector* shall be below the applicable *basic limits* defined
in clause 6.5.3.2.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted
emissions limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over
all *antenna connectors* for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C.*

*For joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the
operating band unwanted emissions limits shall apply to the total
emissions from both the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.*

##### 6.5.3.3.1.2 Minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-h-4 .H6}

The operating band unwanted emissions requirements for *NCR-Fwd type
1-H* are that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each
applicable *basic limit* in clause 6.5.3.2, the power summation
emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell
group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) for DL and for UL WA and X=0
for UL LA.

*For joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the
operating band unwanted emissions limits shall apply to the total
emissions from both the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.*

NOTE: Conformance to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* spurious emission
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause
for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is
the number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

##### 6.5.3.3.2 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT

##### 6.5.3.3.2.1 Minimum requirements for NCR-MT type 1-C {#minimum-requirements-for-ncr-mt-type-1-c-1 .H6}

For LA NCR-MT type 1-C, regardless of simultaneous transmission with
NCR- Fwd is transmiting, the UE spectrum emission mask requirements
specified in clause 6.5.2 in TS 38.101-1 applies .

For WA NCR-MT type 1-C, regardless of simultaneous transmission between
NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd, the BS requirements specified in clause 6.6.4 in TS
38.104 apply.

For simultaneous transmission the limits apply for sum of NCR-MT
transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.

##### 6.5.3.3.2.2 Minimum requirements for NCR-MT type 1-H {#minimum-requirements-for-ncr-mt-type-1-h-1 .H6}

Limits for NCR-MT type 1-H apply to the sum of emissions across all TAB
connectors.

For LA NCR-MT type 1-H, regardless of simultaneous transmission with
NCR- Fwd is transmiting, the UE spectrum emission mask requirements
specified in clause 6.5.2 in TS 38.101-1 applies without scaling factor
allowed.

For WA NCR-MT type 1-H, the repeater basic requirements specified in
clause 6.6.4 in TS 38.104 relaxed with following scaling factor apply.

10log(*N~TXU,counted~*), where N~TXU,counted~ = min(N~TXU,active~ ,8)

For simultaneous transmission the limits apply for sum of NCR-MT
transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.

### 6.5.4 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.5.4.1 General

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding

\- the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each
supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, where the
Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1 for downlink, or

\- the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each
supported uplink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~
is defined in table 6.5.1-2 for uplink

For some *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating
band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[5\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *Repeater type 1-C* shall
not exceed the *minimum requirements* defined in clause 6.5.5.2.

#### 6.5.4.2 *Basic limits*

##### 6.5.4.2.1 General transmitter spurious emissions *basic limits*

The *basic limits* of either table 6.5.4.2.1-1, table 6.5.4.2.1-2
(Category A limits) or table 6.5.4.2.1-3 (Category B limits) shall
apply. The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall
be the same as for operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.5.3.

##### 6.5.4.2.2 Additional spurious emissions *basic limits*

These *basic limits* may be applied for the protection of system
operating in other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR *operating band*. It is
in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement
is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies,
since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of
regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.5.4.2.2-1
where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first
column apply for *repeater type 1-C*. For a *multi-band connector*, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.5.4.2.2-1 apply
for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted basic limits apply to a repeater
operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in table 6.5.4.2.3
-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the
downlink *operating band* (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this
excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.5.5.2.3 -1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: For unsynchronized operation, special co-existence requirements
may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For NR Band n28 repeater, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for repeater for co-existence with
E-UTRA Band 27 UL *operating band*.

NOTE 5: For NR Band n29 repeater, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for repeater for co-existence with
UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA
Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL
operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest repeater transmitter
frequency of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
clause 6.5.1.

The spurious emission *basic limit* for this requirement are:

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to repeater
operating in Band n50 and n75 within the 1432 -- 1452 MHz, and in Band
n51 and Band n76. The *basic limit are* specified in Table 6.5.4.2.3-4.
This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink *operating band* up
to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the repeater downlink
*operating band*.

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[12\], is defined in terms
of EIRP, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the
*antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.

The following requirement shall be applied to repeater operating in Band
n26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to
800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at
the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the
repeater downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the repeater downlink operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

Note: The regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC
reference document, 0007135419 are defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna
gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP~ =
P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the repeater unwanted emission level at
the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals the repeater antenna gain minus
feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement.

##### 6.5.4.2.3 Co-location with base stations and repeater Nodes

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS,
IAB-DU, IAB-MT and repeater receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900,
GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT, or
repeater are co-located.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with same class.

The *basic limits* are in table 6.5.4.2.3-1. Requirements for
co-location with a system listed in the first column apply, depending on
the declared class. For a *multi-band connector*, the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of table 6.5.4.2.3-1 shall apply for each
supported *operating band*.

Table 6.5.4.2.3-1: Spurious emissions minimum requirements for
co-location with BS, IAB-Node or repeater-Node

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.5.4.2.4-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit
frequency range. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow
a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[3\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.5.4.2.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would
be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

#### 6.5.4.3 Minimum requirement for *RF repeater*

The Tx spurious emissions for *repeater type 1-C* for each *antenna
connector* shall not exceed the *basic limits* specified in clause
6.5.4.2.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *repeater type 1-C* shall
not exceed the *basic limits* defined in clause 6.6.4.2.

#### 6.5.4.4 Minimum requirement for *NCR*

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd

##### 6.5.4.4.1.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-C {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-c-4 .H6}

The Tx spurious emissions for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* for each *antenna
connector* shall not exceed the *basic limits* specified in clause
6.5.4.2.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* shall not
exceed the *basic limits* defined in clause 6.6.5.2.

*For joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the
spurious emissions limits shall apply to the total emissions from both
the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.*

##### 6.5.4.4.1.2 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-H {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-h-5 .H6}

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* are that
for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic
limit* in clause 6.5.4.2, the power summation emissions at the *TAB
connectors* of the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell
group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) for DL and for WA UL and X=0
for LA UL, unless stated differently in regional regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* spurious emission
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause
for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is
the number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

*For joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the
spurious emissions limits shall apply to the total emissions from both
the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.*

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT

##### 6.5.4.4.2.1 Minimum requirements for NCR-MT type 1-C {#minimum-requirements-for-ncr-mt-type-1-c-2 .H6}

When NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.6.4 of TS 38.104 applies for WA NCR-MT type 1-C
and the requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for LA
NCR-MT type 1-C.

When NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the requirements
in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for LA NCR-MT type 1-C for sum of
NCR-MT transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.

##### 6.5.4.4.2.2 Minimum requirements for NCR-MT type 1-H {#minimum-requirements-for-ncr-mt-type-1-h-2 .H6}

Limits for NCR-MT type 1-H apply to the sum of emissions across all TAB
connectors.

When WA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.6.4 of TS 38.104 relaxed with the following
scaling factor applies for WA NCR-MT type 1-H.

10log(*N~TXU,counted~*), where N~TXU,counted~ = min(N~TXU,active~ ,8)

When WA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.6.4 of TS 38.104 relaxed with the following
scaling factor applies for the sum of NCR-MT transmission and NCR-Fwd
transmission.

When LA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for LA NCR-MT type
1-H without scaling factor allowed for the sum of the spurious
emissions.

When NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the requirements
in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 applies for sum of NCR-MT transmission
and NCR-Fwd transmission.

### 6.5.5 Receiver spurious emissions

#### 6.5.5.1 General

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector*. The requirements only apply to *repeater type 1-C* for TDD
operation.

For each a*ntenna connectors* on BS-side and UE-side supporting both RX
and TX in TDD, the requirements apply during the *transmitter OFF
state*. For *antenna connectors* both BS-side and UE-side in FDD, the RX
spurious emissions requirements are superseded by the TX spurious
emissions requirements, as specified in clause 6.5.4.

For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF state*, and are subject to exclusion zones
in each supported *operating band*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of receiver spurious
emissions requirements over all *antenna connectors* for *repeater type
1-C* shall not exceed *minimum requirements* defined in clause 6.5.5.2.

#### 6.5.5.2 Basic limits

The receiver spurious emissions requirements*, basic limits* are
provided in table 6.5.5.2-1.

6.6 Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
-----------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of repeater and the measured
signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the equalization by
the measurement equipment. This difference is called the error vector.
Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as
specified in TS 38.104 \[2\] Annex B for FR1. The repeater EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed in percent.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.1.1-1.

#### 6.6.1.3 Repeater EVM frame structure for measurement

The input signals for the repeater EVM requirement shall have the same
frame structure as defined for the BS is TS 38.104 \[2\].

### 6.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference
between the reference waveform provided at the input of repeater and the
measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is
called the error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is
determined are the same as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] Annex F for
FR1. Before calculating the repeater EVM the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the repeater EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the repeater EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement
specified in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM
waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT
and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the
repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference
power expressed as a %.

The basic repeater EVM measurement interval in one slot in the time
domain. The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols
that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval,
as defined in TS 38.101-1 \[13\] clause 6.3.3 for EVM for UE.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.2.1-1.

-------------------------

### 6.7.1 General requirement

#### 6.7.1.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the *passband*, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the
*passband*.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater
during the *transmitter ON state*.

There is no co-location input intermodulation requirement for LA 1-C
repeaters deployed in Femto cell scenario.

#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirement for *RF repeater*

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.1.2-1, the power in the
*passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured with 1 MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the *passband*.

Table 6.7.1.2-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals,
where:

\- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the
first or last channel in the *passband* of the closer carrier.

Table 6.7.1.2-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  1 MHz         -40 dBm                     2 CW carriers     1 MHz

#### 6.7.1.3 Minimum requirement for *NCR*

##### 6.7.1.3.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd

##### 6.7.1.3.1.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-C {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-c-7 .H6}

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.1.1-1, the power in the
*passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
NCR-Fwd as measured with 1 MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the *passband*.

Table 6.7.1.2-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals.

##### 6.7.1.3.1.2 Minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-h-8 .H6}

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.1.1-1, considering
corresponding input/output TAB connectors, the power in the *passband*
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the NCR-Fwd as
measured with 1 MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the level
obtained without interfering signals applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the *passband*.

Table 6.7.1.2-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals.

### 6.7.2 Co-location with BS/repeater in other systems

#### 6.7.2.1 General

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or
repeater operating in a different frequency band are co-located with a
repeater.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater. If
the BS side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the downlink. If
the UE side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the uplink.

#### 6.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for *RF repeater*

For the parameters specified in table 6.7.2.2-1 for DL and 6.7.2.2-2 for
UL, the power in the *passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB
at the output of the repeater as measured with 1MHz measurement
bandwidth, compared to the level obtained without interfering signals
applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the *passband*.

6.22 Receiver spurious emissions for NCR-MT
-------------------------------------------

### 6.22.1 General

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector for NCR-MT type 1-C and at the TAB connector for NCR-MT type
1-H*. The requirements apply to all NCR-MT with separate RX and TX *TAB
connectors*.

For *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements
apply during the *transmitter OFF period*.

For RX-only *multi-band* *connectors*, the spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*. For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF period*, and are subject to exclusion
zones in each supported *operating band*.

For *NCR-MT type 1-H* manufacturer shall declare *TAB connector RX min
cell groups*. Every *TAB connector* of *-NCR-MT type 1-H* supporting
reception in an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector RX min
cell group*, where mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells/beams is
implementation dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for Wide Area
*NCR-MT type 1-H* is calculated as follows:

N~RXU,counted~ = min(N~RXU,active~ , 8 )

NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units .

### 6.22.2 Minimum requirements for *NCR-MT type 1-C* and *type 1-H*

The receiver spurious emissions requirements for *NCR-MT type 1-C at the
antenna connector* and *NCR-MT type 1-H* are that for each *TAB
connector,* the power of emissions shall not exceed the value specified
in table 6.22.2-1.

7 Radiated characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

Clause 7 includes the radiated characteristics for both transmitter and
receiver.

For radiated transmitter characteristics:

Radiated transmitter characteristics are specified at RIB for *repeater
type 2-O, NCR- type 1-H* (including Fwd and MT interfaces)*,* and *NCR
type 2-O* (including Fwd and MT interfaces) including all its functional
components active and for all foreseen modes of operation unless
otherwise stated.

For radiated receiver characteristics:

Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for *NCR type 1-H
or NCR type 2-O*, with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for radiated
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements apply during the receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the conducted receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *passband*
edge or *inter-passband gap*, and the positive offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the upper *passband* edge or
*inter-passband gap*.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the NCR-MT in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

All requirements are defined for normal conditions, unless otherwise
stated.

7.2 OTA output power
--------------------

### 7.2.1 General

*Repeater type 2-O, NCR-Fwd type 2-O* are declared to support one or
more beams, as per manufacturer\'s declarations specified in TS 38.115-2
\[8\]. Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a
declared beam at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, beamwidth, *rated beam EIRP*,
*OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the maximum
steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
beamwidth(s).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the repeater is declared to radiate at
the associated *beam peak direction*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in TS 38.115-2 \[8\].

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *pass bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW) is
larger than 6%, two rated beam EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated beam EIRP
is:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

*For repeater type 2-O, NCR-Fwd type 2-O,* OTA repeater output power is
also declared as a TRP radiated requirement, with the output power
accuracy requirement defined at the RIB. TRP does not change with
beamforming settings as long as the *beam peak direction* is within the
*OTA peak directions set*. Thus, the TRP accuracy requirement shall be
met for any beamforming setting for which the *beam peak direction* is
within the *OTA peak directions set*.

There is no upper limit for the *rated TRP output power* and the *rated
beam EIRP output power* of *repeater type 2-O* DL transmission.

The *repeater rated TRP output power* and the *rated beam EIRP output
power* for *repeater type 2-O* UL transmission shall be within limits as
specified in table 7.2.1-1.

7.3 OTA frequency stability
---------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

Frequency stability is the ability to maintain the same frequency on the
output signal with respect to the input signal.

OTA frequency stability requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement for RF repeater

7.4 OTA out of band gain
------------------------

### 7.4.1 General

Out of band gain refers to the gain of the repeater outside the
*passband*.

The requirement is based on the ratio of TRP output power to directional
input power.

The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in-band
signals and not to amplify signals outside of the *passband*.

In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is
less than lowest expected the coupling loss to the nearest source of
emissions.

### 7.4.2 Minimum requirement for RF repeater

The gain outside the *passband* shall not exceed the maximum level
specified in table 7.4.2-1, where:

\- f\_offset\_CW is the offset between the outer channel edge frequency
of the outer channel in the *passband* and a CW signal.

Table 7.4.2-1: Out of band gain limits 1

  Frequency offset, f\_offset\_CW                                   Maximum gain
  ----------------------------------------------------------------- --------------
  0.1\*Minimum {400MHz, *passband* BW} ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 150 MHz   68 dB
  150 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 400 MHz                                55 dB
  400 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< f\_offset\_max                         35 dB

### 7.4.3 Minimum requirement for NCR

#### 7.4.3.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd

##### 7.4.3.1.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 2-O

The gain outside the *passband* shall not exceed the maximum level
specified in Table 7.4.2-1.

7.5 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 7.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[5\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *passband* resulting from the modulation process
and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *repeater type 2-O*
transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power
Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE). OTA Unwanted
emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious
emissions requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ are defined
in table 7.5.1-1and 7.5.1-2 for *repeater type 2-O* for NR *operating
bands*.

Table 7.5.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink *operating
band for repeater type 2-O and NCR-Fwd type 2-O DL*

+-------------------+------------------------------------+----------------+
| Repeater type     | *Operating band* characteristics   | Δf~OBUE~ (MHz) |
+===================+====================================+================+
| Repeater type 2-O | F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz | 1500           |
|                   |                                    |                |
| NCR-Fwd type 2-O  |                                    |                |
+-------------------+------------------------------------+----------------+

Table 7.5.1-2: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink *operating
band for repeater type 2-O and NCR-Fwd type 2-O UL*

  Repeater type                         *Operating band* characteristics     Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ----------------
  Repeater type 2-O, NCR-Fwd type 2-O   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz   1500

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* or co-location requirements as
described per requirement.

If the NCR supports simultaneous NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd transmission, then
the unwanted emissions requirements should be defined on the total
emissions from NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd.

### 7.5.2 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 7.5.2.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
state*.

#### 7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement for *RF repeater*

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 7.5.2.2-1 for DL and UL for
Wide Area class and DL for Local Area class.

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 7.5.2.2-1a for UL for Local
Area class.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit is specified in table 7.5.2.2-2.

Either the OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit in table 7.5.2.2-2 or
7.5.2.2-5 or the relevant ACLR (CACLR) limit in table 7.5.2.2-1,
7.5.2.2-1a, 7.5.2.2-3, 7.5.5.2-3a, 7.5.2.2-4 or 7.5.2.2-4a, whichever is
less stringent, shall apply.

For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA ACLR
requirement in table 7.5.2.2-3 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR
requirement in table 7.5.2.2-4 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *gap between passbands* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
between passbands*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *passband* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 7.5.2.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 7.5.2.2-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *gap between passbands* shall be higher
than the value specified in table 7.5.2.2-4.

##### 7.5.2.3.1.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd *type 2-O* {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-2-o-3 .H6}

The requirements in clause 7.5.2.2 apply for NCR-Fwd type 2-O. The
limits apply to the sum of emissions from NCR-MT and NCR-FWD when
transmitting simultaneously.

##### 7.5.2.3.2 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT

##### 7.5.2.3.2.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT type 2-O {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-mt-type-2-o-1 .H6}

6.5.2.3 in TS 38.101-2 apply.

For simultaneous transmission the limits apply for sum of NCR-MT
transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission

### 7.5.3 OTA operating band unwanted emissions

#### 7.5.3.1 General

The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as
TRP per RIB unless otherwise stated.

In addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal,
-13dBm/MHz shall apply for all classes DL and UL.

#### 7.5.3.2 Minimum requirement for RF repeater

##### 7.5.3.2.1 General

The requirements of either clause 7.5.3.2.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 7.5.3.2.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*repeater type 2-O*) in
clause 7.5.3.3.2. In addition, the limits in clause 7.5.3.2.4 may also
apply.

Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits.

For *repeater type 2-O*, unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 7.5.1-1 and 7.5.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in contiguous CA, the requirements
apply to the frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the edge of the
*passband.* In addition, for a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *gap between passbands*.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *passband*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 7.5.1-1
and 7.5.1-2..

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In addition, inside any *gap between passbands* for a *RIB* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the *limits* specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of
the *gap between passbands*. The *limit* for each *sub-block* is
specified in clauses 7.5.3.2.2 and 7.5.3.2.3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passbands* bandwidth
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 7.5.3.2.2 OTA operating band unwanted emission limits (Category A)

*Repeater type 2-O* unwanted emissions shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in tables 7.5.3.2.2‑1 and 7.5.3.2.2-2.

##### 7.5.4.2.3 Additional OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the repeater-Node. The limits
may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in
the same geographical area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.4.

##### 7.5.4.3.1.1 Minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-2-o-5 .H6}

The requirements in clause 7.5.4.2 apply. The limits apply to the sum of
emissions from NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd when transmitting simultaneously.

##### 7.5.4.3.2 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT

##### 7.5.4.3.2.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT Type 2-O {#minimum-requirement-for-ncr-mt-type-2-o-3 .H6}

For Wide Area *NCR-MT type 2-O*, the OTA TX spurious emission
requirements are as defined in clause 7.5.4.2.

For Local Area *NCR-MT type 2-O*, the OTA TX spurious emission
requirements defined for NR UE in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-2 \[14\]
apply.

### 7.5.5 OTA receiver spurious emissions

#### 7.5.5.1 General

The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from
the antenna array from a receiver unit.

The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions is *total
radiated power* (TRP), with the requirement defined at the RIB.

For a RIB operating in FDD, OTA RX spurious emissions requirement do not
apply as they are superseded by the OTA TX spurious emissions
requirement. This is due to the fact that TX and RX spurious emissions
cannot be distinguished in OTA domain.

For a RIB operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirement
shall apply during the *transmitter OFF state* only.

For *multi-band RIB*, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirements are
subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating band*.

#### 7.5.5.2 Minimum requirement for *RF repeater*

For the *Repeater type 2-O*, the power of any RX spurious emission shall
not exceed the limits in table 7.5.5.2-1.

7.6 OTA Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
---------------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 7.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of the repeater and the
measured signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the
equalization by the measurement equipment. This difference is called the
error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are same
as specified in TS 38.104 \[2\] Annex C for FR2. The repeater EVM result
is defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector
power to the mean reference power expressed in percent.

For repeater type 2-O, OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as
a *directional requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA
coverage range* on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of
the received signal is in the reference direction at the receive side.

For NCR-Fwd type 2-O, OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a
directional requirement at the RIB and shall be met within the OTA
coverage range on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of
the received signal is within the OTA REFSENS RoAoA at the receive side.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is
operating with an input power level within the range from what is
required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (P~rated,p,EIRP~) to
the minimum power levels in table 7.6.1.1-1.

The requirements in clause 7.6.1.2 apply for NCR-Fwd type 2-O.

#### 7.6.1.3 Repeater EVM frame structure for measurement

The input signals for the repeater EVM requirement shall have the same
frame structure as defined for the BS is TS 38.104 \[2\].

### 7.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 7.6.2.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference
between the reference waveform provided at the input of repeater and the
measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is
called the error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is
determined are the same as specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F for
FR2. Before calculating the repeater EVM, the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the repeater EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified
in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] clauses 6.4.2.4 and 6.4.2.5. For DFT-s-OFDM
waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT
and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the
repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference
power expressed as a %.

The basic repeater EVM measurement interval is one slot in the time
domain. The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols
that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval
as defined in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] clause 6.3.3.

All the parameters defined in clause 7.6.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F.

For *repeater type 2-O*, OTA modulation quality requirement is defined
as a *directional requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the
*OTA coverage range* on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident
wave of the received signal is in the reference direction at the receive
side.

For *NCR-Fwd type 2-O*, OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as
a directional requirement at the RIB and shall be met within the OTA
coverage range on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of
the received signal is within the OTA REFSENS RoAoA at the receive side.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable when the repeater is
operating with an input power level within the range from what is
required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power (P~rated,p,EIRP~) to
the minimum input power levels in table 7.6.2.1-1.

The requirements in clause 7.6.2.2 apply for *NCR-Fwd type 2-O*.

7.7 OTA input intermodulation
-----------------------------

### 7.7.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the *passband*, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the
*passband*. The requirement is defined as a directional requirement.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction:

The interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of polarization match.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater
during the *transmitter ON state*.

When GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or repeater operating in a different
frequency band are co-located with a NCR, additional input
intermodulation co-location requirement may be applied for the
protection of RF repeater or NCR receivers. This requirement applies to
the uplink and downlink of the repeater. If the BS side is declared to
meet co-location requirements, then it should meet input intermodulation
co-location requirements for the downlink. If the UE side is declared to
meet co-location requirements, then it should meet input intermodulation
co-location requirements for the uplink.

When GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or repeater operating in another
frequency band co-exist with a NCR, additional input intermodulation
co-existence requirement may be applied for the protection of NR
repeater or NCR receivers.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement for RF repeater

For the parameters specified in table 7.7.2-1, the power in the
*passband* shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured with 1 MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation
possibilities between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd
order intermodulation product to fall into the whole *passband*.

Table 7.7.2-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals,
where:

\- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the
first or last channel in the *passband* of the closer carrier.

\- G~RX\_ANT~ is the gain of the receive side antennas and is calculated
from EIRP and TRP declaration.

Table 7.7.2-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  1 MHz         -53dBm -- G~\_RX\_ANT~      2 CW carriers     1 MHz

### 7.7.3 Minimum requirement for NCR

#### 7.7.3.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd

##### 7.7.3.1.1 Minimum requirement for NCR-Fwd type 2-O

The requirements in clause 7.7.2 apply for NCR-Fwd type 2-O.

7.8 OTA Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
-----------------------------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average
gain over a carrier of the repeater in the *passband* to the average
gain of the repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater
*passband*. The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of
the Repeater. The bandwidth of the channel inside the *passband* and the
adjacent channel shall be of the same type (reference carrier) with
bandwidths as defined by *nominal channel bandwidth*.

The requirement is differentiated between downlink and uplink.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

The ACRR is a ratio of gain in the adjacent channel to gain in the
wanted channel. The gain in each case is defined as the ratio of TRP
output power to directional input power.

### 7.8.2 Minimum Requirements for RF repeater

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal in the *passband* and a received signal on an
adjacent channel outside repeater *passband* is from the same direction
and are the same as the TX reference direction for the opposite DL/UL
setting*.*

For a repeater operating at *passband* operating in FR2, the ACRR
requirements in table 7.8.2-1 shall apply in downlink. ACRR for downlink
shall be higher than the value specified in the Table 7.8.2-1.

### 7.8.3 Minimum Requirements for NCR

#### 7.8.3.1 Minimum Requirements for NCR-Fwd

##### 7.8.3.1.1 Minimum Requirements for NCR-Fwd type 2-O

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal in the *passband* and a received signal on an
adjacent channel outside repeater *passband* is from the same direction
and are the same as the TX reference direction for the opposite DL/UL
setting*.*

For *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* operating at *passband* operating in FR2, the
ACRR requirements in table 7.8.3.1.1-1 shall apply in downlink. In
normal conditions the ACRR for downlink shall be higher than the value
specified in the Table 7.8.3.1.1-1.

### 8.2.3 Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reporting requirements

#### 8.2.3.1 General

This clause includes conducted requirements for the reporting of channel
quality indicator (CQI) .

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
frequency non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting
variance and the BLER performance using the transport format indicated
by the reported CQI median. The purpose is to verify that the reported
CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214
\[28\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the reporting
definition is considered to be verified if the reporting accuracy is met
for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an offset of 1 dB.

###### 8.2.3.3.2.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 8.2.3.3.2.1 -1-1, the minimum
requirements are specified by the following:

a\) The reported CQI value according to the reference channel shall be
in the range of ±1 of the reported median more than 90% of the time.

b\) If the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by median CQI
is less than or equal to 0.1, then the BLER using the transport format
indicated by the (median CQI+1) shall be greater than 0.1. If the PDSCH
BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI is greater
than 0.1, then the BLER using transport format indicated by (median
CQI-1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

9 Radiated performance requirements
===================================

9.1 General
-----------

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *NCR-MT
type 2-O* to correctly demodulate radiated signals in various conditions
and configurations. Radiated performance requirements are specified at
the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the NCR-MT are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex B and the propagation
conditions in annex C.

The radiated performance requirements for the *NCR-MT type 2-O* are
limited to two OTA *demodulation branches* as described in clause 9.2.
Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches* depending on the number of polarizations supported by the
NCR-MT, with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.

NOTE 1: The NCR-MT can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*,
however OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches*.

Radiated performance requirements apply for a single carrier only.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the duration of a slot on a RIB

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

9.2 OTA demodulation branches
-----------------------------

If the *NCR-MT type 2-O* uses polarization diversity and has the ability
to maintain isolation between the signals for each of the *demodulation
branches*, then radiated performance requirements can be tested for up
to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test setups). When
tested for two *demodulation branches*, each demodulation branch maps to
one polarization.

If the *NCR-MT type 2-O* does not use polarization diversity then
radiated performance requirements can only be tested for a single
*demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

9.3 Demodulation performance requirements
-----------------------------------------

### 9.3.1 Performance requirements for NCR type 2-O

#### 9.3.1.1 Performance requirements for PDSCH

##### 9.3.1.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by (i) a minimum
required throughput for a given SNR and (ii) a minimum SNR at which 1%
first transmission BLER is achieved. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex B. The throughput requirements assume HARQ retransmissions whereas
the 1% BLER requirements are based on the first transmission only.

#### 9.4.1.3 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)

##### 9.4.1.3.1 General

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
frequency non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting
variance and the BLER performance using the transport format indicated
by the reported CQI median. The purpose is to verify that the reported
CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214
\[11\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the reporting
definition is considered to be verified if the reporting accuracy is met
for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an offset of 1 dB.

10 NCR-MT RRC\_CONNECTED state mobility
=======================================

10.1 RRC Connection Mobility Control for NCR-MT
-----------------------------------------------

### 10.1.1 SA: RRC Re-establishment

#### 10.1.1.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on the NCR-MT regarding RRC connection
re-establishment procedure. The requirements in this clause are
applicable only for local area (LA) NCR-MT.

RRC connection re-establishment is initiated when an NCR-MT in
RRC\_CONNECTED state loses RRC connection due to any of failure cases,
including radio link failure, handover failure, and RRC connection
reconfiguration failure. The RRC connection re-establishment procedure
is specified in clause 5.3.7 of TS 38.331 \[23\].

The requirements in this clause are applicable for RRC connection
re-establishment to NR cell.

#### 10.1.1.2 Requirements

In RRC\_CONNECTED state the NCR-MT shall be capable of sending
*RRCReestablishmentRequest* message within T~re-establish\_delay~
seconds from the moment it detects a loss in RRC connection. The total
RRC connection delay (T~re-establish\_delay~) shall be less than:

$$T_{\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} + T_{\text{UL}\_\text{grant}}$$

T~UL\_grant~: It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
grant from the target PCell. The uplink grant is required to transmit
*RRCReestablishmentRequest* message.

The NCR-MT re-establishment delay (T~NCR-MT\_re-establish\_delay~) is
specified in clause 10.1.1.2.1.

##### 10.1.1.2.1 NCR-MT Re-establishment delay requirement

The NCR-MT re-establishment delay (T~NCR-MT\_re-establish\_delay~) is
the time between the moments when any of the conditions requiring RRC
re-establishment as defined in clause 5.3.7 in TS 38.331 \[23\] is
detected by the NCR-MT and when the NCR-MT sends PRACH to the target
PCell. The NCR-MT re-establishment delay
(T~NCR-MT\_re-establish\_delay~) requirement shall be less than:

$$T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = 400\ ms + T_{\text{identify}\_\text{intra}\_\text{NR}} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{\text{identify}\_\text{inter}\_\text{NR},i} + T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

The intra-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable if
each relevant SSB can satisfy that:

\- the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex TBD for
the LA NCR-MT class and NCR type are fulfilled.

The inter-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable when
for each relevant SSB:

\- the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex TBD for
the LA NCR-MT class and NCR type are fulfilled.

T~identify\_intra\_NR~: It is the time to identify the target
intra-frequency NR cell and it depends on whether the target NR cell is
known cell or unknown cell and on the frequency range (FR) of the target
NR cell. If the NCR-MT is not configured with intra-frequency NR carrier
for RRC re-establishment then T~identify\_intra\_NR~=0; otherwise
T~identify\_intra\_NR~ shall not exceed the values defined in Table
10.1.1.2.1-1.

T~identify\_inter\_NR,i~: It is the time to identify the target
inter-frequency NR cell on inter-frequency carrier *i* configured for
RRC re-establishment and it depends on whether the target NR cell is
known cell or unknown cell and on the frequency range (FR) of the target
NR cell. T~identify\_inter\_NR,i~ shall not exceed the values defined in
Table 10.1.1.2.1-2.

T~SMTC~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the
intra-frequency carrier. If the NCR-MT has been provided with higher
layer signaling of *smtc2 \[23\]* then T~SMTC~ follows *smtc1* or
*smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the target cell.

T~SMTC,i~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the
inter-frequency carrier *i*. If the NCR-MT is not provided with SMTC
configuration then the NCR-MT may assume that the target SSB periodicity
is no larger than 20 ms.

T~SI-NR~: It is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure
delay of system information blocks defined in TS 38.331 \[23\] for the
target NR cell.

T~PRACH:~ It is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available
PRACH occasion in the target NR cell. T~PRACH~ can be up to the
summation of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to
PRACH occasion associated period is defined in clause 14 of TS 38.213
\[24\].

*N~freq~*: It is the total number of NR frequencies to be monitored for
RRC re-establishment; N~freq~ = 1 if the target intra-frequency NR cell
is known, else N~freq~ = 2 and T~identify\_intra\_NR~ = 0 if the target
inter-frequency NR cell is known.

There is no requirement if the target cell does not contain the NCR-MT
context or if the SSB transmission periodicity is larger than 20 ms.

In the requirement defined in the below tables, the target FR1 cell is
known if it has been meeting the relevant cell identification
requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise it is unknown.

### 10.1.2 Random access

#### 10.1.2.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on the NCR-MT regarding random access
procedure. The random access procedure is initiated to establish uplink

10.2 Timing
-----------

### 10.2.1 NCR-MT transmit timing

#### 10.2.1.1 Introduction

The NCR-MT shall have capability to follow the frame timing change of
the reference cell in connected state. The uplink frame transmission
takes place before the reception of the first detected path (in time) of
the corresponding downlink frame from the reference cell. NCR-MT shall
use the PCell as the reference cell for deriving the NCR-MT transmit
timing. NCR-MT initial transmit timing accuracy, gradual timing
adjustment requirements are defined in the following requirements.

#### 10.2.1.2 Requirements

The requirements in clause 10.2.1.2 apply for both wide area and local
area NCR-MT as defined in clause 4.3A.2.

The NCR-MT initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal
to ±T~e~ where the timing error limit value T~e~ is specified in Table
10.2.1.2-1. This requirement applies for PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS or it is
the PRACH transmission.

The NCR-MT shall meet the Te requirement for an initial transmission
provided that at least one SSB is available at the NCR-MT during the
last 160 ms. The reference point for the NCR-MT initial transmit timing
control requirement shall be the downlink timing of the reference cell
minus ![](./media/image17.wmf){width="1.2527777777777778in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}. The downlink timing is defined as the
time when the first path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame
used by the NCR-MT to determine downlink timing is received from the
reference cell at the NCR-MT antenna. *N*~TA~ for PRACH is defined as 0.

![](./media/image17.wmf){width="1.2527777777777778in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"} (in *T~c~* units) for other channels is
the difference between NCR-MT transmission timing and the downlink
timing immediately after when the last timing advance in clause 10.2.2
was applied. *N*~TA~ for other channels is not changed until next timing
advance is received. The value
of![](./media/image18.wmf){width="0.5472222222222223in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}depends on the duplex mode of the cell in
which the uplink transmission takes place and the frequency range (FR).
![](./media/image18.wmf){width="0.5472222222222223in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}is defined in Table 10.2.1.2-2.

The requirements in clause 10.2.2 apply for NCR-MT belonging to local
area NCR-MT class as defined in clause 4.3A.2.

#### 10.2.2.2 Requirements

For NCR-MT timers specified in TS 38.331 \[23\], the NCR-MT shall comply
with the timer accuracies according to Table 10.2.2.2-1.

The requirements are only related to the actual timing measurements
internally in the NCR-MT. They do not include the following:

\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. NCR-MT
reaction time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is
fulfilled), or

\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of an NCR-MT timer (e.g. slot alignment when NCR-MT sends
messages at timer expiry).

Table 10.2.2.2-1

  Timer value \[s\]   Accuracy
  ------------------- ----------
  timer value \< 4    ± 0.1s
  timer value ≥ 4     ± 2.5%

### 10.2.3 NCR-MT timing advance

#### 10.2.3.1 Introduction

The timing advance is initiated from gNB to NCR-MT, with MAC message
that implies the adjustment of the timing advance, as defined in
clause 5.2 of TS 38.321 \[25\]. The time advance adjustment requirement
for both wide area and local area NCR-MT as defined in clause 4.3A.2.

#### 10.2.3.2 Requirements

##### 10.2.3.2.1 Timing Advance adjustment delay

NCR-MT shall adjust the timing of its uplink transmission timing at time
slot *n*+ *k+1* for a timing advance command received in time slot *n*,
and the value of *k* is defined in clause 4.2 in TS 38.213 \[24\]. The
same requirement applies also when NCR-MT is not able to transmit a
configured uplink transmission due to the channel assessment procedure.

##### 10.2.3.2.2 Timing Advance adjustment accuracy

The NCR-MT shall adjust the timing of its transmissions with a relative
accuracy better than or equal to the NCR-MT Timing Advance adjustment
accuracy requirement in Table 10.2.3.2.2-1, to the signalled timing
advance value compared to the timing of preceding uplink transmission.
The timing advance command step is defined in TS 38.213 \[24\].

10.3 Signalling Characteristics for NCR-MT
------------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 Radio Link Monitoring

#### 10.3.1.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.3.1 apply for radio link monitoring of
local area NCR-MT class as defined in clause 4.3A.2 on:

\- PCell in SA NR,

The NCR-MT shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell as specified in
TS 38.213 \[24\]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or
all CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. NCR-MT is not required to
perform RLM outside the active DL BWP.

On each RLM-RS resource, the NCR-MT shall estimate the downlink radio
link quality and compare it to the thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the
purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell.

The threshold Q~out~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to the out-of-sync
block error rate (BLER~out~) as defined in Table 10.3.1-1. For SSB based
radio link monitoring, Q~out\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 10.3.1.2.1-1. For CSI-RS
based radio link monitoring, Q~out\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 10.3.1.3.1-1.

The threshold Q~in~ is defined as the level at which the downlink radio
link quality can be received with significantly higher reliability than
at Q~out~ and shall correspond to the in-sync block error rate
(BLER~in~) as defined in Table 10.3.1-1. For SSB based radio link
monitoring, Q~in\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 10.3.1.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based
radio link monitoring, Q~in\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 10.3.1.3.1-2.

The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER~out~) and in-sync block error
rate (BLER~in~) are determined from the network configuration via
parameter *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* signalled by higher layers. When
NCR-MT is not configured with *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold* from the
network, NCR-MT determines out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates
from Configuration \#0 in Table 10.3.1-1 by default. All requirements in
clause 10.3.1 are applicable for BLER Configuration \#0 in Table
10.3.1-1.

Table 10.3.1-1: Out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates

  Configuration   BLER~out~   BLER~in~
  --------------- ----------- ----------
  0               10%         2%

NCR-MT shall be able to monitor up to N~RLM~ RLM-RS resources of the
same or different types in each corresponding carrier frequency range,
depending on a maximum number of SSBs per half frame according to TS
38.213 \[24\], where N~RLM~ is specified in Table 10.3.1-2 according TS
38.213 \[24\], and meet the requirements as specified in clause 10.3.1.
NCR-MT is not required to meet the requirements in clause 10.3.1 if
RLM-RS is not configured and no TCI state for PDCCH is activated.

#### 10.3.1.2 Requirements for SSB based radio link monitoring

##### 10.3.1.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB based RLM-RS resource
configured for PCell, provided that the SSB configured for RLM is
actually transmitted within NCR-MT active DL BWP during the entire
evaluation period specified in clause 10.3.1.2.2.

##### 10.3.1.2.2 Minimum requirement

NCR-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality
on the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ \[ms\] period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

NCR-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality
on the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ \[ms\] period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in Table
10.3.1.2.2-1 for FR1 with scaling factor K~1~ = 5.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in Table
10.3.1.2.2-2 for FR2-1 with scaling factor N=8 and K~2~ = 3.

For FR1,

\- P = 1

For FR2-1,

> \- P=1, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the RLM-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = 3, when RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC period
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[23\] signaling of smtc~2~ is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtc~2~; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follow smtc~1~.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource and SMTC occasion configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

##### 10.3.1.2.3 Measurement restrictions for SSB based RLM

The NCR-MT is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The NCR-MT is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for
RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, NCR-MT shall be able to measure the
SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If NCR-MT supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, NCR-MT
shall be able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;

\- If NCR-MT does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*,
NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not both SSB for RLM and
CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based RLM is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR2-1, when the SSB for RLM measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, NCR-MT is required to measure
one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period
for SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 10.3.1.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring

##### 10.3.1.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS based RLM-RS
resource configured for PCell, provided that the CSI-RS configured for
RLM is actually transmitted within NCR-MT active DL BWP during the
entire evaluation period specified in clause 10.3.1.3.2. NCR-MT is not
expected to perform radio link monitoring measurements on the CSI-RS
configured as RLM-RS if the CSI-RS is not in the active TCI state of any
CORESET configured in the NCR-MT active BWP.

##### 10.3.1.3.2 Minimum requirement

NCR-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality
on the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ \[ms\] period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

NCR-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality
on the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ \[ms\] period becomes better than the threshold
Q~in\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
Table 10.3.1.3.2-1 for FR1 with scaling factor K~1~ = 5.

\- T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~ are defined in
Table 10.3.1.3.2-2 for FR2-1 with scaling factor K~2~ = 3.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_out\_CSI-RS~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_CSI-RS~
apply provided that the CSI-RS for RLM is not in a resource set
configured with repetition ON. The requirements do not apply when the
CSI-RS resource in the active TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS
resource for RLM and the TCI state information of the CSI-RS resource is
not given, wherein the TCI state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for
L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with repetition ON.

For FR1,

\- P=1 .

For FR2-1,

> (T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).
>
> \- P = 3, when the RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC
> occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[23\] signaling of smtc~2~ is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtc~2~; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follow smtc~1~.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for RLM and SMTC means that CSI-RS
based RLM is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource and SMTC occasion configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

The values of M~out~ and M~in~ used in Table 10.3.1.3.2-1 and Table
10.3.1.3.2-2 are defined as:

is transmitted with higher layer CSI-RS parameter *density* \[8, clause
7.4.1\] set to 3 and over the bandwidth ≥ 24 PRBs.

##### 10.3.1.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS based RLM

The NCR-MT is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for RLM without
measurement gaps. The NCR-MT is required to perform the CSI-RS
measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the following
clauses.

For both FR1 and FR2-1, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM
symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, NCR-MT is not
required to receive CSI-RS for RLM in the PRBs that overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD, or L1-RSRP measurement is
within the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the NCR-MT
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for RLM, the NCR-MT
shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions according
to its capabilities:

\- If the NCR-MT supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the
NCR-MT shall be able to perform CSI-RS for RLM measurement without
restrictions.

\- If the NCR-MT does not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, NCR-MT is required to measure
one of but not both CSI-RS for RLM and SSB. Longer measurement period
for CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as another
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, NCR-MT shall be able to
measure the CSI-RS for RLM without any restriction.

For FR2-1, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC
or different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
failure is detected, NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not both
CSI-RS for RLM and SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based RLM
is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2-1, when the CSI-RS for RLM measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC or different CCs in the same band,

\- In the following cases, NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not
both CSI-RS for RLM and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
CSI-RS based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for RLM or the other CSI-RS in a resource set configured
with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in q1 and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to NCR-MT,

\- Otherwise, NCR-MT shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for RLM without
any restriction.

#### 10.3.1.4 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT turning off the transmitter

The transmitter power of the NCR-MT in the monitored cell shall be
turned off within 40ms after expiry of T310 timer as specified in TS
38.331 \[23\].

#### 10.3.1.5 Minimum requirement for L1 indication

When the downlink radio link quality on all the configured RLM-RS
resources is worse than Q~out,\ layer\ 1~ of the NCR-MT shall send an
out-of-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the out-of-sync indications as specified in
TS 38.331 \[23\].

When the downlink radio link quality on at least one of the configured
RLM-RS resources is better than Q~in,\ layer\ 1~ of the NCR-MT shall
send an in-sync indication for the cell to the higher layers. A layer 3
filter shall be applied to the in-sync indications as specified in
TS 38.331 \[23\].

The out-of-sync and in-sync evaluations for the configured RLM-RS
resources shall be performed as specified in clause 5 \[25\]. Two
successive indications from layer 1 shall be separated by at least
T~Indication\_interval~.

T~Indication\_interval~ is max(10ms, T~RLM-RS,M~), where T~RLM,M~ is the
shortest periodicity of all configured RLM-RS resources for the
monitored cell, which corresponds to T~SSB~ specified in clause 10.3.1.2
if the RLM-RS resource is SSB, or T~CSI-RS~ specified in clause 10.3.1.3
if the RLM-RS resource is CSI-RS.

#### 10.3.1.6 Scheduling availability of NCR-MT during radio link monitoring

When the reference signal to be measured for RLM has different
subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH or is on frequency range 2, there
are restrictions on the scheduling availability as described in the
following clauses.

##### 10.3.1.6.1 Scheduling availability of NCR-MT performing radio link monitoring with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
performed with a same subcarrier spacing as PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1.

##### 10.3.1.6.2 Scheduling availability of NCR-MT performing radio link monitoring with a different subcarrier spacing than PDSCH/PDCCH on FR1

For NCR-MTs which support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[27\]
there are no restrictions on scheduling availability due to radio link
monitoring based on SSB as RLM-RS. For NCR-MTs which do not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* \[27\] the following restrictions
apply due to radio link monitoring based on SSB as RLM -RS.

> \- The NCR-MT is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or
> receive PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on SSB
> symbols to be measured for radio link monitoring.

##### 10.3.1.6.3 Scheduling availability of NCR-MT performing radio link monitoring on FR2-1

The following scheduling restriction applies due to radio link
monitoring on an FR2-1 serving PCell .

> \- If the RLM-RS is CSI-RS which is type-D QCLed with active TCI state
> for PDCCH or PDSCH, and the CSI-RS is not in a CSI-RS resource set
> with repetition ON,
>
> \- There are no scheduling restrictions due to radio link monitoring
> based on the CSI-RS.
>
> \- Otherwise
>
> \- The NCR-MT is not expected to transmit PUCCH, PUSCH or SRS or
> receive PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS for tracking or CSI-RS for CQI on
> RLM-RS symbols to be measured for radio link monitoring.

For FR2-1, if following conditions are met,

\- NCR-MT has been notified about system information update through
paging,

\- The gap between NCR-MT's reception of PDCCH that NCR-MT monitors in
the Type2-PDCCH CSS set and that notifies system information update, and
the PDCCH that NCR-MT monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, is greater
than 2 slots,

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 3, NCR-MT is expected to receive the PDCCH that NCR-MT monitors
in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and the corresponding PDSCH, on SSB symbols
to be measured for RLM; and

For the SSB for RLM and CORESET for RMSI scheduling multiplexing
patterns 2, NCR-MT is expected to receive PDSCH that corresponds to the
PDCCH that NCR-MT monitors in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set, on SSB symbols to
be measured for RLM.

### 10.3.2 Link Recovery Procedure

#### 10.3.2.1 Introduction

The local area NCR-MT as defined in clause 4.3A.2 shall assess the
downlink radio link quality of a serving cell based on the reference
signal in the set as specified in TS 38.213 \[24\] in order to detect
beam failure on:

\- PCell in SA NR,

The RS resource configurations in the set *on PCell* can be periodic
CSI-RS resources and/or SSBs. RS resource configuration in the set on
SCell shall be periodic CSI-RS. NCR-MT is not required to perform beam
failure detection outside the active DL BWP. NCR-MT is not required to
meet the requirements in clause 10.3.2.2 and 10.3.2.3 if NCR-MT does not
have set .

On each RS resource configuration in the set , the NCR-MT shall estimate
the radio link quality and compare it to the threshold Q~out\_LR~ for
the purpose of accessing downlink radio link quality of the serving cell
beams.

The threshold Q~out\_LR~ is defined as the level at which the downlink
radio level link of a given resource configuration on set cannot be
reliably received and shall correspond to the BLER~out~ = 10% block
error rate of a hypothetical PDCCH transmission. For SSB based beam
failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ is derived based on the hypothetical
PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 10.3.2.2.1. For CSI-RS
based beam failure detection, Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ is derived based on the
hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table 10.3.2.3.1-1.

Upon request the NCR-MT shall deliver configuration indexes from the set
*as specified in TS 38.213 \[24\] , to higher layers,* and the
corresponding L1-RSRP measurement provided that the measured L1-RSRP is
equal to or better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~, which is indicated by
higher layer parameter *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*. The NCR-MT applies the
Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from an SSB. The
NCR-MT applies the Q~in\_LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement
obtained for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS
reception power with a value provided by higher layer parameter
*powerControlOffsetSS*. The RS resource configurations in the set can be
periodic CSI-RS resources or SSBs or both SSB and CSI-RS resources.
NCR-MT is not required to perform candidate beam detection outside the
active DL BWP.

#### 10.3.2.2 Requirements for SSB based beam failure detection

##### 10.3.2.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
configured for a serving cell, provided that the SSB configured for beam
failure detection is actually transmitted within the NCR-MT active DL
BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 10.3.2.2.2.
The requirements in this clause could not be applicable if NCR-MT is
required to perform beam failure detection on more than 1 serving cell
per band.

##### 10.3.2.2.2 Minimum requirement

NCR-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality
on the configured SSB resource in set estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ ms period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ ms period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 10.3.2.2.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 10.3.2.2.2-2 for
FR2-1 with scaling factor N= 8.

For FR1,

\- P=1.

For FR2-1,

> \- P=1, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = 3, when the BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC period
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[23\] signaling of smtc~2~ is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtc~2~; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follow smtc~1~.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of BFD-RS
resource and SMTC occasion does not meet pervious conditions.

##### 10.3.2.2.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based beam failure detection

The NCR-MT is required to be capable of measuring SSB for BFD without
measurement gaps. The NCR-MT is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following scenarios.

For FR1, when the SSB for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, NCR-MT shall be able to measure the
SSB for BFD measurement without any restriction;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,

\- If NCR-MT supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, NCR-MT
shall be able to measure the SSB for BFD measurement without any
restriction;

\- If NCR-MT does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*,
NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not both SSB for BFD
measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based BFD
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2-1, when the SSB for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC in the same band, NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not
both SSB for BFD measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
SSB based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 10.3.2.3 Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection

##### 10.3.2.3.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set ![](./media/image23.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.21666666666666667in"} of resource configurations for a serving
cell, provided that the CSI-RS resource(s) in set
![](./media/image23.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.21666666666666667in"}for beam failure detection are actually
transmitted within the NCR-MT active DL BWP during the entire evaluation
period specified in clause 10.3.2.3.2. NCR-MT is not expected to perform
beam failure detection measurements on the CSI-RS configured for BFD if
the CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD when applicable, with the RS in
the active TCI state of any CORESET configured in the NCR-MT active BWP.
The requirements in this clause apply when NCR-MT is required to perform
beam failure detection on no more than 1 serving cell per band.

##### 10.3.2.3.2 Minimum requirement

NCR-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality
on the CSI-RS resource in set estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ ms period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_LR\_CSI-RS~ within T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ ms period.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table 10.3.2.3.2-1
for FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ is defined in Table 10.3.2.3.2-2
for FR2-1 with N=1.

The requirements of T~Evaluate\_BFD\_CSI-RS~ apply provided that the
CSI-RS for BFD is not in a resource set configured with repetition ON.
The requirements shall not apply when the CSI-RS resource in the active
TCI state of CORESET is the same CSI-RS resource for BFD and the TCI
state information of the CSI-RS resource is not given, wherein the TCI
state information means QCL Type-D to SSB for L1-RSRP or CSI-RS with
repetition ON.

For FR1,

\- P = 1.

For FR2-1,

\- P = 1, when the BFD-RS resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{CSI - RS}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$, when
the BFD-RS resource is partially overlapped with SMTC occasion
(T~CSI-RS~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = P~sharing\ factor~, when BFD-RS resource is fully overlapped with
SMTC occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P~sharing\ factor~ = 3**.**

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[23\] signaling of smtc~2~ is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtc~2~; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follow smtc~1~.

NOTE: The overlap between CSI-RS for BFD and SMTC means that CSI-RS for
BFD is within the SMTC window duration.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the
BFD-RS resource and SMTC occasion configurations does not meet pervious
conditions.

The values of M~BFD~ used in Table 10.3.2.3.2-1 and Table 10.3.2.3.2-2
are defined as

\- M~BFD~ = 10, if the CSI-RS resource(s) in set

##### 10.3.2.3.3 Measurement restrictions for CSI-RS based beam failure detection

The NCR-MT is required to be capable of measuring CSI-RS for BFD without
measurement gaps. The NCR-MT is required to perform the CSI-RS
measurements with measurement restrictions as described in the following
scenarios.

For both FR1 and FR2-1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the
same OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, NCR-MT
is not required to receive CSI-RS for BFD measurement in the PRBs that
overlap with an SSB.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has same SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement, the
NCR-MT shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

For FR1, when the SSB for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement is within
the active BWP and has different SCS than CSI-RS for BFD measurement,
the NCR-MT shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement with restrictions
according to its capabilities:

\- If the NCR-MT supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology* the
NCR-MT shall be able to perform CSI-RS measurement without restrictions.

\- If the NCR-MT does not support
*simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, NCR-MT is required to measure
one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement and SSB. Longer
measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is expected, and no
requirements are defined.

For FR1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol
as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement, NCR-MT shall
be able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD measurement without any
restriction.

For FR2-1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC in
the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD measurement on the
same CC in the same band when beam failure is detected, NCR-MT is
required to measure one of but not both CSI-RS for BFD measurement and
SSB. Longer measurement period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is
expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2-1, when the CSI-RS for BFD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as another CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement
on the same CC in the same band,

\- In the following cases, NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not
both CSI-RS for BFD measurement and the other CSI-RS. Longer measurement
period for CSI-RS based BFD measurement is expected, and no requirements
are defined.

\- The CSI-RS for BFD measurement or the other CSI-RS in a resource set
configured with repetition ON, or

\- The other CSI-RS is configured in set
![](./media/image24.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} and beam failure is detected, or

\- The two CSI-RS-es are not QCL-ed w.r.t. QCL-TypeD, or the QCL
information is not known to NCR-MT,

\- Otherwise, NCR-MT shall be able to measure the CSI-RS for BFD
measurement without any restriction.

#### 10.3.2.4 Minimum requirement for L1 indication

When the radio link quality on all the RS resources in set is worse than
Q~out\_LR,\ layer\ 1~ of the NCR-MT shall send a beam failure instance
indication to the higher layers. A layer 3 filter may be applied to the
beam failure instance indications as specified in TS 38.331 \[23\].

The beam failure instance evaluation for the RS resources in set shall
be performed as specified in clause 6 in TS 38.213 \[24\]. Two
successive indications from layer 1 shall be separated by at least
T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~.

T~Indication\_interval\_BFD~ is max(2ms, T~SSB-RS,M~) ) or max(2ms,
T~CSI-RS,M~), where T~SSB-RS,M~ and T~CSI-RS,M~ is the shortest
periodicity of all RS resources in set for the accessed cell,
corresponding to either the shortest periodicity of the SSB in the set
or CSI-RS resource in the set .

#### 10.3.2.5 Requirements for SSB based candidate beam detection

##### 10.3.2.5.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause apply for each SSB resource in the set
![](./media/image24.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} configured for a serving cell, provided that the
SSBs configured for candidate beam detection are actually transmitted
within NCR-MT active DL BWP during the entire evaluation period
specified in clause 10.3.2.5.2.

##### 10.3.2.5.2 Minimum requirement

Upon request the NCR-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the L1-RSRP
measured on the configured SSB resource in set
![](./media/image24.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} estimated over the last T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ ms
period becomes better than the threshold Q~in\_LR~ provided SSB\_RP and
SSB Ês/Iot are according to Annex Table in B.2.4.1 \[23\] for a
corresponding band.

The NCR-MT shall monitor the configured SSB resources using the
evaluation period in table 10.3.2.5.2-1 and 10.3.2.5.2-2 which is
applicable to the non-DRX mode only.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 10.3.2.5.2-1 for
FR1.

The value of T~Evaluate\_CBD\_SSB~ is defined in Table 10.3.2.5.2-2 for
FR2-1 with scaling factor N=8.

Where,

For FR1,

\- P = 1.

For FR2-1,

> \- P=1, when the candidate beam detection RS resource is not
> overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,
when candidate beam detection RS is partially overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = 3, when candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with SMTC
period (T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

If the high layer in TS 38.331 \[23\] signaling of smtc~2~ is present,
T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtc~2~; Otherwise T~SMTCperiod~ follow smtc~1~.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of CBD-RS
resource and SMTC occasion configurations does not meet pervious
conditions.

##### 10.3.2.5.3 Measurement restriction for SSB based candidate beam detection

For FR1, when the SSB for CBD measurement is in the same OFDM symbol as
CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, NCR-MT shall be able to measure the
SSB for CBD measurement without any restrictions;

\- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS-es,

\- If NCR-MT supports *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*, NCR-MT
shall be able to measure the SSB for CBD measurement without any
restriction;

\- If NCR-MT does not support *simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology*,
NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not both SSB for CBD
measurement and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for SSB based CBD
measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

For FR2-1, when the SSB for CBD measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC in the same band, NCR-MT is required to measure one of but not

SSB based CBD measurement is expected, and no requirements are defined.

#### 10.3.2.6 Requirements for CSI-RS based candidate beam detection

##### 10.3.2.6.1 Introduction

set ![](./media/image24.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in"
height="0.21875in"} configured for a serving cell, provided that the
CSI-RS resources configured for candidate beam detection are actually

domain by

.

C.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

C.2.1 General
-------------

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

\- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2
(24.25 GHz -- 52.6 GHz).

C.2.2 Delay profiles
--------------------

### C.2.2.1 General

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[29\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in C.2.2.1 can be used as such.

\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[29\].

\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[29\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge
the taps as follows:

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered):

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise:

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables C.2.2.2-2, C.2.2.2-3, and
C.2.1.1-4 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### C.2.2.2 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in C.2.2.2-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables C.2.2.2-2 \~ table C.2.2.2-4.

multi-path fading environment are indicated as a combination of a
channel model name and a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e.,

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in table C.2.4.2.3-2, C.2.4.2.3-3 and C.2.4.2.3-4 as below.

The values in table C.2.4.2.3-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 high
correlation case to ensure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](./media/image39.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.28125in"}

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a = 0.00010.

low correlation.

### C.2.4.3 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

#### C.2.4.3.1 General

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex C.2.4.3 apply to
two cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both NCR-MT and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at NCR-MT.
For multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with
+90/0 degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at NCR-MT.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

C.3 Physical signals, channels mapping and precoding
====================================================

C.3.1 General
-------------

Unless otherwise stated, the transmission on antenna port(s)
$p = p_{0},\ p_{0} + 1,...,\ p_{0} + N_{p} - 1$ is defined by using a
precoder matrix of size $N_{\text{ANT}} \times N_{p}$, where
$N_{\text{ANT}}\ $is the number of physical transmit antenna elements
configured per test , $N_{p}$ is the number of ports for a reference
signal or physical channel configured per test, and $p_{0}$ is the first
port for that reference signal or physical channel as defined in clauses
7.3 and 7.4 in TS 38.211 \[21\]. This precoder takes as an input a block
of signals for antenna port(s)
$p = p_{0},p_{0} + 1,...,p_{0} + N_{p} - 1$,
$y^{\left( p \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y^{\left( p_{0} \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \ }y^{\left( p_{0} + 1 \right)}\left( i \right)\ \ldots\ \ \ y^{\left( p_{0} + N_{p} - 1 \right)}\left( i \right) \right\rbrack^{T}$,
, with being the number of modulation symbols per antenna port including
the reference signal symbols, and generates a block of signals
$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 0 \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \ }y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 1 \right)}\left( i \right)\ \ldots\ \ \ y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( N_{\text{ANT}} - 1 \right)}\left( i \right) \right\rbrack^{T}$
the elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index
pair as per the test configuration but transmitted on different physical
antenna elements:

$$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = W\left( i \right)y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$$

For Clause 8.2.3 and 9.4.1, the transmission of PDCCH and PDCCH DMRS on
antenna port $p = p_{0}$ is defined by using a precoder matrix of size
2x1. This precoder takes as an input a block of signals for antenna
port(s) $p = p_{0}$,
$y^{\left( p \right)}\left( i \right) = y^{\left( p_{0} \right)}\left( i \right)$
and generates a block of signals
$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 0 \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \ }y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( \frac{N_{\text{ANT}}}{2} \right)}\left( i \right) \right\rbrack^{T}$
the elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index
pair as per the test configuration but transmitted on different physical
antenna elements:

$$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = W\left( i \right)y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$$

The precoder matrix is specific to the test case configuration. is
defined in Clause 5.2.2.2 of TS 38.214 \[28\].

The transimison on PT-RS antenna port is associated (using same
precoder) with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS
antenna ports assigned for the PDSCH.

The physical antenna elements are identified by indices, where is the
number of physical antenna elements configured per test.

Modulation symbols $y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$ with
$p \in \left\{ 4000 \right\}$ (i.e. PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH)
are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.

*Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for tracking
with one port* are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.

*Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for beam
refinement with one port* are directly mapped to first physical antenna
element.

*Modulation symbols for NZP CSI-RS which configured for CSI acquisition
with* are *mapped to the physical antenna index* where is the number of
NZP CSI-RS ports configured per test.

G.1.2 OFDMA channel noise generator (OCNG)
------------------------------------------

### G.1.2.1 Generic OFDMA Channel Noise Generator (OCNG)

The OCNG pattern is used in a test for modelling allocations of unused
resources in the channel bandwidth to virtual NCR-MTs (which are not
under test). The OCNG pattern comprises PDCCH and PDSCH transmissions to
the virtual NCR-MTs.

G.1.3 Antenna configurations
----------------------------

### G.1.3.1 Antenna configurations for FR1

Unless otherwise specified, NR TDD cells in all RRM Test cases in AWGN
propagation condition are configured with **Antenna Configuration
\[1x2\]**.

#### G.1.3.1.1 Antenna connection for 4 Rx capable NCR-MT

##### G.1.3.1.1.1 Introduction

All tests for FR1 are specified for NCR-MTs supporting 2RX. In this
clause, the antenna connection method for applying 2RX tests to NCR-MTs
supporting 4RX antenna ports is specified. No tests are currently
specified for FR1 which are applicable only to 4RX antenna ports, so 4RX
capable NCR-MTs are always tested by reusing tests which were originally
specified for 2RX NCR-MTs.

##### G.1.3.1.1.2 Principle of testing

##### G.1.3.1.1.2.1 Single carrier tests {#g.1.3.1.1.2.1-single-carrier-tests .H6}

For 4RX capable NCR-MTs supporting at least one 2RX band, the, all
single carrier tests specified for FR1 except those in G.2.3 shall be
tested on any band where 2RX is supported with the antenna connection
specified in clause G.1.3.1.1.2.2.

For 4RX capable NCR-MT which do not support any 2RX band, all tests
specified for FR1 shall be tested using the antenna connection specified
in clause G.1.3.1.1.2.3. For radio link monitoring tests, the SNR levels
are modified according to table G.1.3.1.1.2.1-1 and table
G.1.3.1.1.2.1-2. For beam failure detection and link recovery tests, the
SNR levels are modified according to table G.1.3.1.1.2.1-3.

##### G.1.3.1.1.2.2 Antenna connection for bands where 2RX is supported {#g.1.3.1.1.2.2-antenna-connection-for-bands-where-2rx-is-supported .H6}

For bands where 2RX is supported, it is left to declaration and AP
configuration to decide which 2 of the 4 Rx ports are connected with
data source from tester. The remaining 2 Rx ports shall be connected
with zero input**.** No test parameters or requirements are modified.

##### G.1.3.1.1.2.3 Antenna connection for bands where 4RX is supported {#g.1.3.1.1.2.3-antenna-connection-for-bands-where-4rx-is-supported .H6}

For bands where 4RX is supported, all 4 RX antennas are connected with
data source from tester**.** The Tester provide independent noise and
fading (low correlation) for each antenna port. Except for the
modifications to radio link monitoring thresholds described in clauses
G.1.3.1.1.2.1 and G.1.3.1.1.2.2, no test parameters or requirements are
modified.

### G.1.3.2 Antenna configurations for FR2

Unless otherwise specified, the default Downlink **Antenna Configuration
for NR FR2 cells is 1x2.**

In case of Downlink **Antenna Configuration 2x2 for NR FR2 cells, unless
otherwise specified,** the downlink signal is transmitted over the two
polarizations (V and H) of the dual polarized antenna of the test
equipment.

G.1.4 BWP configurations
------------------------

### G.1.4.1 Introduction

This clause provides the typical BWP configurations used for RRM test
cases defined in Annex G. For downlink BWP, both initial BWP and
dedicated BWP configurations are specified in clause G.1.4.2 and for
uplink BWP, both initial BWP and dedicated BWP configurations are
specified in clause G.1.4.3.

G.1.8 Angle of Arrival (AoA) for FR2 RRM test cases
---------------------------------------------------

This clause specifies the AoA setups for FR2 RRM test cases. The
applicable AoA setup is defined in each test case.

### G.1.8.1 Setup 1: Single AoA

There is only one active probe in the test. The DL signals, and noise if
applicable, transmitted from the probe, are aligned to AoA based upon
the declaration.

### G.1.8.2 Setup 2: 2 AoAs

There are 2 active probes in the test. The DL signals, and noise if
applicable, transmitted from the two active probes, align to AoAs based
upon the declaration.

G.1.9 TCI State Configuration
-----------------------------

### G.1.9.1 Introduction

This clause provides the configurations for TCI states towards either
SSB or CSI-RS. The TCI states defined in this clause are configured in
each test when applicable to indicate that certain DL signals are QCL'ed
with the referenceSignal configured in the TCI states.

G.2 NCR-MT RRM test cases
=========================

G.2.1 RRC\_CONNECTED state mobility for NCR-MTs
-----------------------------------------------

### G.2.1.1 RRC Connection Mobility Control

#### G.2.1.1.2 RRC Re-establishment for LA NCR-MT

##### G.2.1.1.1.1 Inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR1 for LA NCR-MT

##### G.2.1.1.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR inter-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR1 to an unknown target cell is within the
specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in
clause 10.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT
and for NCR type 1-H.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.1.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.1.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.1.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, becomes inactive. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure. During T1, the NCR-MT shall be
configured with the carrier frequency of cell 2 (with RF Channel Number
\#2) to ensure that the NCR-MT has the context of the carrier frequency
of cell 2 by the end of T1.

##### G.2.1.1.1.1.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the NCR-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR inter frequency cell
shall be less than 14.5 s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
following expression:

$$T_{\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} + T_{\text{UL}\_\text{grant}}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = 400\ ms + T_{\text{identify}\_\text{intra}\_\text{NR}} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{\text{identify}\_\text{inter}\_\text{NR},i} + T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 2
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 6400 ms
>
> *T~identify\_inter\_NR~* = 6400 ms
>
> $T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}}$ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for
> receiving all the relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331
> for the target inter-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.
>
> This gives a total of 14495 ms, allow 14.5 s in the test case.

##### G.2.1.1.1.2 Intra-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR1 without serving cell timing for LA NCR-MT

##### G.2.1.1.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR intra-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR1 without serving cell timing is within the
specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in clause
10.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT and for
NCR type 1-H.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.2.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.2.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.2.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, is deactivated. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure.

##### G.2.1.1.1.2.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.2.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the NCR-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR intra frequency cell
without serving cell timing shall be less than 8.1 s.

> The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated
> tests shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
following expression:

$$T_{\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} + T_{\text{UL}\_\text{grant}}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = 400\ ms + T_{\text{identify}\_\text{intra}\_\text{NR}} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{\text{identify}\_\text{inter}\_\text{NR},i} + T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 1
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 6400 ms
>
> $T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}}$ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for
> receiving all the relevant system information as defined in
> TS 38.331 \[2\] for the target intra-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.
>
> This gives a total of 8095 ms, allow 8.1 s in the test case.

##### G.2.1.1.1.3 Inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR2-1 for LA NCR-MT

##### G.2.1.1.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.3.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR inter-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR2-1 without known target cell is within the
specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in
clause 10.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT
and for NCR type 2-O.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.3.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.3.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.3.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, becomes inactive. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure. During T1, the NCR-MT shall be
configured with the carrier frequency of cell 2 (with RF Channel Number
\#2) to ensure that the NCR-MT has the context of the carrier frequency
of cell 2 by the end of T1.

##### G.2.1.1.1.3.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.3.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the NCR-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR inter frequency cell
shall be less than 18 s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
following expression:

$$T_{\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} + T_{\text{UL}\_\text{grant}}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = 400\ ms + T_{\text{identify}\_\text{intra}\_\text{NR}} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{\text{identify}\_\text{inter}\_\text{NR},i} + T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 2
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 8000 ms
>
> *T~identify\_inter\_NR~* = 8000 ms
>
> $T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}}$ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for
> receiving all the relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331
> for the target inter-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.
>
> This gives a total of 17695 ms, allow 18 s in the test case.

##### G.2.1.1.1.4 Intra-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR2-1 without serving cell timing for LA NCR-MT

##### G.2.1.1.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.4.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR intra-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR2-1 without serving cell timing is within
the specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in
clause 10.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT
and for NCR type 2-O.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.4.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.4.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.4.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, is deactivated. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure.

##### G.2.1.1.1.4.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.4.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the NCR-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR intra frequency cell
without serving cell timing shall be less than 30 s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
following expression:

$$T_{\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} + T_{\text{UL}\_\text{grant}}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{\text{NCR} - \text{MT}\_\text{re} - \text{establish}\_\text{delay}} = 400\ ms + T_{\text{identify}\_\text{intra}\_\text{NR}} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{\text{identify}\_\text{inter}\_\text{NR},i} + T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 1
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 28160 ms
>
> $T_{\text{SI} - \text{NR}}$ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for
> receiving all the relevant system information as defined in
> TS 38.331 \[2\] for the target intra-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.

This gives a total of 29855 ms, allow 30 s in the test case.

### G.2.2.1 Transmit timing

#### G.2.2.1.1 NR NCR-MT Transmit Timing Test for FR1

##### G.2.2.1.1.1 Test Purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT can follow frame
timing change of the connected gNodeb and that the NCR-MT initial
transmit timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in one
adjustment, minimum and maximum adjustment rate are within the specified
limits. This test will verify the requirements in clause 10.2.1.2. Local
area NCR-MT type 1-C and type 1-H shall be tested with this test.

Supported test configurations are shown in Table G.2.2.1.1.1-1.

Table G.2.2.1.1.1-1: Supported test configurations for FR1 PCell

  Configuration                                                                                Description

  Note: The NCR-MT is only required to be tested in one of the supported test configurations   

For this test a single NR cell (Cell 1) is used. Table G.2.2.1.1.1-2
defines the parameters to be configured and strength of the transmitted
signals. The transmit timing is verified by the NCR-MT transmitting SRS
using the configuration defined in Table G.2.2.1.1.1-3.

##### G.2.2.1.1.2 Test requirements

The test sequence shall be carried out in RRC\_CONNECTED for every test
case.

Following will be the test sequence for this test

1\) Setup NR PCell according to parameters given in Table G.2.2.1.1.1-1.

2\) After connection set up with the cell, the test equipment will
verify that the timing of the NR cell is within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~)
×T~c~ ± T~e~ of the first path (in time) of DL SSB used by the NCR-MT to
determine downlink timing is received from the reference cell at the
NCR-MT antenna.

a\. The N~TA~ offset value (in T~c~ units) is 25600

b\. The T~e~ values depend on the DL and UL SCS for which the test is
being run and are given in Table 10.2.1.2-1

3\) The test system shall adjust the timing of the DL path by values
given in Table G.2.2.1.1.2-1

Table G.2.2.1.1.2-1: Adjustment Value for DL Timing

  SCS of SSB signals (KHz)   Adjustment Value

  30                         +32\*64T~c~

4\) The test system shall verify that the adjustment step size and the
adjustment rate shall be according to requirements specified in clause
10.2.1.2 Table 10.2.1.2.1-1 until the NCR-MT transmit timing offset is
within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~) ×T~c~ ± T~e~ respective to the first path
(in time) of DL SSB used by the NCR-MT to determine downlink timing is
received from the reference cell at the NCR-MT antenna.

5\) The test system shall verify that the NCR-MT transmit timing offset
stays within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~) ×T~c~ ± T~e~ of the first path (in
time) of DL SSB used by the NCR-MT to determine downlink timing is
received from the reference cell at the NCR-MT antenna.

#### G.2.2.1.2 NR NCR-MT Transmit Timing Test for FR2-1

##### G.2.2.1.2.1 Test Purpose and environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT can follow frame
timing change of the connected gNodeb and that the NCR-MT initial
transmit timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in one
adjustment, minimum and maximum adjustment rate are within the specified
limits. This test will verify the requirements in clause 10.2.1.2. Local
area NCR-MT type 2-O shall be tested with this test.

Supported test configurations are shown in Table G.2.2.1.2.1-1.

Table G.2.2.1.2.1-1: Supported test configurations for FR2-1 PCell

  Configuration   Description
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  1               NR TDD, SSB SCS 240 kHz, data SCS 120 kHz, BW 100 MHz

For this test a single NR cell is used. Tables G.2.2.1.2.1-2 and Tables
G.2.2.1.2.1-2A define the parameters to be configured and strength of
the transmitted signals. The transmit timing is verified by the NCR-MT
transmitting SRS using the configuration defined in Table G.2.2.1.2.1-3.

##### G.2.2.1.2.2 Test requirements

The test sequence shall be carried out in RRC\_CONNECTED for every test
case.

Following will be the test sequence for this test:

1\) Setup NR PCell according to parameters given in Table G.2.2.1.2.1-1.

2\) After connection set up with the cell, the test equipment will
verify that the timing of the NR cell is within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~)
×T~c~ ± T~e~ of the first path (in time) of DL SSB used by the NCR-MT to
determine downlink timing is received from the reference cell at the
NCR-MT antenna.

a\. The N~TA~ offset value (in T~c~ units) is 13792

b\. The T~e~ values depend on the DL and UL SCS for which the test is
being run and are given in Table 10.2.1.2-1

3\) The test system shall adjust the timing of the DL path by values
given in Table G.2.2.1.2.2-1

Table G.2.2.1.2.2-1: Adjustment Value for DL Timing

  SCS of SSB signals (kHz)   Adjustment Value   
  -------------------------- ------------------ ------------
                             Test1              Test2
  240                        +8\*64T~c~         +4\*64T~c~

4\) The test system shall verify that the adjustment step size and the
adjustment rate shall be according to requirements specified in clause
10.2.1.2 Table 10.2.1.2.1-1 until the NCR-MT transmit timing offset is
within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~) ×T~c~ ± T~e~ respective to the first path
(in time) of DL SSB used by the NCR-MT to determine downlink timing is
received from the reference cell at the NCR-MT antenna.

5\) The test system shall verify that the NCR-MT transmit timing offset
stays within (N~TA~ + N~TA\_offset~) ×T~c~ ± T~e~ of the first path (in
time) of DL SSB used by the NCR-MT to determine downlink timing is
received from the reference cell at the NCR-MT antenna.

### G.2.3.1 Radio link Monitoring

#### G.2.3.1.1 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, NCR-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.1.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.1-2 and G.2.3.1.1.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell 1),
which is the active NR cell, in the test. The test consists of three
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.1.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior
to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully
synchronized to Cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5 ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.1.1-1: SNR variation for out-of-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.1.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3
shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The NCR-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (D1 second after the start of the time duration T3).

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.1.2 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, NCR-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.2.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.2.1-2, and G.2.3.1.2.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell
1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test consists of five
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.2.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior
to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully
synchronized to Cell 1. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the
NCR-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be
configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5
ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.2.1-1: SNR variation for in-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.2.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.1.3 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR2-1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2-1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, NCR-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.3.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.3.1-2 and G.2.3.1.3.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell
1), which is the active NR cell, in the test. The test consists of three
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states, and
Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-2 shows the Time multiplexed downlink transmissions
from each Angle of Arrival. Prior to the start of the time duration T1,
the NCR-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be
configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5
ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-1: SNR variation for out-of-sync testing

Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-2: Time multiplexed downlink transmissions

##### G.2.3.1.3.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behavior in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3
shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The NCR-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (D1 second after the start of the time duration T3).

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.1.4 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR2-1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2-1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, NCR-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.4.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.4.1-2, and G.2.3.1.4.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell
1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test consists of five
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states, and
Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-2 shows the Time multiplexed downlink transmissions
from each Angle of Arrival. Prior to the start of the time duration T1,
the NCR-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. Prior to the start of
the time duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1.
The NCR-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a
reporting periodicity of 5 ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-1: SNR variation for in-sync testing

Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-2: Time multiplexed downlink transmissions

##### G.2.3.1.4.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.1.5 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the out of sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based
radio link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1
PCell CSI-RS Out-of-sync radio link monitoring requirements in
clause 12.3.1.3. This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT
and for NCR type 1-H.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.5.1-1, G.2.3.1.5.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.5.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the PCell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.5.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate out-of-sync and
in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT
shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be configured
for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity defined in
CSI-RS configuration. In the test, SSB0 is configured as the BFD-RS.

##### G.2.3.1.5.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, and T3 shall be as
follows:

During time durations T1, T2 and T3, the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 at least in all uplink slots configured
for CSI transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting
for Cell 1.

The NCR-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal in Cell 1 no later than
time point C (D~1~ ms after the start of the time duration T3) on the
PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.1.6 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 PCell
CSI-RS In-sync radio link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.3.
This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT and for NCR type
1-H.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.6.1-1, G.2.3.1.6.1-2,
and G.2.3.1.6.1-3 below. There is one cells, cell 1which is the PCell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.1.6.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to
emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time
duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The
NCR-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting
periodicity defined in CSI-RS configuration. In the test, SSB0 is
configured as the BFD-RS.

Figure G.2.3.1.6.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS in-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.6.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (T6 second after the
start of time duration T5) the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting on the PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.1.7 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR2-1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.7.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the out of sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based
radio link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2-1
PCell CSI-RS Out-of-sync radio link monitoring requirements in
clause 12.3.1.3. This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT
and for NCR type 2-0.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.7.1-1, G.2.3.1.7.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.7.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the PCell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.7.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate out-of-sync and
in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT
shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be configured
for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 10 ms. In the
test, SSB0 and SSB1 are configured as BFD-RS.

Figure G.2.3.1.7.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS out-of-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.7.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, and T3 shall be as
follows:

During time durations T1, T2 and T3, the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 at least in all uplink slots configured
for CSI transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting
for Cell 1.

The NCR-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal in Cell 1 no later than
time point C (D~1~ second after the start of the time duration T3) on
the PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.1.8 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR2-1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
the in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2 PCell
CSI-RS In-sync radio link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.3.
This test case is applicable only for local area NCR-MT and for NCR type
2-O.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.8.1-1, G.2.3.1.8.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.8.1-3 below. There is one cells, cell 1which is the PCell, in
the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.8.1-1
shows the variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate
out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration
T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The NCR-MT shall
be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of
10 ms. In the test, SSB0 and SSB1 are configured as BFD-RS.

Figure G.2.3.1.8.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS in-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.8.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting on the PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### G.2.3.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Procedure

#### G.2.3.2.1 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based BFD and LR

##### G.2.3.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
SSB-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and
that the NCR-MT performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam
candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for
beam failure detection within the NCR-MTs active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery. This test will partly verify the
SSB based beam failure detection and link recovery for an FR1 serving
cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.1.1-1, G.2.3.2.1.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.1.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.1.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the SSB in set
q~0~ in the active cell to emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.1.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. The NCR-MT is configured
to perform inter-frequency measurements using GP ID \#0 (40ms) in test
1.

Figure G.2.3.2.1.1-1: SNR and L1-RSRP variation SSB for SSB-based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing

##### G.2.3.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the NCR-MT shall detect beam failure and initiate link
recovery. During T4 and T5 the NCR-MT measures and evaluate beam
candidate from beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 120+10 ms after
the start of T5, the NCR-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The NCR-MT shall not transmit preamble
on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the NCR-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

#### G.2.3.2.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR2 PCell configured with SSB-based BFD and LR

##### G.2.3.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
SSB-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and
that the NCR-MT performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam
candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for
beam failure detection within the NCR-MT active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test
will partly verify the SSB based beam failure detection and link
recovery for an FR2 serving cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.2.1-1, G.2.3.2.2.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.2.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.2.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the SSB in set
q~0~ in the active cell to emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.2.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX
configuration is not enabled.

Figure G.2.3.2.2.1-1: SNR and L1-RSRP variation SSB for SSB-based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the NCR-MT shall detect beam failure and initiate link
recovery. During T4 and T5 the NCR-MT measures and evaluate beam
candidate from beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 560+650 ms after
the start of T5, the NCR-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The NCR-MT shall not transmit preamble
on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the NCR-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

#### G.2.3.2.3 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based BFD and LR

##### G.2.3.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
CSI-RS-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell
and that the NCR-MT performs correct CSI-RS-based link recovery based on
beam candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring
for beam failure detection within the NCR-MTs active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery. This test will partly verify the
CSI-RS based beam failure detection and link recovery for an FR1 serving
cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.3.1-1, G.2.3.2.3.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.3.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.3.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the CSI-RS in
set q~0~ in the active cell to emulate CSI-RS based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.3.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the CSI-RS in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms.

Figure G.2.3.2.3.1-1: SNR and L1-RSRP variation for CSI-RS-based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing

##### G.2.3.2.3.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the shall detect beam failure and initial link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the NCR-MT measures and evaluate beam candidate from
beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 30+10 ms after
the start of T5, the NCR-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The NCR-MT shall not transmit preamble
on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the NCR-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

#### G.2.3.2.4 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR2 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based BFD and LR in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.2.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the NCR-MT properly detects
CSI-RS-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell
and that the NCR-MT performs correct CSI-RS-based link recovery based on
beam candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring
for beam failure detection within the NCR-MT's active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test
will partly verify the CSI-RS based beam failure detection and link
recovery for an FR2 serving cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.4.1-1, G.2.3.2.4.1-2,
and G.2.3.2.4.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active
cell, in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods,
with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.4.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the CSI-RS in
set q~0~ in the active cell to emulate CSI-RS based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.4.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the CSI-RS in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the NCR-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The NCR-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX
configuration is not enabled.

Figure G.2.3.2.4.1-1: SNR and L1-RSRP variation for CSI-RS based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.2.4.2 Test Requirements

The NCR-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the NCR-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the NCR-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the shall detect beam failure and initial link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the NCR-MT measures and evaluate beam candidate from
beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = \[560+650 ms\]
after the start of T5, the NCR-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam
associated with the candidate beam set q~1~. The NCR-MT shall not
transmit preamble on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~
earlier than time point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the NCR-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.
