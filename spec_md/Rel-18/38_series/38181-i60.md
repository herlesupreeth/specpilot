conformance testing may not be justified for some products due to too
large SAN GEO antenna array dimensions, and required OTA RF chamber
size.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

The radiated requirements are classified according to spatial
characteristics as shown in table 4.1.1-1 and table 4.1.1-2.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Conducted Test System and OTA
Test System are specified below for each test defined explicitly in the
present specification, where appropriate. The maximum acceptable
uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements included by
reference is defined in the respective referred test specification.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For conducted RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in
clause 4.1.2 apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm
load and do not include system effects due to mismatch between the EUT
and the Test System.

For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, measurement
methodology description (including calibration and measurement stage for
each test range), MU budget format and its contributions, refer to
TR 37.941 \[13\], where MU analyses for the BS radiated testing were
captured. The maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for FR1-NTN and
FR2-NTN OTA transmitter and receiver tests were reused from BS MU
budgets in TR 37.941 \[13\]. Reuse of TR 37.941 \[13\] MU values for SAN
LEO radiated conformance testing is subject to the following conditions:

\- EUT suitability to fit OTA chambers considered in TR 37.941 \[13\],
and

\- Environmental test conditions assumed for BS testing in TR 37.941
\[13\].

Reuse of TR 37.941 \[13\] TT~OTA~ values for SAN GEO radiated
conformance testing may not be justified for some products due to too
large SAN GEO antenna array dimensions, and required OTA RF chamber
size.

#### 4.1.2.2 Measurement of transmitter

The maximum conducted Test System uncertainty for conducted transmitter
tests minimum requirements is given in table 4.1.2.2-1. The maximum OTA
Test System uncertainty for OTA transmitter tests minimum requirements
is given in table 4.1.2.2-2 for FR1-NTN and in table 4.1.2.2-3 for
FR2-NTN.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545
\[3\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this
may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure
that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1.2 had
been used.

4.2 Requirement reference points
--------------------------------

### 4.2.1 SAN type 1-H

For *SAN type 1-H*, the requirements are defined for two points of
reference, signified by radiated requirements and conducted
requirements.

![C:\\Users\\sunsang\\Pictures\\Saved Pictures\\san
diagram.png](./media/image4.png){width="6.420833333333333in"
height="3.38125in"}

Figure 4.2.1-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *SAN type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
radiated interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary*
(RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements.
The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality receiving and transmitting modulated signal to ensure
radio links with users.

The satellite payload is composed by a transceiver unit array and a
composite antenna array. The transceiver unit array contains an
implementation specific number of transmitter units and an
implementation specific number of receiver units.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

### 4.2.2 *SAN type 1-O*, *SAN type 2-O*

For *SAN type 1-O and SAN type 2-O*, the radiated characteristics are
defined over the air (OTA), where the *operating band* specific radiated
interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB).
Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The
(spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

height="3.38125in"}

Figure 4.2.2-1: Radiated reference points for *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN
type 2-O*

Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into transceiver
units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

4.3 Satellite Access Node classes
---------------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Satellite Access Node
unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios are exactly
the same for SAN with and without connectors.

SAN classes are defined in Table 4.3-1.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

### 4.7.3 NRTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of test configuration NRTC1 is to test all SAN requirements
excluding CA occupied bandwidth.

For NRTC1 used in receiver tests only the two outermost carriers within
each supported operating band need to be generated by the test
equipment;

#### 4.7.3.1 NRTC1 generation

NRTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum *SAN RF Bandwidth* supported for contiguous spectrum
operation (D.16) shall be used;

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower SAN RF Bandwidth edge. Place same signal adjacent
to the upper SAN RF Bandwidth edge.

\- If NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band is supported, place the power
boosted NB-IoT RB at the lower outermost RB at the lower SAN RF
Bandwidth edge eligible for NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band according
to clause 5.7.3 of TS 36.108 \[22\] and the definition in clause 3.1. If
more than one NB-IoT carrier is supported with NB-IoT operation in NTN
NR in-band, place the power boosted NB-IoT RB at the upper outermost RB
at the upper SAN RF Bandwidth edge eligible for NB-IoT operation in NTN
NR in-band.

\- For transmitter tests, select as many carriers (according to 4.7.2)
that the SAN supports within an *operating band* and fit in the rest of
the declared maximum *SAN RF Bandwidth* (D.16). Place the carriers
adjacent to each other starting from the upper *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge.
The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

All configured component carriers are transmitted simultaneously in the
tests where the transmitter should be ON.

#### 4.7.3.2 NRTC1 power allocation

For conducted test:

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,TABC~, D.35) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration in
clause 4.6.

For OTA test:

Set the number of carriers to the number of carriers at maximum TRP
(D.15).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,t,TRP~ (D.33).

### 4.8.3 Applicability of test configurations for single-band operation

The applicable test configurations are specified in the tables below for
each the supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according
to clause 4.6. The generation and power allocation for each test
configuration is defined in clause 4.7. This clause contains the test
configurations for a SAN capable of single carrier, multi-carrier
operation in contiguous spectrum in single band.

For a SAN declared to be capable of single carrier operation only
(D.39), a single carrier (SC) shall be used for testing.

For conducted test, for a SAN declared to support multi-carrier
operation in contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.39) with
*single band connector*, the test configurations in the second column of
table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for testing.

For OTA test, for a SAN declared to support multi-carrier operation in
contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.39) with *single band RIB*,
the test configurations in the second column of table 4.8.3-2 shall be
used for testing.

Unless otherwise stated, single carrier configuration (SC) tests shall
be performed using signal with narrowest supported channel bandwidth and
the smallest supported sub-carrier spacing.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single carrier testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the SAN. These are denoted as RF channels B
(bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum SAN RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range
in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~
(middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum SAN RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum SAN RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum SAN RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may
consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

##### 4.9.2.2.7 NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band test model (NR-N-TM)

The NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band test shall be performed by
puncturing one NR RB at the eligible (according to clause 5.7.3 of
TS 36.108 \[22\] and the definition in clause 3.1) in-band position
closest to NR minimum guard band.

The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according
to the FR1 test model 1.1 (NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.1) on all NR carriers and the
NB-IoT Test Model (N-TM) defined in TS 36.181 \[23\] on all NB-IoT
carriers.

The power for NR RE and NB-IoT RE is set by following procedures:

\- The average power per RE over all RBs (both NR and NB-IoT) is
calculated according to manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier output
power (P~rated,c,\ TABC~ in D.49. D.51);

$$\ \text{Average\ power\ per\ RE\ }(P_{\text{avg}})\  = \ \frac{P_{rated,c,TABC\ }}{N_{\text{RB}} \times N_{\text{SC}}^{\text{RB}}}\left\lbrack W \right\rbrack$$

\- The power of boosted NB-IoT RE (P~NB-IoT~) for the SAN is calculated
according to manufacturer\'s declared rated NB-IoT maximum power dynamic
range (X dB \>= 6 dB or 3 dB), with the power boosting only applies on
the N~NB\_IoT~ REs containing NB-IoT signal.

$$\ \text{Power\ of\ boosted\ NB-IoT\ RE\ }(P_{\text{NB-IoT}})\  = \text{\ }\text{P}_{\text{avg}}\text{*1}\text{0}^{(\text{X/10})}\ \left\lbrack W \right\rbrack$$

\- The remaining power is allocated to N~NR~ NR REs.

$$\ \text{Power\ of\ per\ NR\ RE\ } = \frac{\left( P_{\text{rated},c,\text{TABC}}{- P}_{\text{NB} - \text{IoT}} \times N_{\text{NB} - \text{IoT}} \right)}{N_{\text{NR}}}\ \left\lbrack W \right\rbrack$$

#### 4.9.2.3 Data content of Physical channels and Signals for NR-SAN-FR1-TM

Randomisation of the data content is obtained by utilizing a PN sequence
generator and the length-31 Gold sequence scrambling of TS 38.211 \[8\],
clause 5.2.1 which is invoked by all physical channels prior to
modulation and mapping to the RE grid.

Initialization of the scrambler and RE-mappers as defined in
TS 38.211 \[8\] use the following additional parameters:

\- $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 1$ for the lowest configured carrier,
$N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 2\ $for the 2^nd^ lowest configured
carrier,..., $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = n$ for the n^th^ configured
carrier

\- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PDCCH

\- *q* = 0 (single code word)

\- Rank 1, single layer

\- Antenna port starting with 1000 for PDSCH

##### 4.9.2.3.1 PDCCH

\- $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{CORESET}} = \ 2$

\- PDCCH modulation to be QPSK as described in TS 38.211 \[8\],
clause 5.1.3

\- For each slot the required amount of bits for all PDCCHs is as
follows: 1(\# of PDCCH) \* 1(\# of CCE per PDCCH) \* 6(REG per CCE) \*
9(data RE per REG) \* 2(bits per RE) with these parameters according to
the NR-SAN-FR1-TM definitions in clause 4.9.2.2

\- Generate this amount of bits from the output of the PN23 sequence
generator \[10\]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with a
starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each frame.
The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries.

\- 1 CCE shall be according to TS 38.211 \[8\], clause 7.3.2 using
non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping. PDCCH occupies the first 2 symbols
for 6 resource-element groups, where a resource element group equals one
resource block during one OFDM symbol.

\- Perform PDCCH scrambling according to TS 38.211 \[8\], clause 7.3.2.3

\- $N_{\text{ID}} = N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ in DM-RS sequence
generation in TS 38.211 \[8\], clause 7.4.1.3

\- $n_{\text{RNTI}} = 0$ in scrambling sequence generation in
TS 38.211 \[8\], clause 7.3.2.3

\- Perform mapping to REs according to TS 38.211 \[8\], clause 7.3.2.5.

##### 4.9.2.3.2 PDSCH

\- Generate the required amount of bits from the output of the PN23
sequence generator \[10\]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with
a starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each
frame. The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries. For TMs
with multi-users, the PN sequence can be generated per user (*n*~RNTI~
).

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TMs utilize 1, 2 or 3 user PDSCH transmissions
distinguished by $n_{\text{RNTI}}$. For each NR-SAN-FR1-TM, PRBs are
mapped to user ($n_{\text{RNTI}}$) as follows:

This model shall be used for tests on:

\- Output power dynamics

\- Total power dynamic range (upper OFDM symbol TX power limit (OSTP) at
max power with all PRBs allocated)

\- Transmitted signal quality

\- Frequency error

\- EVM for modulation (at max power)

NOTE: EVM shall be evaluated over PDSCH allocated PRBs with
$n_{\text{RNTI}} = 0$ and $n_{\text{RNTI}} = 2.$

Common physical channel parameters are defined in clause 4.9.2.4.

generator and the length-31 Gold sequence scrambling of TS 38.211 \[8\],
clause 5.2.1 which is invoked by all physical channels prior to
modulation and mapping to the RE grid.

Initialization of the scrambler and RE-mappers as defined in
TS 38.211 \[8\] use the following additional parameters:

\- $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 1$ for the lowest configured carrier,
$N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 2\ $for the 2^nd^ lowest configured
carrier,..., $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = n$ for the n^th^ configured
carrier

follows: 1(\# of PDCCH) \* 1(\# of CCE per PDCCH) \* 6(REG per CCE) \*
9(data RE per REG) \* 2(bits per RE) with these parameters according to
the NR-SAN-FR2-TM definitions in clause 4.9.2.4

\- Generate this amount of bits from the output of the PN23 sequence
generator \[10\]. The PN sequence generator is initialized with a
starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each frame.
The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries.

\- 1 CCE shall be according to TS 38.211 \[8\], clause 7.3.2 using
non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping. PDCCH occupies the first 2 symbols
for 6 resource-element groups, where a resource element group equals one
resource block during one OFDM symbol.

\- Perform PDCCH scrambling according to TS 38.211 \[8\], clause 7.3.2.3

\- $N_{\text{ID}} = N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}}$ in DM-RS sequence

with multi-users, the PN sequence can be generated per user (*n*~RNTI~
).

\- NR-SAN-FR2-TMs utilize 1 or 2 user PDSCH transmissions distinguished
by $n_{\text{RNTI}}$. For each NR-SAN-FR2-TM, PRBs are mapped to user
($n_{\text{RNTI}}$) as follows:

4.11 Reference coordinate system
--------------------------------

Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic
characteristics (e.g. EIRP and EIS) at certain angles with respect to
the base station. To be able to declare radiated characteristics part of
radiated requirements a reference coordinate system is required. The
reference coordinate system is should be associated to an identifiable
physical feature on the base station enclosure. The location of the
origin and the orientation of the reference coordinate system are for
the base station manufacturer to declare.

The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate
system with rectangular axis (x***,*** y***,*** z) and spherical angles
(θ, φ) as showed in figure 4.11-1.

height="4.066666666666666in"}

Figure 4.11-1: Reference coordinate system

φ*** ***is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the
projection of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined
between -180° and +180°, inclusive. θ*** *** is the angle between the
projection of the vector in the x***/***y plane and the radiating vector
and is defined between -90° and +90°, inclusive. Note that θ is defined
as positive along the down-tilt angle.

### 6.3.4 NB-IoT RB power dynamic range for NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band

#### 6.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The NB-IoT RB power dynamic range (or NB-IoT power boosting) for NB-IoT
operation in NTN NR in-band is the difference between the average power
of NB-IoT REs (which occupy certain REs within a NR transmission
bandwidth configuration plus 15 kHz at each edge but not within the NR
minimum guard band GB~Channel~) and the average power over all REs (from
both NB-IoT and the NR carrier containing the NB-IoT REs).

#### 6.3.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector*.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 6.3.4.2.

#### 6.3.4.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the NB-IoT RB power dynamic range for
NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band is met as specified by the minimum
requirement.

#### 6.3.4.4 Method of test

Requirement is tested together with operating band unwanted emissions
test, as described in clause 6.6.4.

#### 6.3.4.5 Test requirements

NB-IoT RB power dynamic range for NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
shall be larger than or equal to the level specified in Table 6.3.4.5-1
or the NB-IoT power dynamic range declared by the SAN manufacturer
(D63). This power dynamic range level is only required for one NB-IoT
RB.

6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
-------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

6.5 Transmitted signal quality
------------------------------

### 6.5.1 General

The requirements in clause 6.5 apply during the *transmitter ON period*.

### 6.5.2 Frequency error

#### 6.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual SAN
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

It is not possible to verify by testing that the data clock is derived
from the same frequency source as used for RF generation. This may be
confirmed by the manufacturer\'s declaration.

For *SAN type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 6.5.1.2.

#### 6.5.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that frequency error is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.2.4 Method of test

Requirement is tested together with modulation quality test, as
described in clause 6.5.3.

#### 6.5.2.5 Test Requirements

The modulated carrier frequency of each NR carrier configured by the SAN
shall be accurate to within 0.05 ppm + 12 Hz (tolerance) observed over 1
ms.

The frequency error requirement for NB-IoT is specified in
TS 36.181 \[23\] clause 6.5.2.5.

### 6.5.3 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector.

For *SAN type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 6.5.2.2.

#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that modulation quality is within the
limit specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.3.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.1.1 for *SAN type 1-H*. Whichever method is
used the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only (D.39), set the *TAB connector* under test to transmit a
signal according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8
using the corresponding test models:

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1 if 64QAM is supported by SAN without power back off,
or

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1 at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if
64QAM is supported by SAN with power back off, and NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.2 at
maximum power, or

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by SAN is
16QAM, or

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.3 if highest modulation order supported by SAN is
QPSK.

For *TAB connector* declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation,
set the *TAB connector* under test to transmit according to the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on all
carriers configured:

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1 if 64QAM is supported by SAN without power back off,
or

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1 at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if
64QAM is supported by SAN with power back off, and NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.2 at
maximum power, or

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by SAN is
16QAM, or

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.3 if highest modulation order supported by SAN is
QPSK.

For NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1, power back-off shall be applied if it is declared.

2\) Measure the EVM and frequency error as defined in annex H.

#### 6.5.3.5 Test requirements

The EVM of each NR carrier for different modulation schemes on PDSCH
shall be less than the limits in table 6.5.3.5-1.

Table 6.5.3.5-1 EVM requirements for *SAN type 1-H carrier*

  Modulation scheme for PDSCH                    Required EVM

  NOTE: EVM requirement for 64QAM is optional.   

EVM shall be evaluated for each NR carrier over all allocated resource
blocks and downlink slots. Different modulation schemes listed in table
6.5.3.5-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

For all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for each NR
carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink slots within
10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM measurement periods
need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The modulation quality requirements for NB-IoT are specified in
TS 36.181 \[23\] clause 6.5.3.5.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[4\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *SAN
channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the SAN transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and out-of-band emissions (OOBE). There is in addition a requirement for
occupied bandwidth.

Table 6.6.1-1: Void

For *SAN type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied to sum
of power over all *TAB connectors* for all the configurations supported
by the SAN, except for occupied bandwidth in subclause 6.6.2.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[5\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also
be regional requirements to declare the occupied bandwidth according to
the definition in the present clause.

For SAN *type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement for *SAN* *type 1-H* is defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 6.6.2.

#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *TAB connector*
does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided
and is, therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of
the spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

1\) Connect the measurement device to the *TAB connector* as shown in
annex D.1.1 for *SAN type 1-H*.

2\) For a SAN declared to be capable of single carrier operation (D.39),
start transmission according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.1 at
manufacturer\'s declared *rated carrier output power per TAB connector*
(P~rated,c,TABC~, D.34).

\- For a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR
in-band (D.60), test shall be performed using NR-N-TM according to
clause 4.9.2.2.7.

##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in
table 6.6.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the
analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.

measurements

+--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+
| Minimum number of measurement points | 400                   | 400 | 400 | 400 |
+--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode must be power responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the
average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the
measurement cell.

2\) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the power outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total power outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005
times P0.

3\) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds
P1.

4\) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.

5\) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.

#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirements

The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.108 \[2\], table 5.3.5-1 for *SAN type
1-H*.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.6.3.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the Satellite Access Node RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered
(e.g. single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector* supporting
transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* is defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 6.6.3.4.

#### 6.6.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement
shall be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.6.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*Satellite Access Node RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for
multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.3.4.2 Procedure

For *SAN type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.1 for *SAN type 1-H*. Whichever method
is used the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary
to demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *SAN type
1-H*. All connectors not under test shall be terminated.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.6.3.5.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.

> 2\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier
> operation only (D.39), set the representative connectors under test to
> transmit according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8
> using the corresponding test models NR-SAN-FR1‑TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2
> at *rated carrier output power* P~rated,c,TABC~ for *SAN type 1-H*
> (D.34).

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding
test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

For a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
(D.60), test shall be performed using N-TM according to
clause 4.9.2.2.7.

3\) Measure ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel
frequency as specified in table 6.6.3.5.2‑1. In multiple carrier case
only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.

4\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to NR-SAN-FR1-TM
1.2 in clause 4.9.2.

#### 6.6.3.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.3.5.1 General requirements

The ACLR requirements in clause 6.6.3.5.2 shall apply as described in
clauses 6.6.3.5.3 or 6.6.3.5.4.

##### 6.6.3.5.2 Limits

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table
6.6.3.5.2-1/2.

### 6.6.4 Out-of-band emissions

#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, the out-of-band emission (OOBE) limits for SAN
in FR1 are defined from BW~SAN~ channel edge up to frequencies separated
from the BW~SAN~ channel edge by 200% of the *necessary bandwidth, where
the necessary bandwidth is* BW~SAN~.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification.

*Basic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the BW~SAN~ *channel edge* frequency and
the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- $\Delta_{Sat\_ Class}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack$ is the
*SAN class parameter* in dB identified to characterize different SAN
classes.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector* supporting
transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* is defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 6.6.4.2.

#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier: B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure

For *SAN type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* under test to measurement
equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors not under test shall
be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be: Detection mode: True
RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in table
4.1.2.2-1.

2\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the representative connectors under test to transmit according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at manufacturer\'s
declared *rated carrier output power per TAB connector*
(P~rated,c,TABC~, D.34). Channel set-up shall be according to
NR-SAN-FR1-TM 1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding
test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

For a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
(D.60), test shall be performed using NR-N-TM according to
clause 4.9.2.2.7.

3\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth.

4\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases, with the channel
set-up according to NR-SAN-FR1-TM 1.2.

#### 6.6.4.5 Test requirements

For SAN operating in bands defined in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 5.2, the
out-of-band emissions (OOBE) requirements for GEO and LEO classes are
defined as described in table 6.6.4.5‑1, in line with Annex 5 of ITU
recommendation SM.1541-6 \[6\].

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 30 MHz to 11
GHz, excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and the frequency
range where the out-of-band emissions apply.

The lower limit and upper limit are as per ITU-R recommendation SM.329
\[4\], Table 1: For systems operating within 600 MHz and 5.2 GHz, the
lower limit is 30 MHz and the upper limit is the 5^th^ harmonic of the
higher frequency.

The lower limit of 30 MHz can be replaced as per ITU-R SM.329 \[4\]:
Systems having an integral antenna incorporating a waveguide section, or
with an antenna connection in such form, and of unperturbed length equal
to at least twice the cut-off wavelength, do not require spurious domain
emission measurements below 0.7 times the waveguide cut-off frequency.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(e.g. single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission
modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

The requirements shall apply to SAN that support NR or NR with NB-IoT
operation in NR in-band.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector* supporting
transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* is defined in Table
6.6.5.5.1.1-1.

#### 6.6.5.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.6.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below the lower frequency edge
of the *SAN transponder bandwidth* minus 2 times BW~SAN,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above the upper frequency edge
of the *SAN transponder bandwidth* plus 2 times BW~SAN~; see
clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below the lower
frequency edge of the *SAN transponder bandwidth* minus 2 times BW~SAN~
; T~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies above the upper
frequency edge of the *SAN transponder bandwidth* plus 2 times BW~SAN~
in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.5.4.2 Procedure

For *SAN type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* under test to measurement
equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *SAN type 1-H*. All connectors not
under test shall be terminated with a matched load.

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.6.5.5.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.39), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* (P~rated,c,TABC~, D.34). Channel set-up shall be
according to NR-FR1-TM 1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation (D.39) set the connector under test to transmit on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

For a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
(D.60), test shall be performed using NR-N-TM according to
clause 4.9.2.2.7.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at the *TAB connector*
for *SAN type 1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge.

\- Requirements shall also apply for SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in
NTN NR in-band. The corresponding NB-IoT requirements are specified in
clause 7 of TS 36.181 \[23\].

NOTE: In normal operating condition the SAN is configured to transmit
and receive at the same time.

For *SAN type 1-H* if a number of *TAB connectors* have been declared
equivalent (D.37), only a representative one is necessary to demonstrate
conformance.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level
-------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* at which a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 7.2.2.

### 7.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that for the *SAN type 1-H* receiver at the reference
sensitivity level the throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.4 Method of test

#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *SAN type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.1 for *SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Set the SAN to transmit a signal using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7
and 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical channels
in clause 4.9.2, for *SAN type 1-H* set the *TAB connector* to the
manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,TABC~,
D.34).

3\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit the
Fixed Reference Channels for reference sensitivity according to annex
A.1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal power as specified in
clause 7.2.5.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

### 7.2.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.5-1 and 7.2.5-2 for *SAN type 1-H* in all operating band in
FR1-NTN.

The reference sensitivity level requirements for NB-IoT are specified in
clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.181 \[23\].

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

### 7.3.1 Definition and applicability

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* inside the received
*SAN channel bandwidth*. In this condition, a throughput requirement
shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel. The
interfering signal for the dynamic range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 7.3.2.

### 7.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the each *SAN type 1-H* *TAB connector* receiver dynamic
range, the relative throughput shall fulfil the specified limit.

### 7.3.4 Method of test

#### 7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.3.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *SAN type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.2 for *SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.3.5-1 according to the appropriate SAN class as
well as table 7.3.5-1a for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT
operation in NTN in-band (D.60).

3\) Set the Signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table 7.3.5-1
according to the appropriate SAN class as well as table 7.3.5-1a for a
SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2 as well as annex A.15
of TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

### 7.3.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.5-1 for SAN LEO class.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in Annex A of TS 36.181 \[23\] with parameters specified in table
7.3.5-1a for SAN LEO class.

This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *SAN channel bandwidth*.

7.4 In-band sensitivity and blocking
------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
*TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent
channel signal with a specified centre frequency offset of the
interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 7.4.1.2.

#### 7.4.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the SAN receiver filter to
suppress interfering signals in the channels adjacent to the wanted
channel.

#### 7.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 7.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier (MC):

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,

##### 7.4.1.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *SAN type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *SAN type 1-H*.

2\) For FDD operation, set the SAN to transmit:

\- For single carrier operation set the connector under test to transmit
at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,TABC~,
D.34).

\- For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation (D.39) set the connector under test to transmit on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.1.5-1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.1.5-1 and 7.4.1.5-2.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

#### 7.4.1.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For SAN, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *SAN type
1-H* *TAB connector* are specified in table 7.4.1.5-1 and the frequency
offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2 for
ACS. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified
in annex E.

For SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the wanted and
the interfering signal coupled to the *SAN* *type 1-H* *antenna
connector* are specified in table 7.4.1.5-1 and the frequency offset
between the wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5-2 for ACS.
The reference measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is
identified in clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.181 \[23\]. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex E.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the SAN RF Bandwidth or Radio
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the SAN
RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

Conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *SAN type
1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking
------------------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB
connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer
out of the *operating band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band
blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *BS type 1-H* are defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 7.5.2.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

To verify that for each *TAB connector* receiver dynamic range, the
relative throughput shall fulfil the specified limit.

### 7.5.4 Method of test

#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier (MC):
M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors* under test.
For *SAN type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3.

2\) For FDD operation, set the SAN to transmit a signal according to
clause 4.9.2, connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

The transmitter may be turned OFF for the out-of-band blocker tests when
the frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall
inside the bandwidth of the wanted signal.

3\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal as defined in
clause 7.5.5 to transmit as specified in table 7.5.5-1.

4\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.5.5-1. The CW
interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz over than
range 1 MHz to (F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~) MHz and (F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~)
MHz to 12750 MHz.

5\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

### 7.5.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*SAN type 1-H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in table 7.5.5-1.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 for each *SAN channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to *SAN type 1-H* *TAB
connector* using the parameters in table 7.5.5.1-1. The reference
measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.181 \[23\]. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex E.

The out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to F~UL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz, including the
downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band* for SAN. The
Δf~OOB~ for *SAN type 1-H* is defined in table 7.5.5-2.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *SAN
type 1-H.*

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.
*TAB connectors* shall always support both TX and RX.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at the
*TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an interfering
signal received at a larger power spectral density. In this condition a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be an NR signal which
is time aligned with the wanted signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H* are in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 7.8.2.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the SAN receiver ability to
suppress the IQ leakage.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.8.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *SAN type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified from table 7.8.5-1 and 7.8.5-2 as well as table 7.8.5-1a and
7.8.5-2a for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR
in-band (D.60).

2\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified from table 7.8.5-1 and 7.8.5-2 as
well as table 7.8.5-2a and 7.8.5-2b for a SAN declared to be capable of
NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

3\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

### 7.8.5 Test requirements

For *SAN type 1-H*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.8.5-1 for SAN GEO class, in
table 7.8.5-2 for SAN LEO class. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex E.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in Annex A of TS 36.181 \[23\] with parameters specified in table
7.8.5-1a for SAN LEO class, in table 7.8.5-2a for SAN LEO class.

8 Conducted performance characteristics
=======================================

8.1 General
-----------

### 8.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *SAN type
1-H* to correctly transmit and receive signals in various conditions and
configurations. Conducted performance requirements are specified at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *SAN type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the SAN are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in TS 38.108 \[2\] annex A and for the
propagation conditions defined in Recommendation ITU-R P.618
(*Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of
Earth-space telecommunication systems*).

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a SAN supporting *carrier
aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *TAB connectors* (for *SAN type 1-H*)
in the *operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions, *TAB connectors* (for *SAN type
1-H*) in FDD operation are configured to transmit and receive at the
same time. The associated transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the
tests.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

> SNR = S / N

Where:

> *S* is the total signal power in the slot on a single on a single *TAB
> connector* (for *SAN type 1-H*).
>
> *N* is the noise density integrated in a bandwidth corresponding to
> the *transmission bandwidth* over the same duration where signal
> energy exists on a single *TAB connector* (for *SAN type 1-H)*.

### 8.1.2 Applicability rule

#### 8.1.2.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, for a SAN supporting different numbers of *TAB
connectors* (for *SAN type 1-H*) (see D.48 in table 4.6-1), the tests
with low MIMO correlation level shall apply only for the highest number
of supported connectors, and the specific connectors used for testing
are based on manufacturer declaration. If performance requirement is not
specified for the highest number of supported connectors, the tests
shall be done by using performance requirement for the closest number of
connectors lower than this highest number of supported connectors.

#### 8.1.2.2 Applicability of PUSCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.2.2.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.2.2 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the
SAN supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.2.2.3 Applicability of requirements for different configurations

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
the mapping type declared to be supported (see D.100 in table 4.6-1). If
both mapping type A and type B are declared to be supported, the tests
shall be done for either type A or type B; the same chosen mapping type
shall then be used for all tests.

##### 8.1.2.2.4 Applicability of PUSCH repetition type A requirements

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH repetition type A requirements shall
apply only for a SAN declaring support of low spectral efficiency MCS
index table 3 and PUSCH repetition type A (see D.106 and D.107 in table
4.6-1).

#### 8.1.2.3 Applicability of PUCCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.2.3.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PUCCH format declared to be supported (see D.101 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.3.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.3.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported by the SAN, the
test requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if
the SAN supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.2.3.4 Applicability of requirements for different configurations

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 3 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.103 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 4 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.104 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

##### 8.1.2.3.5 Applicability of requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

Unless otherwise stated, multi-slot PUCCH requirement tests shall apply
only if the SAN supports it (see D.105 in table 4.6-1).

#### 8.1.2.4 Applicability of PRACH performance requirements 

##### 8.1.2.4.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats

Unless otherwise stated, PRACH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PRACH format declared to be supported (see D.102 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.4.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, for each PRACH format with short sequence
declared to be supported, for each FR, the tests shall apply only for
the smallest supported subcarrier spacing in the FR (see D.102 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.4.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

Unless otherwise stated, for the subcarrier spacing to be tested, the
test requirements shall apply only for anyone channel bandwidth declared
to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

#### 8.1.2.5 Applicability of performance requirements for PUSCH with DM-RS bundling

##### 8.1.2.5.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH with DM-RS bundling requirement tests
shall apply only for each subcarrier spacings

declared to be supported (see D.108 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.5.2 Applicability of requirements for different receiver antenna connectors

Unless otherwise stated, for a SAN supporting different numbers of TAB
connectors (for SAN type 1-H) (see D.37 in table 4.6-1), the PUSCH with
DM-RS bundling performance tests with low MIMO correlation level shall
apply only for the highest numbers of supported connectors, and the
specific connectors used for testing are based on manufacturer
declaration.

8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

#### 8.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.2.1.

#### 8.2.1.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
SAN *type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.1.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

### 8.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 8.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.2.2.

#### 8.2.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
SAN *type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel
bandwidth, defined in table 8.2.2.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                             
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ---------------------

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameters in table 8.2.2.4.2-2.

### 8.2.3 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment

#### 8.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput measured for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Table A.3-1 are applied for both UEs. The received power
for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are
consecutive.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.2.3.

#### 8.2.3.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
measured for the moving UE at given SNR under moving propagation
conditions.

#### 8.2.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
SAN *type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to combination of SCS and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.2.3.4.2-1.

  Sub-carrier spacing (kHz)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Channel bandwidth (MHz)   AWGN power level

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                             

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signals (transmitted by moving UE)
shall be configured according to the corresponding UL reference
measurement channel defined in annex A and the test parameters in Table
8.2.3.4.2-2.

### 8.2.4 Performance requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

#### 8.2.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with slot aggregation factor
configured is determined by a minimum required throughput measured for a
given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum
throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance requirements
assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.4.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.2.4.

#### 8.2.4.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
measured with PUSCH repetition Type A under multipath fading propagation
conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.4.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.4.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
*SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.4.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                             
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ---------------------

according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameters in table 8.2.4.4.2-2.

### 8.2.5 Performance requirements for PUSCH with DMRS bundling

#### 8.2.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with DMRS bundling is determined by
a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput
is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause \[8.1.2.9\].

#### 8.2.5.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause \[8.2.5\].

#### 8.2.5.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR with DMRS
bundling.

#### 8.2.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.5.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
*SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.5.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                             
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ---------------------

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameters in table 8.2.5.4.2-2.

8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.

#### 8.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.3.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
*SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.1.4.2-1.

  15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             5                             -83.5 dBm / 4.5 MHz
  30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             10                            -80.6 dBm / 8.64 MHz
  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                                 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

##### 8.3.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 8.3.2.1.4 Method of test

#### 8.3.2.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.3.

##### 8.3.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.2.2.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

###### 8.3.2.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
*SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.2.2.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

4\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.

5\) Adjusting the equipment so that the SNR specified in table
8.3.2.2.5-1 and table 8.3.2.2.5-2 is achieved at the SAN input during
the transmissions.

6\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods. The following statistics are kept:
the number of ACK bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the
number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle
periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK
detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one error for the
statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in clause 8.3.2.1.4.2
for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are measured in the same
testing.

##### 8.3.2.2.5 Test Requirement

The fraction of falsely detected ACK bits shall be less than 1% and the
fraction of correctly detected ACK bits shall be larger than 99% for the
SNR listed in tables 8.3.2.2.5-1 and table 8.3.2.2.5-2.

### 8.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 2

#### 8.3.3.1 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 2 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.3.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.4.

##### 8.3.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.3.1.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.3.1.4.1 Initial Condition

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

###### 8.3.3.1.4.2 Procedure

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

#### 8.3.3.2 UCI BLER performance requirements

##### 8.3.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.3.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.4.

##### 8.3.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

### 8.3.4 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

#### 8.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.3.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.5.

#### 8.3.4.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.4.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.3.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
*SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.3.4.4.2-1.

Table 8.3.4.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the SAN input

  **Sub-carrier spacing (kHz)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  **Channel bandwidth (MHz)**   **AWGN power level**

  30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             10                            -80.6 dBm / 8.64 MHz
  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                                 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------

### 8.3.6 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

#### 8.3.6.1 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1

##### 8.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection

###### 8.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of multi-slot PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK
to ACK detection equal to 0.1 % or less. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 1 % or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.7.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

###### 8.3.6.1.1.4 Method of test

####### 8.3.6.1.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

####### 8.3.6.1.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for
*SAN type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the combinations of SCS and
channel bandwidth defined in Table 8.3.6.1.1.4.2-1.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

##### 8.3.6.1.2 ACK missed detection

###### 8.3.6.1.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

###### 8.3.6.1.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.3.7.

###### 8.3.6.1.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

###### 8.3.6.1.2.4 Method of test

####### 8.3.6.1.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

####### 8.3.6.1.2.4.2 Procedure

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

5\) Adjusting the equipment so that the SNR specified in table
8.3.6.1.2.5-1 and table 8.3.6.1.2.5-2 is achieved at the SAN input
during the transmissions.

6\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods. The following statistics are kept:
the number of ACK bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the
number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle
periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK
detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one error for the
statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in
clause 8.3.6.1.1.4.2 for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are
measured in the same testing.

8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
--------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection

#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is
determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection
of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd).
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.

Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection
of the preamble (i.e., erroneous detection from any detector) when input
is only noise.

Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble
when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several
error cases -- detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that
was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct
preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value.

For AWGN and NTN-TDLA100-200, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the
time error tolerance values given in table 8.4.1.1-1.

  ---------- ----------- ---------------------- -----------------

The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.4-1.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 8.4.1.2.

#### 8.4.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect PRACH preamble
under static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for
a given SNR.

#### 8.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.4.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in D.6 for *SAN* *type 1-H*.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel
bandwidth.

  NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.                             
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ---------------------

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

4\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.

5\) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table
8.4.1.5-1 or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3.

6\) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.4.1.5-1 or
8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 is achieved at the SAN input during the PRACH
preambles.

7\) The test signal generator sends a preamble, and the receiver tries
to detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in
figure 8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets
as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of
preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed
preambles.

Figure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50%
of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step
a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us.
Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50%
of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 and format
2 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.

Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 and
format 2

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2 is set
to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a
value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.8 us. Then
the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The
timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2 is presented in
figure 8.4.1.4.2-3.

9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

9.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. SAN configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.

If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.13, D.14), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.

9.2 Radiated transmit power
---------------------------

### 9.2.1 Definition and applicability

Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam
at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each declared beam, the requirement is based on declarations given
in clause 4.6 for a beam identifier (D.3), *reference beam direction
pair* (D.8), *rated beam EIRP* (D.11) at the beam\'s reference direction
pair, *OTA peak directions set* (D.9), the *beam direction pairs* at the
maximum steering directions (D.10) and their associated *rated beam
EIRP* and *beam width(s)* for reference *beam direction pair* and
maximum steering directions (D.12).

For a declared beam identifier and *beam direction pair*, the *rated
beam EIRP* level is the maximum power that the SAN is declared to
radiate at the associated *beam peak direction.*

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in clause 9.2.4.1.

NOTE 1: The *OTA peak directions set* for a beam is the complete
continuous or discrete set of all *beam direction* for which the EIRP
requirement is achieved for the beam.

NOTE 2: A beam direction pair consists of a beam centre direction and an
associated beam peak direction.

Radiated transmit power is directional requirement applicable to *SAN
type 1-H*, *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O*.

### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement

Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN
type 1-O* is defined in TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 9.2.2.

Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O* is
defined in TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 9.2.3.

### 9.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability to accurately generate and
direct radiated power per beam, across the frequency range and under
normal conditions, for all declared beams of the *SAN type 1-H, SAN type
1-O and SAN type 2-O*.

### 9.2.4 Method of test

#### 9.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Test to be performed on environment as declared by the
manufacturer.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA peak directions set reference beam direction pair (D.8), and

\- OTA peak directions set maximum steering directions (D.10).

Beams to be tested: A representative number of beams shall be chosen to
demonstrate the SAN conformance to radiated power requirements.

#### 9.2.4.2 Procedure

The test procedure is as follows:

1\) Place the satellite on the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the satellite with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner and satellite in order that the direction to
be tested aligns with the test antenna.

4\) Configure the *beam peak direction* of the satellite according to
the declared *beam direction pair*.

5\) Set the SAN to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in
clause 4.9.2.

For a SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation use the
applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s)
in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

6\) Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and
p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

7\) Test steps 3 to 6 are repeated for all declared beams (D.3) and
their reference *beam direction pairs* and *maximum steering directions*
(D.8 and D.10).

For multi-band capable SAN and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved *operating band* where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 9.2.5 Test requirement

For each declared conformance *beam direction pair*, the EIRP
measurement results in clause 9.2.4.2 shall remain within the values
provided in table 9.2.5-1, relative to the manufacturer\'s declared
rated beam EIRP (D.11) value:

Table 9.2.5-1: Test requirement for radiated transmit power

                               Normal test environment
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------
  SAN type 1-H, SAN type 1-O   f ≤ 3 GHz: ± 3.3 dB
  *SAN type 2-O*               17.3 GHz \< f ≤ 20.2 GHz: ± 5.1 dB

NOTE: For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the NR carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth,
the total radiated power is shared between NR and NB-IoT. This note
shall apply for P~max,c,TRP~ and P~rated,c,TRP~.

9.3 OTA SAN output power
------------------------

### 9.3.1 Definition and applicability

OTA SAN output power is declared as rated carrier TRP.

### 9.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* is specified in TS 38.108,
clause 9.3.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O* is specified in TS 38.108,
clause 9.3.

### 9.3.3 Test purpose

#### 9.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Test to be performed on environment as declared by the
manufacturer.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M, T; see clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

Beams to be tested:

As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise
the TRP measurement procedure as long as the required TRP level is
achieved.

#### 9.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements.

1\) Place the satellite on the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the satellite with the test system.

3\) Configure the satellite such that the beam peak direction(s) applied
during the power measurement step 6 are consistent with the grid and
measurement approach for the TRP test.

4\) Set the SAN to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in
clause 4.9.2.

For a SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation use the
applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s)
in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

5\) Orient the positioner and satellite in order that the direction to
be tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to
determine TRP can be performed.

6\) Measure the radiated power for any two orthogonal polarizations
(denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for
particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.

7\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation

8\) Calculate TRP using the EIRP measurements.

For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where
single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no
carriers activated in the other band.

### 9.3.5 Test requirement

#### 9.3.5.1 SAN type 1-O

The final TRP measurement result in clause 9.3.4.2 shall remain:

\- within +3.4 dB and -3.4 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared *rated
carrier TRP* P~rated,c,TRP~ carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz;

NOTE: For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the NR carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth,
the total radiated power is shared between NR and NB-IoT.

#### 9.3.5.2 SAN type 2-O

The final TRP measurement result in clause 9.3.4.2 shall remain:

\- within +5.1 dB and -5.1 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared *rated
carrier TRP* P~rated,c,TRP~ carrier frequency 17.3 GHz \< f ≤ 20.2 GHz;

9.4 OTA output power dynamics
-----------------------------

### 9.4.1 General

The requirements in clause 9.4 apply during the *transmitter ON period*.
Transmit signal quality (as specified in clause 9.6) shall be maintained
for the output power dynamics requirements.

The OTA output power requirements are single direction requirements and
apply to the beam peak directions over the OTA peak directions set.

### 9.4.2 OTA RE power control dynamic range

#### 9.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the
power of an RE and the average RE power for a SAN at maximum output
power (P~max,c,EIRP~) for a specified reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

#### 9.4.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 9.4.2.2.

#### 9.4.2.3 Method of test

No specific test or test requirements are defined for RE power control
dynamic range. The Error Vector Magnitude test, as described in
clause 9.6 provides sufficient test coverage for this requirement.

### 9.4.3 OTA total power dynamic range

#### 9.4.3.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum
and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

NOTE: The upper limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the SAN
maximum carrier EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) when transmitting on all RBs. The
lower limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the average EIRP for
single RB transmission in the same direction using the same beam. The
OFDM symbols shall carry PDSCH and not contain PDCCH, RS or SSB.

#### 9.4.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 9.4.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 9.4.3.3.

#### 9.4.3.3 Test purpose

4\) Configure the beam peak direction of the SAN according to the
declared beam direction pair.

5\) For *SAN type 1-O*, set the SAN to transmit a signal according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test models:

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1 if 64QAM is supported by SAN without power back off,
or

\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.1 with all 64QAM PDSCH PRBs replaced by 16QAM PDSCH
PRBs if 64QAM is supported by SAN with power back off, or

The modulation quality requirements for NB-IoT are specified in
TS 36.181 \[23\] clause 9.6.3.5.

##### 9.6.3.5.2 SAN type 2-O

For *SAN type 2-O*, the EVM of each NR carrier for different modulation
schemes on PDSCH shall be less than the limits in table 9.6.3.5.2-1 for
FR2-NTN.

  64QAM                         9

EVM requirements shall apply for each NR carrier over all allocated
resource blocks and downlink slots. PT-RS should be configured for
localized setting for every fourth symbol for every second RB. Different
modulation schemes listed in table 9.6.3.5.2-1 shall be considered for
rank 1.

For FR2-NTN, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed
for each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink
slots within 10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM
measurement periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

9.7 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 9.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[4\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *SAN channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *SAN type 1-O and SAN
type 2-O* is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power
Ratio (ACLR) and out-of-band emissions (OOBE).

Table 9.7.1-1: Void

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, or *directional requirements* as described per requirement.

For the OTA TRP measurement procedures, refer to TS 38.141-2 \[18\],
annex I.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 9.7.2.1 General

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[5\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also
be regional requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according
to the definition in the present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for both *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O* is
defined in TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 9.7.2.2.

#### 9.7.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *RIB* does not
occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is,
therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the
spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 9.7.2.4 Method of test

##### 9.7.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA coverage range reference direction (D.30).

Beams to be tested: Declared beam with the highest intended EIRP for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWθ, or for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWϕ (D.3, D.11).

For SAN declared to be capable of single carrier operation, start
transmission according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.1 for *SAN
type 1-O* or NR-SAN-FR2-TM1.1 for *SAN type 2-O* in clause 4.9.2 at
manufacturers declared rated carrier EIRP (P~rated,c,EIRP~, D.11).

For a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
(D.60), test shall be using NR-N-TM according to clause 4.9.2.2.7.

##### 9.7.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the SAN with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna.

4\) Configure the beam peak direction of the SAN according to the
declared beam direction pair.

5\) Set the SAN to transmit signal.

6\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in
table 9.7.2.4.2-1 and 9.7.2.4.2-2. The selected resolution bandwidth
(RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode is power responding. There are at least two ways to be power
responding. The spectrum analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection,
with its video bandwidth setting at least three times its RBW setting.
Or the analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.

7\) Compute the total of the EIRP, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the EIRP outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total EIRP outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. Measure the EIRP for any two orthogonal
polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit
power for particular *beam direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ +
EIRP~p2~.

8\) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all EIRP in
the measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.

9\) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all EIRP
in the measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.

10\) Compute the OTA occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.

#### 9.7.2.5 Test requirement

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
channel bandwidth as defined in TS 38.108 \[2\], table 5.3.5-1.

### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 9.7.3.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier, the OTA ACLR requirements in
clause 9.7.3.2 apply to *SAN channel bandwidths* of the outermost
carrier.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 9.7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 9.7.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O* is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 9.7.3.3.

#### 9.7.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the OTA adjacent channel leakage ratio requirement shall
be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 9.7.3.4 Method of test

##### 9.7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B and T; see clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier: B~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see TS 38.141-2
\[18\], annex I) as long as the required TRP level is achieved.

##### 9.7.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in TS 38.141-2 \[18\], annex I. An
alternative method to measure TRP is to use a characterized and
calibrated reverberation chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9,
10, and 11.

1\) Place the SAN at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the SAN with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 9.7.3.5.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

\- The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time
duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty
in table 4.1.2.2-2.

4\) For single carrier operation, set the SAN to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier
TRP output power* declared per RIB (P~rated,c,TRP~).

For SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation use the
applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s)
in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

For a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
(D.60), test shall be performed using NR-N-TM according to
clause 4.9.2.2.7.

5\) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see TS 38.141-2 \[18\], annex I).

6\) Measure the absolute power of the assigned channel frequency and the
(adjacent channel frequency).

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see TS 38.141-2 \[18\], annex
I).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the
wanted channel and the adjacent channel using the measurements made in
Step 7.

9\) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.

NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the
assigned channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent
frequency channel.

NOTE 2: For FR1-NTN the measurement uncertainty of the reverberation
chamber for the relative ACLR is higher than the measurement uncertainty
in clause 4.1.2 the test requirements in table 9.7.3.5.1-1 and
9.7.3.5.1-2 shall be tightened following the procedure in clause 4.1.3.

10\) Measure OTA ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel
frequency as specified in table 9.7.3.5.1-1 and 9.7.3.5.1-2 for *SAN
type 1-O or* tables 9.7.3.5.2-1 and 9.7.3.5.2-2 for *SAN type 2-O
respectively*. In multiple carrier case only offset frequencies below
the lowest and above the highest carrier frequency used shall be

11\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up using NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.2 for
*SAN type 1-O*.

#### 9.7.3.5 Test requirements

##### 9.7.3.5.1 SAN type 1-O

The OTA ACLR limit specified in table 9.7.3.5-1 for SAN GEO class and
9.7.3.5-2 for SAN LEO class shall apply.

### 9.7.4 OTA out-of-band emissions

#### 9.7.4.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA limits for out-of-band emissions are specified as TRP per RIB
unless otherwise stated.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier, the requirements apply to *SAN
channel bandwidths* of the outermost carrier.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* is defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 9.7.4.2.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 9.7.4.3.

#### 9.7.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the SAN, close to the assigned
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the SAN is in operation.

#### 9.7.4.4 Method of test

##### 9.7.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier: B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see TS 38.141-2
\[18\], annex I) as long as the required TRP level is achieved.

##### 9.7.4.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in TS 38.141-2 \[18\], annex I. An
alternative method to measure TRP is to use a characterized and
calibrated reverberation chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6.

1\) Place the SAN at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the SAN with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- Measurement filter bandwidth: as defined in clause 6.7.4.5.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in table
4.1.2.2-2.

4\) For single carrier operation, set the SAN to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test model(s) in clause \[4.9.2\] at manufacturers declared *rated
carrier TRP output power* declared per RIB (P~rated,c,TRP~).

For a SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, use the
applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clause \[4.7.2\] and 4.8 using the corresponding test
model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

For a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
(D.60), test shall be performed using NR-N-TM according to
clause 4.9.2.2.7.

5\) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see TS 38.141-2 \[18\], annex I).

6\) Sweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth.

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see TS 38.141-2 \[18\], annex
I).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in step 6.

#### 9.7.4.5 Test requirements

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for *SAN type 1-O* shall not
exceed each applicable limit in 9.7.4.2 of TS 38.108\[2\].

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for *SAN type 2-O* shall not
exceed each applicable limit in 9.7.4.3 of TS 38.108 \[2\].

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier, the requirements
apply to *SAN channel bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the
frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a multi-carrier *single-band RIB* the definitions above apply to the
lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency
and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier
frequency within a specified frequency band.

### 9.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 9.7.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1-NTN shall apply
from 30 MHz to the 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the DL
operating band, excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and
the frequency range where the out-of-band emissions apply.

NOTE 1: The lower limit and upper limit are as per ITU-R recommendation
SM.329 \[4\], Table 1: For systems operating within 600 MHz and 5.2 GHz,
the lower limit is 30 MHz and the upper limit is the 5^th^ harmonic of
the higher frequency.

NOTE 2: The lower limit of 30 MHz can be replaced as per ITU-R
SM.329\[4\]: Systems having an integral antenna incorporating a
waveguide section, or with an antenna connection in such form, and of
unperturbed length equal to at least twice the cut-off wavelength, do
not require spurious domain emission measurements below 0.7 times the
waveguide cut-off frequency.

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR2-NTN shall apply
from 30 MHz to the 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the DL
operating band, excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and
the frequency range where the out-of-band emissions apply.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

#### 9.7.5.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

##### 9.7.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

The general OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements are
specified as TRP per RIB, per cell, unless otherwise specified.

The requirements shall apply to SAN that support NR or NR with NB-IoT
operation in NTN NR in-band.

##### 9.7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* is specified in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O* is specified in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.3.2.

##### 9.7.5.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify if the radiated spurious emissions from
the SAN at the RIB are within the specified minimum requirements.

bandwidth* plus 2 times BW~SAN~ to 5^th^ harmonic

For FR2-NTN:

\- B when testing from 30 MHz to the lower frequency edge of the *SAN
transponder bandwidth* minus 2 times BW~SAN~

\- T when testing from upper frequency edge of the *SAN transponder
bandwidth* plus 2 times BW~SAN~ to 2^nd^ harmonic.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested in single-band multi-carrier
operation, see clause 4.9.1:

transponder bandwidth* plus 2 times BW~SAN~ to 2^nd^ harmonic

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see TS 38.141-2
\[18\], annex I).

###### 9.7.5.2.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on directional power
measurements as described in TS 38.141-2 \[18\], annex I. An alternative
method to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated

9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

10 Radiated receiver characteristic
===================================

10.1 General
------------

General test conditions for receiver tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. SAN configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.

Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB, with full
complement of transceivers for the configuration in normal operating
condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the
radiated receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge.

\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

\- Requirements shall also apply for SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in
NTN NR in-band. The corresponding NB-IoT requirements are specified in
clause 10 of TS 36.181 \[23\].

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the SAN in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

For FR1-NTN requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS
RoAoA* absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for the reference direction

and

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for all other directions

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

For FR2-NTN requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS
RoAoA* absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction

and

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions

10.2 OTA sensitivity
--------------------

### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a *directional requirement* based
upon the declaration of one or more *OTA sensitivity direction
declarations* (OSDD), related to a *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O*
receiver.

The *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O* may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of adjusting SAN
settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity
RoAoA* resulting from the current SAN settings is the active
*sensitivity RoAoA*.

If the SAN is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- *SAN channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target redirection
range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the SAN.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TR 37. 941 \[13\].

> \- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

If the SAN is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related
to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *SAN channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS
level applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

> NOTE 4: For SAN without target redirection capability, the declared
> (fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause 10.2.2 shall be met when the level
of the arriving signal is equal to the minimum EIS level in the
respective declared set of EIS level and *SAN channel bandwidth*.

### 10.2.3 Test Purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the SAN can meet the throughput
requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the
range of angles of arrival declared in the OSDD.

### 10.2.4 Method of test

#### 10.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- receiver target reference direction (D.26),

\- conformance test directions (D.28).

#### 10.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.4.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Align the SAN with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the SAN under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the SAN to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate
test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- The test signal as specified in clause 10.2.5.

8\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the SAN Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified
in clause 10.2.5.

9\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1, as well as annex A.14
of TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band (D.60) for each supported polarization.

10\) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the SAN (D.19),
and supported polarizations.

### 10.2.5 Test requirements

#### 10.2.5.1 General

The minimum EIS level is a declared figure (D.23) for each OSDD (D.19).
The test requirement is calculated from the declared value offset by the
EIS Test Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.

#### 10.2.5.2 Test requirements for *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 9 of
clause 10.2.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters
specified in table 10.2.5.2-1.

10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a *directional requirement* and is
intended to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a
declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement

For SAN *type 1-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 10.3.2.

For *SAN type 2-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 10.3.3.

### 10.3.3 Test Purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the SAN receiver can meet the
throughput requirement for a specified measurement channel at the
EIS~REFSENS~ level and the range of angles of arrival within the *OTA
REFSENS RoAoA*.

### 10.3.4 Method of test

#### 10.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (D.44),

\- OTA REFSENS conformance test directions (D.45)

#### 10.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.4.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Align the SAN with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the SAN under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) Set the SAN to transmit beam(s) of the same operational band as the
*OTA REFSENS RoAoA* being tested according to the appropriate test
configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- The test signal as specified in clause 10.3.5.

8\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the SAN Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified
in clause 10.3.5.

9\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization.

10\) For SAN type 1-O declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN
NR in-band (D.60), measure throughput according to annex A.14 of TS
36.181 \[23\].

11\) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OTA REFSENS conformance test directions
of the SAN (D.45) and supported polarizations.

### 10.3.5 Test requirements

#### 10.3.5.1 General

The EIS~REFSENS~ level is the conducted REFSENS requirement value offset
by Δ~OTAREFSENS~. The test requirement is calculated from the
EIS~REFSENS~ level offset by the EIS~REFSENS~ Test Tolerance specified
in clause 4.1.

#### 10.3.5.2 Test requirements for *SAN type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 9 of
clause 10.3.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters
specified in tables 10.3.5.2-1 and 10.3.5.2-2.

The reference sensitivity level requirements for NB-IoT are specified in
clause 10.3.2 of TS 36.181 \[23\].

#### 10.3.5.3 Test requirements for *SAN type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS\_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *SAN channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ itself is not a
requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *SAN channel bandwidth* it does not imply that SAN has to
support 50 MHz *SAN channel bandwidth*.

For GEO class SAN, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
\[-140\] to \[-149\] dBm. The specific value is declared by the
manufacturer.

For LEO class SAN, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
\[-120\] to \[-129\] dBm. The specific value is declared by the
manufacturer.

10.4 OTA dynamic range
----------------------

### 10.4.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *SAN channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.4.2 Minimum requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 10.4.2.

### 10.4.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that at the SAN receiver dynamic range,
the relative throughput shall fulfil the specified limit.

### 10.4.4 Method of test

#### 10.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal: see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.44).

#### 10.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.4.2.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Align the SAN with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the SAN under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the SAN to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* being tested according to
the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so that the calibrated radiated power
at the SAN Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
follows:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 10.4.5.2-1 as well as table 10.4.5.2-1a for a SAN
declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

b\) Set the signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table
10.4.5.2-1 as well as table 10.4.5.2-1a for a SAN declared to be capable
of NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band (D.60).

8\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2 as well as annex A.15
of TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band (D.60) for each supported polarization.

### 10.4.5 Test requirement

#### 10.4.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA dynamic range Test Tolerance specified in clause
4.1.

#### 10.4.5.2 Test requirements for *SAN type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 6 of
clause 10.4.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters
specified in tables 10.4.5.2-1.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *SAN channel bandwidth*.

10.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking
-----------------------------------------

### 10.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 10.5.1.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system. The wanted and interfering signals apply to
each supported polarization, under the assumption of polarization match.

#### 10.5.1.2 Minimum requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 10.5.1.2.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 10.5.1.3.

#### 10.5.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the SAN receiver filter to
suppress interfering signals in the channels adjacent to the wanted
channel.

#### 10.5.1.4 Method of test

##### 10.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF Bandwidth* edge position to be tested for multi-carrier :

> \- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

Directions to be tested:

\- For SAN type 1-O, receiver target reference direction (D.26),

\- For SAN type 2-O, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.44),

##### 10.5.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.4.2.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Align the SAN with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the SAN so that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s).

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the SAN to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the OSDD or *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* being tested
according to the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so that the calibrated radiated power
at the SAN Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
follows:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 10.5.1.5.2-1 for *SAN type 1-O* *and* table
10.5.1.5.3-1 for *SAN type 2-O.*

b\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal at the adjacent
channel frequency of the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table
10.5.1.5.2-1 for *SAN type 1-O and* table 10.5.1.5.3-1 for *SAN type
2-O*.

8\) Measure throughput according to annex A.1 as well as annex A.14 of
TS 36.181 \[23\] for a SAN declared to be capable of NB-IoT operation in
NTN NR in-band (D.60) for each supported polarization, for multi-carrier
operation the throughput shall be measured for relevant carriers
specified by the test configuration specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8.

#### 10.5.1.5 Test requirement

##### 10.5.1.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA ACS Test Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.

##### 10.5.1.5.2 Test requirements for *SAN type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the
interfering signal are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.5.2-1 and table 10.5.1.5.2-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in
clause 10.5.1.2 and is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in
TS 38.108 \[2\] annex C.

For SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the wanted and
the interfering signal coupled to the *SAN* *type 1-H* *antenna
connector* are specified in table 10.5.1.5.2-1 and the frequency offset
between the wanted and interfering signal in table 10.5.1.5.2-2 for ACS.
The reference measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is
identified in clause 7.2.5 of TS 36.181 \[23\]. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex E.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the SAN RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the SAN RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

##### 10.5.1.5.3 Test requirements for *SAN type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2-NTN, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.5.3-1 and table 10.5.1.5.3-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth*.
The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the SAN *RF
Bandwidth edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 10.5.1.5.3-2. The OTA
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

### 10.5.2 OTA in-band blocking

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

10.6 OTA out-of-band blocking
-----------------------------

### 10.6.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the
receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the *RIB* at its
assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.

For the general OTA out-of-band blocking the requirement applies to the
wanted signal for each supported polarization, under the assumption of
*polarization match.* The interferer shall be polarization matched for
in-band frequencies and the polarization maintained for out-of-band
frequencies.

### 10.6.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* is defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 10.6.2.

The minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.108 \[2\], clause 10.6.3.

### 10.6.3 Test purpose

The test stresses the ability of the receiver unit associated with the
*RIB* under test to withstand high-level interference from unwanted
signals at specified frequency bands, without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

### 10.6.4 Method of test

#### 10.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*SAN RF bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier (MC):
M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- For *SAN type 1-O*, receiver target reference direction (D.26).

\- For SAN *type 2-O*, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.44).

#### 10.6.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place SAN and the test antenna(s) according to annex D.4.3.

2\) Align the SAN and test antenna(s) according to the directions to be
tested.

3\) Connect test antenna(s) to the measurement equipment as shown in
annex D.4.3.

4\) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the
same frequency ranges as the SAN and the blocking frequencies. If the
test antenna does not cover both the wanted and interfering signal
frequencies, separate test antennas for the wanted and interfering
signal are required.

5\) The OTA blocking interferer is injected into the test antenna, with
the blocking interferer producing specified interferer field strength
level for each supported polarization. The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

6\) Generate the wanted signal in receiver target reference direction,
according to the applicable test configuration (see clause 4.8) using
applicable reference measurement channel to the RIB, according to annex
A.1.

7\) For FDD operation, configure the beam peak direction for the
transmitter units associated with the RIB under test according to the
declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier with the carrier set-up and power allocation according to the
applicable test configuration(s) (see clause 4.8). The transmitter may
be turned OFF for the out-of-band blocker tests when the frequency of
the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall inside the
bandwidth of the wanted signal.

8\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals,
levels and the frequency offsets as specified for general test
requirements in table 10.6.5-1. The distance between the test object and
test antenna injecting the interferer signal is adjusted when necessary
to ensure specified interferer signal level to be received.

9\) The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz
within the frequency range specified in clause 10.6.5.

10\) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the receiver unit
associated with the RIB, as defined in the clause 10.6.5, for the
relevant carriers specified by the test configuration in clause 4.7 and
4.8.

11\) Repeat for all supported polarizations.

### 10.6.5 Test requirements for *SAN type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.*

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.5-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *SAN channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

\- For NB-IoT operation in NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel. The
reference measurement channel for the OTA NB-IoT wanted signal is
identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *SAN channel bandwidth* and further
specified in annex A.1.

For *SAN type 1-O* the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from
30 MHz to F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750
MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the SAN *operating band*.
The Δf~OOB~ for *SAN type 1-O* is defined in table 10.6.5-2.

### 10.9.5 Test requirement

#### 10.9.5.1 *SAN type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For *SAN type 1-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.5.1-1 for SAN GEO class, in
table 10.9.5.1-2 for SAN LEO class.

\- For SAN *type 1-O* supporting NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the
throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A of TS 36.181 \[23\] with
parameters specified in table 10.9.5.1-1a for SAN GEO class, in table
10.9.5.1-2a for SAN LEO class.

#### 10.9.5.2 *SAN type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For SAN *type 2-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.5.2-1.

11 Radiated performance requirements
====================================

11.1 General
------------

### 11.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *SAN type
1-O or SAN type 2-O* to correctly transmit and receive radiated signals
in various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance
requirements are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the SAN are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in TS 38.108 \[2\] annex A and for the
propagation conditions defined in Recommendation ITU-R P.618
(*Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of
Earth-space telecommunication systems*). The requirements only apply to
those FRCs that are supported by the SAN.

The radiated performance requirements for *SAN type 1-O and for SAN type
2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulation branches* as described in
clause 11.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches* depending on the number of polarizations
supported by the SAN, with the required SNR applied separately per
polarization.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a SAN
supporting carrier aggregation are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements.

For *SAN type 1-O* in FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall
be met with the transmitter units associated with the RIB in the
*operating* *band* turned ON.

> NOTE 1: *SAN type 1-O* in normal operating conditions in FDD operation
> is configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The
> transmitter unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the
> tests.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided from the SAN to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

> SNR = S / N

Where:

> *S* is the total signal power in a slot on a RIB.
>
> *N* is the noise density integrated in a bandwidth corresponding to
> the *transmission bandwidth* over the duration where signal energy
> exists on a RIB.

### 11.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *SAN type 1-O or the SAN type 2-O* uses polarization diversity
and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each
of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX
test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*, each
demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *SAN type 1-O or the SAN type 2-O* does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for
a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

### 11.1.3 Applicability rule

#### 11.1.3.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, for a SAN declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for *SAN type 1-O and SAN type 2-O*), the
performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply,
and the mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to
SAN implementation.

The tests requiring more than \[20\] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the
test requirements.

#### 11.1.3.2 Applicability of PUSCH performance requirements

##### 11.1.3.2.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table
4.6-1).

##### 11.1.3.2.2 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the
SAN supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 11.1.3.2.3 Applicability of requirements for different configurations

Unless otherwise stated, for *SAN type 1-O*, PUSCH requirement tests
shall apply only for the mapping type declared to be supported (see
D.100 in table 4.6-1). If both mapping type A and type B are declared to
be supported, the tests shall be done for either type A or type B; the
same chosen mapping type shall then be used for all tests.

##### 11.1.3.2.4 Applicability of PUSCH repetition type A requirements

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH repetition type A requirements shall
apply only for a SAN type *1-O* declaring support of low spectral
efficiency MCS index table 3 and PUSCH repetition type A (see D.106 and
D.107 in table 4.6-1).

#### 11.1.3.3 Applicability of PUCCH performance requirements

##### 11.1.3.3.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PUCCH format declared to be supported (see D.101 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.1.3.3.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table
4.6-1).

##### 11.1.3.3.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported by the SAN, the
test requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if
the SAN supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 11.1.3.3.4 Applicability of requirements for different configurations

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 3 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.103 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 4 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.104 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

##### 11.1.3.3.5 Applicability of requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

Unless otherwise stated, multi-slot PUCCH requirement tests shall apply
only if the SAN supports it (see D.105 in table 4.6-1).

#### 11.1.3.4 Applicability of PRACH performance requirements

##### 11.1.3.4.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats

Unless otherwise stated, PRACH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PRACH format declared to be supported (see D.102 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.1.3.4.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, for each PRACH format with short sequence
declared to be supported, for each FR, the tests shall apply only for
the smallest supported subcarrier spacing in the FR (see D.102 in table
4.6-1).

##### 11.1.3.4.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

Unless otherwise stated, for the subcarrier spacing to be tested, the
test requirements shall apply only for anyone channel bandwidth declared
to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

#### 11.1.3.5 Applicability of performance requirements for PUSCH with DM-RS bundling

##### 11.1.3.5.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH with DM-RS bundling requirement tests
shall apply only for each subcarrier spacings

declared to be supported (see D.108 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.1.3.5.2 Applicability of requirements for different receiver antenna connectors

Unless otherwise stated, for a SAN supporting different numbers of TAB
connectors (for SAN type 1-O) (see D.37 in table 4.6-1), the PUSCH with
DM-RS bundling performance tests with low MIMO correlation level shall
apply only for the highest numbers of supported connectors, and the
specific connectors used for testing are based on manufacturer
declaration.

11.2 OTA performance requirements for PUSCH
-------------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

#### 11.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.2.1.1.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.1.

#### 11.2.1.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 11.2.1.4 Method of test

##### 11.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

#### 11.2.1.6 Void

### 11.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 11.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.2.1.2.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.2.2.2.

#### 11.2.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 11.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 11.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.2.2.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex D.7.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the SAN with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed
> in table 11.2.2.4.2-1.

### 11.2.3 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment

#### 11.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput measured for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Table A.3-3 are applied for both UEs. The received power
for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are
consecutive.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.2.1.3.

#### 11.2.3.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
measured for the moving UE at given SNR under moving propagation
conditions.

#### 11.2.3.4 Method of test

##### 11.2.3.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.2.3.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex D.7.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the SAN with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed
> in table 11.2.3.4.2-1.

### 11.2.4 Performance requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

#### 11.2.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with slot aggregation factor
configured is determined by a maximum target BLER for a given SNR. The
required BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the
PUSCH information when the PUSCH information is sent for the FRCs listed
in annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.2.4.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\] clause
11.2.1.4.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38. 108 \[2\]
clause 11.2.2.3.

#### 11.2.4.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve 1% BLER with
PUSCH repetition Type A under multipath fading propagation conditions
for a given SNR.

#### 11.2.4.4 Method of test

##### 11.2.4.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.2.4.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex D.7.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the SAN with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed
> in table 11.2.4.4.2-1.

#### 11.2.4.6 Void

### 11.2.5 Performance requirements for PUSCH with DM-RS bundling

#### 11.2.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with DM-RS bundling is determined
by a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required
throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs
listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ
re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.2.5.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.5.

#### 11.2.5.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR with DM-RS
bundling.

#### 11.2.5.4 Method of test

##### 11.2.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.2.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
11.2.5.4.2-1.

11.3 OTA performance requirements for PUCCH
-------------------------------------------

### 11.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 11.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e., intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.1 and 11.3.1.2.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause \[11.3.2.1 and 11.3.2.2.

#### 11.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 11.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 11.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: single carrier M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.3.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[8\] and according to additional test parameters
listed in table 11.3.1.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.2.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the SAN receiver is as specified in clause 11.3.1.5.1 and
11.3.1.5.2 for *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O* respectively, and that
the SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level quoted in table 11.3.1.4.2-2.

### 11.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 11.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 11.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when a NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e., NACK bits received when DTX is sent should
not be considered.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e., intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

##### 11.3.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For SAN type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.3.

For SAN type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.2.3.

##### 11.3.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 11.3.2.1.4 Method of test

###### 11.3.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

###### 11.3.2.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[8\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 11.3.2.1.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.2.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the SAN receiver is as specified in clause 11.3.2.1.5.1 and
11.3.2.1.5.2 for SAN type 1-O and SAN type 2-O respectively, and that
the SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 11.3.2.1.4.2-2.

#### 11.3.2.2 ACK missed detection

##### 11.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e., intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

##### 11.3.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For SAN type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.3.

For SAN type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause \[11.3.2.3\].

##### 11.3.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 11.3.2.2.4 Method of test

###### 11.3.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

###### 11.3.2.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[8\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 11.3.2.2.4.2-1.

value at the SAN receiver is as specified in clause 11.3.2.2.5.1 and
11.3.2.2.5.2 for SAN type 1-O and SAN type 2-O respectively, and that
the SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 11.3.2.2.4.2-2.

8\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods. The following statistics are kept:
the number of ACK bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the
number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle
periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK
detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one error for the
statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in
clause 11.3.2.1.4.2 for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are
measured in the same testing.

### 11.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 2

#### 11.3.3.1 ACK missed detection performance requirements

##### 11.3.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 2 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK on the wanted signal.
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e., intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

##### 11.3.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.4.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.3.2.4.

##### 11.3.3.1.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 11.3.3.1.4 Method of test

###### 11.3.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier; M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table.4.6-1).

###### 11.3.3.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[8\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 11.3.3.1.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.2.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the SAN receiver is as specified in clause 11.3.3.1.5.1 and
11.3.3.1.5.2 for *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O* respectively, and
that the SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 11.3.3.1.4.2-2.

#### 11.3.3.2 UCI BLER performance requirements

##### 11.3.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 1 and part 2.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e., intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

##### 11.3.3.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.4.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause \[11.3.2.4\].

##### 11.3.3.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 11.3.3.2.4 Method of test

###### 11.3.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

###### 11.3.3.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branches signals should be transmitted on each polarization
of the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured

### 11.3.4 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

#### 11.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 1 and
part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.3.4.2 Minimum requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.5.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.2.5.

#### 11.3.4.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 11.3.4.4 Method of test

##### 11.3.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference direction* (see D.44 in table
4.6-1).

##### 11.3.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[8\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 11.3.4.4.2-1.

  -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------ ------------------

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.2.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the SAN receiver is as specified in clause 11.3.4.5.1 and
11.3.4.5.2 for *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O* respectively, and the
SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 11.3.4.4.2-2.

### 11.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

#### 11.3.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 1 and
part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[12\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC center, i.e., intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.3.5.2 Minimum requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.6.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.2.6.

#### 11.3.5.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 11.3.5.4 Method of test

##### 11.3.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference direction* (see D.44 in table
4.6-1).

##### 11.3.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[8\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 11.3.4.4.2-1.

  -------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- --------------

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.2.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the SAN receiver is as specified in clause 11.3.5.5.1 and
11.3.5.5.2 for *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O* respectively, and that
the SNR at the SAN receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 11.3.5.4.2-2.

### 11.3.6 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format

#### 11.3.6.1 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1

##### 11.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection

###### 11.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.

###### 11.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.7.

###### 11.3.6.1.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

###### 11.3.6.1.1.4 Method of test

####### 11.3.6.1.1.4.1 Initial conditions

##### 11.3.6.1.2 ACK missed detection

###### 11.3.6.1.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

11.4 OTA performance requirements for PRACH
-------------------------------------------

### 11.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection

#### 11.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is
determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection
of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd).
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.

Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection
of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input
is only noise.

Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble
when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several
error cases -- detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that
was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct
preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value. For AWGN,
NTN-TDLA100-200, and NTN-TDLC5-1200, a timing estimation error occurs if
the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than
the time error tolerance values given in table 11.4.1.1-1.

NTN-TDLC5-1200

The test preambles are listed in table A.4. Which specific test(s) are
applicable to SAN is based on the test applicability rules defined in
clause 11.1.3.

#### 11.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

For *SAN type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.4.1.1 and 11.4.1.2.

For *SAN type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 \[2\]
clause 11.4.2.1 and 11.4.2.2.

#### 11.4.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect PRACH preamble
under static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for
a given SNR.

#### 11.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 11.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.44 in table 4.6-1).

##### 11.4.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
SAN with the test system.

3\) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the
demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of
the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.

7\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel
bandwidth. The power level for the transmission may be set such that the
AWGN level at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 11.4.1.4.2-1.

10\) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries
to detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in
figure 11.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets
as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of
preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed
preambles.

Figure 11.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern

Unless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble
format 0 and 2 is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the
loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the
tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the
timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for
PRACH preamble format 0 and 2 is presented in Figure 11.4.1.4.2-2.

Figure 11.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0

Unless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble
format B4 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop,
by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested
range, which is 0.8us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing
offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble
format B4 and C2 is presented in Figure 11.4.1.4.2-3.

######## Annex B (informative): Environmental requirements for the SAN equipment

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the SAN is to be tested are defined.

For OTA requirements where it is not possible to environmentally control
the entire calibrated OTA chamber either localised control of the SAN
hardware or alternative OTA measurements which are then related to the
original specification are acceptable, see annex B.6.

SAN involves two categories of equipment, differentiated by the
operation environment:

\- Equipment deployed in space as part of Satellite Payload RF (SPRF)

\- Equipment deployed on the ground (SAN terrestrial equipment).

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

B.2.1 Normal test environment for SPRF
--------------------------------------

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the SPRF shall
be tested within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions stated
in table B.2.1-1.

Additional environmental parameters specific to space operation might be
considered and included in test report.

  Other additional parameters                                                                                           As declared by manufacturer in D58.
  NOTE: Space operation conditions are defined outside 3GPP and are depending on characteristics of each application.   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

B.2.2 Normal test environment for SAN terrestrial equipment
-----------------------------------------------------------

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the SAN
terrestrial equipment shall be tested within the minimum and maximum
limits of the conditions stated in table B.2.2-1.

Table B.2.2.-1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment for SAN
terrestrial equipment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

B.3 Void
========

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.

For SPRF this shall use the environment test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment,
conforming to the test procedures specific to space equipment, as
declared by the manufacturer.For SAN terrestrial equipment this shall
use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the
required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the
test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[16\]. Other environmental conditions
shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2. It is allowed to
exclude from this test condition the equipment which is difficult to
include due to size limitations. Such exclusion shall be recorded in the
test report.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Measurement of test environment
===================================

The measurement accuracy of the test environments defined in annex B
shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex C (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test requirements

The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core
specification TS 38.108 \[2\] using the test tolerances (TT) defined
here. When the TT value is zero, the test requirement will be the same
as the minimum requirement. When the TT value is non-zero, the test
requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula
used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.

The TT~OTA~ values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the TT~OTA~ values may sometimes be set to zero.

The TT~OTA~ values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch,
cable loss, etc.).

Note that a formula for applying TT~OTA~ values is provided for all OTA
tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in
the case where the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that
allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error can be
subtracted from the defined TT~OTA~ value in order to generate the
correct tightened test requirements as defined in this annex.

######## Annex F (normative): Void

######## Annex G (normative): Propagation conditions

G.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

G.2.1 Delay profiles
--------------------

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.811 \[17\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.1.1 can be used as such.

\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.811 \[17\].

\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays

\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.2 in TR 38.901 \[11\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple Rayleigh taps are rounded to the same delay bin,
merge them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there is a LOS path in the model, the power for all paths
could be slightly adjusted to keep the RMS delay spread is close to
target delay spread and mean power is 0dB.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest Rayleigh tap to 0 dB when there is
no LOS path in the model.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2, G.2.1.1-3 and
G.2.1.2-2 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### G.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1-NTN

The delay profiles for FR1-NTN are selected to be representative of NLOS
and LOS scenarios. The resulting model parameters are specified in
G.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are specified in tables
G.2.1.1-2 and table G.2.1.1-3.

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex G.2.3 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear arrays at both SAN and UE
and for the antenna configuration using cross polarized antennas.

### G.2.3.1 MIMO correlation matrices using Uniform Linear Array

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex G.2.3.1 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear array (ULA) at both SAN
and UE.

#### G.2.3.1.1 Definition of MIMO correlation matrices

G.3 Moving propagation conditions

Figure G.3-1 illustrate the moving propagation conditions for the test
of the UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the
reference timing and the first tap is according to Equation (G.3-1). The
timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ -
(*T~A~* −31)×16×64*T~c~* for 15kHz SCS and Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×32*T~c~*
for 30kHz SCS. The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The
parameters for the moving propagation conditions are shown in Table

######## Annex H (normative): In-channel Tx test

H.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

H.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a FDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 30 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz
(*N*~RB~ = 273). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

H.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a
sampling rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it
is named $z\left( \upsilon \right)$. The *FFT size* is determined by the
transmission bandwidth in table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table
6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS. In the time
domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a signal with the
following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.5.3.5-3. The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of the *FFT
size* and SCS.

H.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols
are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain.

H.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency error

\- EVM

\- Resource element TX power

\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP)

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

H.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described
in figure H.2.4-1. The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT
and a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1
in figure H.2.4-1. The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT
size* + cyclic prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in
the \"Remove CP\" box. The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are
obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz
SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and
6.5.3.5-4. Table H.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and
the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two
symbols according to the sampling rate.

Table H.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP
length for normal CP

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SCS (kHz)   \# slots in subframe   Symbol \# and slot \# with longer CP   Longer CP length
  ----------- ---------------------- -------------------------------------- ------------------------------
  15          1                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 128
                                     (symbol 7, slot 0)                     

  30          2                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 64
                                     (symbol 0, slot 1)                     

  60          4                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 32
                                     (symbol 0, slot 2)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic
prefix than the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length =
352).

Figure H.2.4-1: Reference point for FR1 EVM measurements

H.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are
varied in order to minimise the difference between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the
amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

Note 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples inbetween the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

Note 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinuish between both.

After this process, the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.

H.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD,
there are $14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs performed where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of
symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2$, and

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2$.

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from tables 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS and
the transmission bandwidth.

The SAN shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended
for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal
shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as
follows, using $z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$:

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$, the timing is
known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is a Dirac peak and
that the correlation between the ideal signal
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and the data in the measured signal is 0.
The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest,
the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.

The number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$. This subset of samples is called
$z'\left( \upsilon \right)$.

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ is determined
according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal
CP, there are two values for $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ in a 1 ms
period:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = length of cylic prefix / 2,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = Longer CP length - length of cylic
prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS, and the longer CP length is obtained from table H.2.4-1.

As per the example values:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = 144 within the CP of length 288 for
OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = 208= 352 - 144) within the CP of
length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.

H.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on $z'\left( \nu \right)$ with the FFT window timing
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$. The result is called
$Z'\left( t,f \right)$. The RE TX power (RETP) is then defined as:

$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$

Where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$$\text{OSTP} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}\sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$

Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
RETP values of all *N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not
containing PDCCH, RS or SSB within a slot.

From the acquired samples, $N_{\text{dl}}$ values for each OSTP can be
obtained and averaged where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval for FDD.

For the example used in the annex, $N_{\text{dl}} = 20$ and
$N_{\text{RB}} = 273$.

H.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform$14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs on $z'\left( \nu \right)$, one for each
OFDM symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing
to produce an array of samples, $14N_{\text{dl}}$ in the time axis *t*
by *FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 280 FFTs are performed on
$z'\left( \nu \right)$. The result is an array of samples, 280 in the
time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$ and
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)\ $are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal $Z'\left( t,f \right)\ $and the post-FFT ideal signal
$I_{2}\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation reference signal, over
10 ms measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex
ratios:

$$a\left( t,f \right)e^{\text{jφ}\left( t,f \right)} = \frac{Z'\left( t,f \right)}{I_{2}\left( t,f \right)}$$

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of 2 \* π when
absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances $t_{i}$ are
greater than or equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

$$a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$$

> and

$$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$$

> Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signals time-domain
> locations $t_{i}$ from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation
> reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ at
the demodulation reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing
the moving average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged
demodulation reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window
size is 19 and averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated
RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when
the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously
allocated RBs is smaller than the moving average window size, the window
size is reduced accordingly as per figure H.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to
compute coefficients$\widetilde{\text{\ a}}\left( f \right)$,
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ for each subcarrier.

H.7 EVM
=======

H.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according
to the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer
coefficients from H.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ (annex H.2.2) and are called
$I\left( t,f \right)$.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

$$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$$

Where:

\- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

\- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource
blocks with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

\- $I\left( t,f \right)$ *is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,

\- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under
test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

H.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
------------------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval. The averaging in the time domain equals the
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slot duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the
equalizer estimation step.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ in the expressions
above and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ in the
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ calculation where (*l* and *h*,
low and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

Thus:

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.
