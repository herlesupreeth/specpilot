 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR Base Station (BS) *type 1-H*, *BS type
1-O* and *BS* *type 2-O*. These have been derived from, and are
consistent with the radiated requirements for *BS type 1-H*, *BS type
1-O* and *BS type 2-O* in BS specification defined in TS 38.104 \[2\].

A *BS type 1-C* only has conducted requirements so it does not require
compliance to this specification.

A *BS type 1-H* has both conducted and radiated requirements so it
requires compliance to the applicable requirements of this specification
and TS 38.141-1 \[3\].

*BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* have only radiated requirements so they
require compliance to this specification only.

===================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in
TS 38.141-2 (the present document), i.e. to all radiated tests defined
in FR1 for *BS type 1-H*, *BS type 1-O* and radiated tests defined in
FR2 for *BS type 2-O*. The frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in
clause 5.1 of TS 38.104 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.104 \[2\]. Test Tolerances
for the radiated test requirements (TT~OTA~) explicitly stated in the
present document are given in annex C.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

The requirements are classified according to spatial characteristics as
shown in table 4.1.1-1 and table 4.1.1-2.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of OTA Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the OTA Test System is specified
below for each radiated test defined explicitly in the present
specification, where appropriate.

The OTA Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case
to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the EUT to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, OTA
measurement methodology description (including calibration and
measurement stage for each test range), MU budget format and its
contributions, refer to TR 37.941 \[29\].

#### 4.1.2.2 Measurement of transmitter

The maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for OTA transmitter tests
minimum requirements are given in tables 4.1.2.2-1 and 4.1.2.2-2.
Details for derivation of OTA Test System uncertainty are given in
corresponding clauses in TR 37.941 \[29\].

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the OTA Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545 \[4\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the OTA Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the OTA Test System uncertainty shall be, for
each OTA measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of this specification.

If the OTA Test System for an OTA test is known to have a measurement
uncertainty greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still
permitted to use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as
follows:

Any additional uncertainty in the OTA Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the OTA test
requirement, making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g.
receiver tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals. This
procedure will ensure that an OTA Test System not compliant with
clause 4.1.2 does not increase the chance of passing a EUT where that
device would otherwise have failed the test if an OTA Test System
compliant with clause 4.1.2 had been used.

Radiated characteristics for *BS type 1-H*, *BS type 1-O* and *BS type
2-O* are defined over the air (OTA) where the operating band specific
radiated interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary*
(RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements.
The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement. For *BS type 1-H* the requirements are
defined for two points of reference, signified by radiated requirements
at the RIB and the conducted requirements at *transceiver array
boundary* (TAB). The OTA requirements of *BS type 1-H* are tested in the
far field (Fraunhofer) region.

General architecture and reference points of *BS type 1-H*, *BS type
1-O* and *BS type 2-O* are presented on the following figures 4.2-1 --
4.2-2.

This specification details only radiated test requirements and hence
only requires the radiated reference points.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
receive/send parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a *radio distribution network* (RDN) and
an antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network that distributes
the RF power between the *transceiver array boundary* and the antenna
array, in an implementation specific way.

4.3 Base station classes
------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated. The associated deployment scenarios and definitions of BS
classes are exactly the same for BS with and without connectors.

BS classes for *BS type 1-H* are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
70 dB.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals
to 53 dB.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
45 dB.

BS classes for BS *type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* are defined as indicated
below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m.

For BS *type 1-H and 1-O,* HAPS BS class is defined as indicated below:

\- HAPS Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
High Altitude Platform scenarios with a BS to ground UE minimum distance
of typically around 20km.

\- Unless otherwise stated, HAPS BS class would refer to Wide Area BS
class, which is specified in clause 4.3.

For *BS type* *1-H* and *1-O,* ATG BS class is defined as indicated
below:

\- ATG Base Stations are characterized by requirements derived from ATG
scenarios with a ground BS to air UE with typical vertical altitude of
around 10,000m and take-off/landing altitudes down to 3000m.

\- Unless otherwise stated, ATG BS class would refer to Wide Area BS
class, which is specified in clause 4.3.

The manufacturer shall declare the intended class of the BS under test.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

#### 4.7.2.2 NRTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of test configuration NRTC1 is to test all BS requirements
excluding CA occupied bandwidth.

For NRTC1 used in receiver tests only the two outermost carriers within
each supported operating band need to be generated by the test
equipment.

##### 4.7.2.2.1 NRTC1 generation

NRTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- The *Base Station RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band
shall be the declared maximum radiated *Base Station RF Bandwidth* for
contiguous operation (D.17).

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2.1 and place it
adjacent to the lower *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*. Place same
signal adjacent to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- For transmitter tests, select as many carriers (according to 4.7.2.1)
that the beam supports within a band and that fit in the rest of the
declared maximum *Base Station RF Bandwidth*. Place the carriers
adjacent to each other starting from the upper *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge*. The nominal carrier spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 5.4.1 shall apply;

The test configuration should be constructed on a per band basis for all
component carriers of the inter-band CA bands declared to be supported
by the beam (D.60). All configured component carriers are transmitted
simultaneously in the tests where the transmitter should be on.

##### 4.7.2.2.2 NRTC1 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the number of carriers at maximum TRP
(D.15).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,t,TRP~ (D.38).

*For a beam declared to support CA-only operation (D.20), s*et the power
spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of
the carrier power equals the same value as above.

#### 4.7.2.3 NRTC2: Contiguous CA occupied bandwidth

NRTC2 in this clause is used to test CA occupied bandwidth.

##### 4.7.2.3.1 NRTC2 generation

NRTC2 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Of all component carrier combinations supported by the beam, those
which have smallest or largest sum of channel bandwidths of **component
carrier**, shall be tested. Of all component carrier combinations which
have smallest or largest sum of channel bandwidth of component carriers
supported by the BS, only one combination having largest sum and one
combination having smallest sum shall be tested irrespective of the
number of component carriers.

\- Of all **component carrier** combinations which have same sum of
channel bandwidths of **component carrier**, select those with the
narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing
declared per *operating band* (D.7) at the lower *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge*.

\- Of the combinations selected in the previous step, select one with
the narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing
declared per *operating band* (D.7) at the upper *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge*.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the smallest number of **component carrier**.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing declared per *operating band* (D.7) being adjacent to the lowest
carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing declared per *operating band* (D.7) being adjacent to the
highest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing declared per *operating band* (D.7) being adjacent to the
carrier which has been selected in the previous step.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, repeat
the previous step until there is only one combination left.

\- The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

##### 4.7.2.3.2 NRTC2 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the number of carriers at maximum TRP
(D.15).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

*S*et the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so
that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter TRP
P~rated,t,TRP~ (D.38).

#### 4.7.2.4 NRTC3: Non-contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of NRTC3 is to test NR multicarrier non-contiguous aspects.

For NRTC3 used in receiver tests, outermost carriers for each sub-block
need to be generated by the test equipment; other supported carriers are
optional to be generated.

##### 4.7.2.4.1 NRTC3 generation

NRTC3 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The *Base Station RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band
shall be the declared maximum radiated *Base Station RF Bandwidth* for
non-contiguous operation (D.17). The *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
consists of one sub-block gap and two sub-blocks located at the edges of
the declared maximum radiated *Base Station RF Bandwidth* for
non-contiguous operation (D.17).

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2.1. Place it
adjacent to the upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* and another
similar carrier adjacent to the lower *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- For single-band operation receiver tests, if the remaining gap is at
least 15 MHz (or 60 MHz if channel bandwidth of the carrier to be tested
is 20 MHz) for FR1 or 150 MHz for FR2 plus two times the *channel
bandwidth* used in the previous step and the beam supports at least 4
carriers, place a NR carrier of this *channel bandwidth* adjacent to
each already placed carrier for each sub-block. The nominal channel
spacing defined in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 5.4.1 shall apply.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

##### 4.7.2.4.2 NRTC3 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the number of carriers at maximum TRP
(D.15).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,\ t,TRP~ (D.38).

#### 4.7.2.5 NRTC4: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

The purpose of NRTC4 is to test beams which have been generated using
transceiver units supporting operation in multiple operating bands
through common active RF components, considering maximum supported
number of carriers.

##### 4.7.2.5.1 NRTC4 generation

NRTC4 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable
per band on beams generated using Multi-band transceiver units and hence
have declared multi-band dependencies (D.16). It is constructed using
the following method:

\- The *Base Station RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band
shall be the declared maximum radiated *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
(D.17).

\- The number of carriers of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum number of supported carriers per *operating band* in
multi-band operation (D.21). Carriers shall be selected according to
4.7.2.1 and shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum radiated *Radio Bandwidth* (D.18). Additional carriers shall
next be placed at the edges of *Base Station RF Bandwidth*, if possible.

\- The allocated *Base Station RF Bandwidth* of the outermost bands
shall be located at the outermost edges of the declared maximum radiated
*Radio Bandwidth* (D.18).

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to NRTC1 where the
declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. The mirror
image of the single band test configuration shall be used in the highest
band being tested for the beam.

\- If an operating band with multi-band dependencies supports three
carriers only, two carriers shall be placed in one band according to the
relevant test configuration while the remaining carrier shall be placed
at the edge of the maximum *Radio Bandwidth* in the other band.

\- If the sum of the maximum *base station RF bandwidths* of each of the
supported operating bands is greater than the declared *total RF
bandwidth* BW~tot~ (D.19) of transmitter and receiver for the declared
band combinations of the BS, then repeat the steps above for test
configurations where the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* of one of the
operating band shall be reduced so that the declared *total RF
bandwidth* is not exceeded and vice versa.

\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carriers per *operating
band* in multi-band operation (D.21) is larger than the declared total
maximum number of supported carriers in multi-band operation (D.63),
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall
be reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not be
exceeded and vice versa.

##### 4.7.2.5.2 NRTC4 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the total maximum number of supported
carriers in multi-band operation (D.63).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,\ t,TRP~ (D.38).

If the allocated number of carriers in an operating band exceeds the
declared number of carriers at maximum TRP in an operating band (D.15)
the carriers should if possible be allocated to a different operating
band.

#### 4.7.2.6 NRTC5: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier

The purpose of NRTC5 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
higher PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and non-contiguous
operation (if supported) in multi-band mode.

##### 4.7.2.6.1 NRTC5 generation

NRTC5 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable
for operating bands using multi-band transceiver units and hence have
declared multi-band dependencies (D.16)*.* It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The *Base Station RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band
shall be the declared maximum radiated *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
(D.17).

\- The allocated *Radio Bandwidth* of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared maximum *Radio Bandwidth*
of the operating band with multi-band dependencies (D.18).

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall be selected according to 4.7.2.1 and shall be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared maximum *Radio Bandwidth* of the
operating band with multi-band dependencies (D.18).

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to NRTC3, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest
supported *BS channel bandwidth* with the smallest subcarrier spacing
declared per *operating band* (D.7) shall be used in the test
configuration.

\- If an *operating band* with multi-band dependencies supports three
carriers only, two carriers shall be placed in one band according to the
relevant test configuration while the remaining carrier shall be placed
at the edge of the maximum *Radio Bandwidth* in the other band.

\- If the sum of the maximum *base station RF bandwidths* of each of the
supported *operating bands* is greater than the declared *total RF
bandwidth* BW~tot~ (D.19) of transmitter and receiver for the declared
band combinations of the BS, then repeat the steps above for test
configurations where the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* of one of the
*operating band* shall be reduced so that the declared *total RF
bandwidth* BW~tot~ of the *operating band* with multi-band dependencies
(D.18) is not exceeded and vice versa.

##### 4.7.2.6.2 NRTC5 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the total maximum number of supported
carriers in multi-band operation (D.63).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,\ t,TRP~ (D.38).

If the sum of the TRP for all carriers in an operating band(s) exceeds
the sum of the rated carrier TRP output power P~rated,c,TRP~ (D.37) for
the number of carriers at maximum TRP (D.15) in multi-band operation,
the exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other
band(s). If the TRP allocated for a carrier exceeds the declared rated
carrier OTA BS power, P~rated,c,TRP~, the exceeded power shall, if
possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single carrier testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the BS. These are denoted as RF channels B
(bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~
(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum *Base Station RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum *Base Station RF Bandwidth* located in the middle of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum *Base Station RF Bandwidth* located at the top of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation and capable of dual-band
operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at
B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_ T\'~RFBW~: the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and
at the highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
maximum *Radio Bandwidth*, in the upper operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~: the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at
the lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum
*Radio Bandwidth*, in the lower operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared maximum *Radio Bandwidth* (see clause 4.6) spans both
operating bands. B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *Base Station RF Bandwidths*
are located at the bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower
operating band and at the top of the supported frequency range in the
upper operating band.

Occupied bandwidth test in this TS are performed with the *aggregated BS
channel bandwidth* and sub-block bandwidths located at the bottom,
middle and top of the supported frequency range in the operating band.
These are denoted as B~BW\ Channel\ CA~(bottom), M~BW\ Channel\ CA~
(middle) and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ (top) for contiguous spectrum operation.

Unless otherwise stated, the test for contiguous spectrum operation
shall be performed at B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and
T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ defined as following:

\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- M~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located close
in the middle of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- T~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in each operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation, B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~
for contiguous spectrum operation in the operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating
band combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory
may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

### 4.9.2 Test models

#### 4.9.2.1 General

The following clauses will describe the NR test models needed for *BS
type* *2-O*. Note the NR FR1 test models described in TS 38.141-1 \[3\]
are also applicable for *BS type 1-O* conformance testing.

#### 4.9.2.2 NR FR2 test models

The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according
to one of the NR test models (NR- FR2-TM) below. A reference to the
applicable test model is made within each test.

The following general parameters are used by all NR test models:

\- For FR2-1, duration is 2 radio frames for TDD (20 ms). For FR2-2,
duration is twice of 80 slots in time length (160 slots time length).

\- The slots are numbered 0 to 10×2^µ^ -- 1 where µ is the numerology
corresponding to the subcarrier spacing

\- N~RB~ is the maximum transmission bandwidth configuration seen in
table 5.3.2-2 and table 5.3.2-3 in TS 38.104 \[2\].

\- Normal CP

\- Virtual resource blocks of localized type

For NR FR2 TDD, test models are derived based on the uplink/downlink
configuration as shown in the table 4.9.2.2-1 using information element
*TDD-UL-DL-ConfigCommon* as defined in TS 38.331 \[22\].

prior to modulation and mapping to the RE grid.

Initialization of the scrambler and RE-mappers as defined in
TS 38.211 \[20\] use the following additional parameters:

\- $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 1$ for the lowest configured carrier,
$N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = 2$ for the 2^nd^ lowest configured
carrier, ... $N_{\text{ID}}^{\text{cell}} = n$ for the n^th^ configured
carrier

\- Antenna ports starting with 2000 for PDCCH

\- For NR-FR2-TM1.1 when used for TAE requirement of two-layers MIMO
transmission

\- Rank 2, two layers, no precoding

\- Antenna ports starting with 1000 and 1001 for PDSCH

Otherwise

\- Rank 1, single layer

\- Antenna port starting with 1000 for PDSCH

##### 4.9.2.3.1 PDCCH

\- $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{CORESET}} = \ 2$

\- PDCCH modulation to be QPSK as described in TS 38.211 \[20\],
clause 5.1.3.

\- For each slot the required amount of bits for all PDCCHs is as
follows: 1(\# of PDCCH) \* 1(\# of CCE per PDCCH) \* 6(REG per CCE) \*
9(data RE per REG) \* 2(bits per RE) with these parameters according to
the NR-FR2-TM definitions in clause 4.4.9.2.2.

\- Generate this amount of bits from the output of the PN23 sequence
generator \[28\]. For FR2-1, the PN sequence generator is initialized
with a starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each
frame. The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries. For
FR2-2, the PN sequence generator is initialized with a starting seed of
\"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each 80 slots time period of
test model length, identical payload data sequence repeated in following
80 slot. The PN sequence is continuous over the slot boundaries.

\- 1 CCE shall be according to TS 38.211 \[20\], clause 7.3.2. PDCCH
using non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping. PDCCH occupies the first two
symbols for 6 resource-element groups, where a resource element group
equals one resource block during one OFDM symbol.

##### 4.9.2.3.2 PDSCH

\- Generate the required amount of bits from the output of the PN23
sequence generator \[28\]. For FR2-1, the PN sequence generator is
initialized with a starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated
slot of each frame. For FR2-2, the PN sequence generator is initialized
with a starting seed of \"all ones\" in the first allocated slot of each
80 slots time period of test model length, identical payload data
sequence repeated in following 80 slot. The PN sequence is continuous
over the slot boundaries. For TDD TMs, the PN sequence can be generated
for all symbols (in the DL, UL or special slots) or only DL symbols (in
the DL or special slots). For TMs with multi-users, the PN sequence can
be generated per user ($n_{\text{RNTI}}$).

\- NR-FR2-TMs utilize 1 or 2 user PDSCH transmissions distinguished by
$n_{\text{RNTI}}$. For each NR-FR2-TM, PRBs are mapped to user

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum
operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply
both at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edges and inside the sub-block
gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges
respectively.

There are no CA requirements for ATG BS in the present specification.

4.11 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
--------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band* *RIB*, the radiated test requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply separately to each supported *operating band*, unless otherwise
stated. For some radiated test requirements, it is explicitly stated
that specific additions or exclusions to the test requirement apply at
*multi-band RIB(s)* as detailed in the requirement clause.

*BS type 1-O* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations at the
*radiated interface boundary*:

\- All RIBs are single-band RIBs.

\- All RIBs are *multi-band* *RIBs*.

\- A combination of single-band *RIBs* and *multi-band RIBs* provides
support of the *BS type 1-O* capability of operation in multiple
*operating bands*.

For *multi-band RIBs* supporting the bands for TDD, the radiated test
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur between the bands.

NOTE: The radiated test requirements for *multi-band RIBs* supporting
bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release of
this specification.

There is no multi-band operation requirement for ATG BS.

4.12 Co-location requirements
-----------------------------

### 4.12.1 General

Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming
the *BS type 1-O* is co-located with another BS of the same base station
class. They ensure that both co-located systems can operate with minimal
degradation to each other.

The co-location requirements in table 4.12.1-1 rely on a *co-location
reference antenna* used to mimic a base station to base station
co-location scenario.

The OTA transmit ON/OFF power requirement and OTA transmitter
intermodulation requirement are mandatory requirements where the test
requirement is derived using the *co-location reference antenna*, which
represents the worst-case scenario.

The *co-location reference antenna* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\].

### 4.12.2 Co-location test antenna

#### 4.12.2.1 General

Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of
the conducted interface of the *co-location reference antenna*. For
conformance testing the requirements are translated to the input or
output of a *co-location test antenna* (CLTA).

A CLTA is a practical antenna which can be used to test conformance to
the co-location requirements.

#### 4.12.2.2 Co-location test antenna characteristics

A *co-location test antenna* is a practical passive antenna that is used
for conformance testing of the co-location requirements and is based on
the definition of the *co-location reference antenna*. A CLTA shall
comply with the requirements specified in table 4.12.2.2-1.

Translation of the requirements to other test antennas are not precluded
but suitable translations between the co-location reference antenna and
test antenna must be provided to demonstrate that the method is within
the specified MU.

NOTE: The currently defined CLTAs are suitable for testing *BS type 1-O*
implemented with a planar antenna array. The method for testing BS with
other antenna array implementations is not covered by the present
release of this specification.

4.13 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

X Title

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

X.1 Definition and applicability

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

X.2 Minimum requirement

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.

X.3 Test purpose

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

X.4 Method of test

X.4.1 General

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

X.4.2y First test method

X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up. The OTA Test System is assumed to be correctly calibrated as
part of the initial conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.

X.4.2y.2 Procedure

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like domain (e.g.
frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms
(e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g.
average result from several measurement positions).

X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

X.5 Test requirement

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 (Interpretation of measurement results). Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

4.14 Reference coordinate system
--------------------------------

Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic
characteristics (e.g. EIRP and EIS) at certain angles with respect to
the base station. To be able to declare radiated characteristics part of
radiated requirements a reference coordinate system is required. The
reference coordinate system is should be associated to an identifiable
physical feature on the base station enclosure. The location of the
origin and the orientation of the reference coordinate system are for
the base station manufacturer to declare.

The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate
system with rectangular axis (x***,*** y***,*** z) and spherical angles
(θ, φ) as showed in figure 4.14-1.

![](./media/image16.emf){width="3.933333333333333in"
height="4.066666666666666in"}

Figure 4.14-1: Reference coordinate system

φ*** ***is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the
projection of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined
between -180° and +180°, inclusive. θ*** *** is the angle between the
projection of the vector in the x***/***y plane and the radiating vector
and is defined between -90° and +90°, inclusive. Note that θ is defined
as positive along the down-tilt angle.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the NR operating bands specification, their channel bandwidth
configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as synchronization
raster specification, refer to TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5 and its
relevant clauses.

For radiated testing purposes in this specification, FR1 and FR2
operating bands are considered.

For ATG BS, their operating bands refer to TS 38.104.

6 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

6.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.

If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.13, D.14), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.

6.2 Radiated transmit power
---------------------------

### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability

Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam
at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each declared beam, the requirement is based on declarations
captured in clause 4.6 for a beam identifier (D.3), *reference beam
direction pair* (D.8), *rated beam EIRP* (D.11) at the beam\'s reference
direction pair, *OTA peak directions set* (D.9), the *beam direction
pairs* at the maximum steering directions (D.10) and their associated
*rated beam EIRP* and *beamwidth(s)* for reference *beam direction pair*
and maximum steering directions (D.12).

For a declared beam identifier and *beam direction pair*, the *rated
beam EIRP* level is the maximum power that the BS is declared to radiate
at the associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter ON
period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in clause 6.2.4.1.

NOTE 1: The *OTA peak directions set* for a beam is the complete
continuous or discrete set of all *beam direction* for which the EIRP
accuracy is intended to be achieved for the beam.

NOTE 2: A beam direction pair consists of a beam centre direction and an
associated beam peak direction.

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *operating bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW)
is larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by
manufacturer:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier
EIRP is:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

Radiated transmit power is directional requirement applicable to BS type
1-H, BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O.

For BS Type 1-H, for operation with shared spectrum channel access
operation, the BS may have to comply with the applicable BS power limits
established regionally, when deployed in regions where those limits
apply and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.

*For BS type 1-H* there is no requirement specified for band n46, n100,
n101 and n102.

*For BS type 1-O* there is no requirement specified for bands n46, n96,
n100, n101 and n102.

### 6.2.2 Minimum requirement

Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for *BS type 1-H* and *BS
type 1-O* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.2.2.

Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is defined
in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.2.3.

### 6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability to accurately generate and
direct radiated power per beam, across the frequency range and under
normal conditions, for all declared beams of the *BS type 1-H*, *BS type
1-O* and *BS type 2-O*.

### 6.2.4 Method of test

#### 6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environments:

\- Normal, see annex B.2.

\- Extreme (*BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* only), see annexes B.3 and
B.5.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*Base station RF bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1,

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA peak directions set reference beam direction pair (D.8), and

\- OTA peak directions set maximum steering directions (D.10).

Beams to be tested:

\- The *beam* with the highest *rated beam EIRP* (D.11), or

\- The beams with highest rated beam EIRP, Prated,c,FBWlow (D.57) and
Prated,c,FBWhigh (D.58), if these are provided.

Under extreme test environment, for the *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*
it is sufficient to test on one NR-ARFCN or one RF bandwidth position,
and with one applicable test configuration defined in clauses 4.7 and
4.8. Direction to be tested is only at *OTA peak directions set
reference beam direction pair* (D.8). Testing shall be performed under
extreme power supply conditions, as defined in annex B.5.

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.

#### 6.2.4.2 Procedure

For normal test environment conditions in OTA domain, the test procedure
is as follows:

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna.

4\) Configure the *beam peak direction* of the BS according to the
declared *beam direction pair*.

5\) Set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in
clause 4.9.2.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation use
the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s)
in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

6\) Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and
p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

6.3 OTA base station output power
---------------------------------

### 6.3.1 Definition and applicability

power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB during the *transmitter ON
period*.

The BS *rated carrier TRP* for *BS type 1-O* shall be within limits as
specified in table 6.3.1-1.

Table 6.3.1-1: BS rated carrier TRP limits for *BS type 1-O*

  BS class                                                                                  P~rated,c,TRP~
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------
  Wide Area BS                                                                              (note)
  Medium Range BS                                                                           ≤ + 47 dBm
  Local Area BS                                                                             ≤ + 33 dBm
  NOTE: There is no upper limit for the **P~rated,c,TRP~** of the Wide Area Base Station.   

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the rated output power,
P~rated,c,TRP~, declared by the manufacturer shall be equal to or less
than 20 W per 10 MHz bandwidth.

There is no upper limit for the *rated carrier TRP* of *BS type 2-O*.

Despite the general requirements for the BS output power described in
TS 38.104 \[2\] clauses 9.3.2 -- 9.3.3, additional regional requirements
might be applicable.

NOTE: In certain regions, power limits corresponding to BS classes may
apply for *BS type 2-O*.

### 6.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.3.3.

### 6.3.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the accuracy of the *maximum carrier TRP*
(P~max,c,TRP~) across the frequency range for all *RIBs*.

### 6.3.4 Method of test

#### 6.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M, T; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Beams to be tested:

As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise
the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I).

#### 6.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 5, and 7. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[29\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) Configure the BS such that the beam peak direction(s) applied during
the power measurement step 6 are consistent with the grid and
measurement approach for the TRP test.

4\) Set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in
clause 4.9.2.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation use
the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s)
in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

5\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex I).

6\) Measure the radiated power for any two orthogonal polarizations
(denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for
particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.

If the test chamber is a reverberation chamber measure TRP directly.

7\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).

8\) Calculate TRP using the EIRP measurements.

For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 6.3.5 Test requirement

#### 6.3.5.1 *BS type 1-O*

The final TRP measurement result in clause 6.3.4.2 shall remain:

\- within +5.1 dB and -5.1 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared *rated
carrier TRP* P~rated,c,TRP~ carrier frequency 24.25 GHz \< f ≤ 29.5 GHz.

\- within +5.4 dB and --5.4 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared *rated
carrier TRP* P~rated,c,TRP~ for carrier frequency 37 GHz \< f ≤ 43.5
GHz.

\- within +5.6 dB and --5.6 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared *rated
carrier TRP* P~rated,c,TRP~ for carrier frequency 43.5 GHz \< f ≤ 48.2
GHz.

\- within +6.2 dB and --6.2 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared *rated
carrier TRP* P~rated,c,TRP~ for carrier frequency 52.6 GHz ≤ f ≤ 71 GHz.

-----------------------------

### 6.4.1 General

The requirements in clause 6.4 apply during the *transmitter ON period*.
Transmit signal quality (as specified in clause 6.6) shall be maintained
for the output power dynamics requirements.

The OTA output power requirements are single direction requirements and
apply to the beam peak directions over the OTA peak directions set.

### 6.4.2 OTA RE power control dynamic range

(P~max,c,EIRP~) for a specified reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

#### 6.4.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.4.2.2.

#### 6.4.2.3 Method of test

dynamic range. The Error Vector Magnitude test, as described in
clause 6.6 provides sufficient test coverage for this requirement.

### 6.4.3 OTA total power dynamic range

#### 6.4.3.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum
and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

NOTE: The upper limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the BS
maximum carrier EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) when transmitting on all RBs. The
lower limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the average EIRP for
single RB transmission in the same direction using the same beam. The
OFDM symbols shall carry PDSCH and not contain PDCCH, RS or SSB.

#### 6.4.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.4.3.2.

#### 6.5.1.1 Definition and applicability

OTA transmitter OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of NR
BS.

OTA transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over
70/N µs filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the BS (BW~Config~) centred on
the assigned channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF period*. N =
SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

For BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power is
defined as the mean power measured over 70/N µs filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth*
**BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2 during the
*transmitter OFF period*.** N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the *aggregated BS channel
bandwidth*.

For *BS type 1-O*, the transmitter OFF power is defined as the output
power at the *co-location test antenna* conducted output(s). For *BS
type 2-O* the transmitter OFF power is defined as TRP.

For *multi-band* *RIBs* or *single band RIBs* supporting transmission in
multiple bands, the requirement is only applicable during the
*transmitter OFF period* in all supported *operating bands*.

  NOTE: These percentages are informative and apply to all OFDM symbols within subframe except for symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 2. Symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 2 may have a longer CP and therefore a lower percentage.

##### 6.6.3.5.2 *BS type 2-O*

For *BS type 2-O*, the EVM of each NR carrier for different modulation
schemes on PDSCH shall be less than the limits in table 6.6.3.5.2-1 for
FR2-1 and table 6.6.3.5.2-1a for FR2-2.

  64QAM                         \[9.0\]

EVM requirements shall apply for each NR carrier over all allocated
resource blocks and downlink slots. PT-RS should be configured for
localized setting for every fourth symbol for every second RB. Different
modulation schemes listed in table 6.6.3.5.2-1 and table 6.6.3.5.2-1a
shall be considered for rank 1.

For FR2-1, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed
for each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink
slots within 10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM
measurement periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

For FR2-2, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed
for each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink
slots within 80 slots measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM
measurement periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

Table 6.6.3.5.2-2, 6.6.3.5.2-3, 6.6.3.5.2-4, and 6.6.3.5.2-5 below
specify the EVM window length (*W*) for normal CP for *BS type 2-O*.

### 6.6.4 OTA time alignment error

#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability

This requirement shall apply to frame timing in MIMO transmission,
carrier aggregation and their combinations.

Frames of the NR signals present in the radiated domain are not
perfectly aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF signals
present in the radiated domain may experience certain timing
differences.

For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission
mode, the OTA Time Alignment Error (OTA TAE) is defined as the largest
timing difference between any two different NR signals. The OTA time
alignment error requirement is defined as a *directional requirement* at
the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range.*

#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.6.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.6.3.3.

#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose

To verify that the OTA time alignment error is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA coverage range reference direction (D.35).

Polarizations to be tested: For dual polarized systems the requirement
shall be tested and met considering both polarisations. If the
measurement antenna does not support dual polarization, time alignment
error shall be measured under the condition that measurement antenna is
aligned between the BS polarisations such that it receives half the
power from each polarisation.

##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna.

4\) Configure the beamforming settings of the BS according to the
direction of the testing.

5\) Set the *BS type 1-O* to transmit NR-FR1-TM1.1 or any DL signal
using MIMO transmission or carrier aggregation, using the configuration
with the minimum number of cells and reference signals.

Set the *BS type 2-O* to transmit NR-FR2-TM 1.1 or any DL signal using
MIMO transmission or carrier aggregation, using the configuration with
the minimum number of cells and reference signals.

NOTE: For MIMO transmission, different ports may be configured in
NR-FR1-TM1.1 and NR-FR2-TM 1.1 (using DMRS ports *p* = 1000 and 1001
with CDM).

For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the BS to transmit according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model at manufacturer\'s
declared rated output power, P~rated,c,TRP~.

If the BS supports intra band contiguous or non-contiguous Carrier
Aggregation set the BS to transmit using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7.2
and 4.8.

If the BS supports inter band carrier aggregation set the BS to
transmit, for each band, a single carrier or all carriers, using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8.

For *BS type 1-O* declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set
the BS to transmit according to the applicable test signal configuration
and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using
the corresponding test model on all carriers configured.

For *BS type 2-O* declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set
the BS to transmit according to the applicable test signal configuration
and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using
the corresponding test model on all carriers configured.

6\) Measure the time alignment error between the different reference
symbols on different beams on the carrier(s).

In addition, for a multi-band RIB, the following steps shall apply:

7\) For a multi-band RIB and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.6.4.5 Test Requirement

##### 6.6.4.5.1 *BS type 1-O*

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, OTA TAE shall not
exceed 90 ns.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO, OTA
TAE shall not exceed 285 ns.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO,
OTA TAE shall not exceed 3.025 µs.

For inter-band carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO, OTA TAE shall
not exceed 3.025 µs.

The TAE requirement does not apply to ATG BS.

##### 6.6.4.5.2 *BS type 2-O*

The minimum requirement for TAE is given in Table 6.6.4.5.2-1.

6.7 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 6.7.1 General

OTA unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[5\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *BS channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *BS type 1-O* and *BS
type 2-O* transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel
Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE).
The OTA Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted emissions
in each supported downlink operating band plus the frequency ranges
Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band. OTA Unwanted emissions
outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious emissions
requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the operating band edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
table 6.7.1-1 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* for the NR operating
bands.

Table 6.7.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink operating
band

  BS type       Operating band characteristics                  Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------- ----------------
  BS type 1-O   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                100 MHz ≤ F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
                n104                                            100
  BS type 2-O   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 4000 MHz            1500
                4000 \< F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 14000 MHz     3500

The OTA unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* or co-location requirements as
described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for OTA occupied bandwidth.

### 6.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 6.7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[13\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The OTA occupied bandwidth requirement applies during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 6.7.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* is in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.7.2.2.

#### 6.7.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *RIB* does not
occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is,
therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the
spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 6.7.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA coverage range reference direction (D.35).

Beams to be tested: Declared beam with the highest intended EIRP for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWθ, or for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWϕ (D.3, D.11).

*Aggregated BS channel bandwidth* positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~; see clause 4.9.1.

For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation, start
transmission according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model NR-FR1-TM1.1 for *BS type
1-O* or NR-FR2-TM1.1 for *BS type 2-O* in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers
declared rated carrier EIRP (P~rated,c,EIRP~, D.11).

For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous carrier aggregation
operation, set the base station to transmit according to NR-FR1-TM1.1
for *BS type 1-O* or NR-FR2-TM1.1 for *BS type 2-O* in clause 4.9.2 on
all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7.2.3.1 and 4.8.

##### 6.7.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna..

4\) Configure the beam peak direction of the BS according to the
declared beam direction pair.

5\) Set the BS to transmit signal.

6\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in
table 6.7.2.4.2-1, table 6.7.2.4.2-2, and table 6.7.2.4.2-3. The
selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30
kHz or less.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode is power responding. There are at least two ways to be power
responding. The spectrum analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection,
with its video bandwidth setting at least three times its RBW setting.
Or the analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.

#### 6.7.2.5 Test requirement

##### 6.7.2.5.1 *BS type 1-O*

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
channel bandwidth as defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], table 5.3.5-1. For
contiguous CA, t**he occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to
the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* as defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 5.3A**.

##### 6.7.2.5.2 *BS type 2-O*

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
channel bandwidth as defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], table 5.3.5-2. For
contiguous CA, t**he occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to
the *aggregated BS channel bandwidth* as defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 5.3A**.

### 6.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.7.3.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

For both *BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O*, for a *RIB* operating in
multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the OTA ACLR requirements in
clause 6.7.3.2 apply to *BS channel bandwidths* of the outermost
carrier.

For *BS type 1-O,* for a *RIB* operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the
OTA ACLR requirements in clause 6.7.3.2 shall apply inside sub-block
gaps for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.7.3.5.1-2a, while the
CACLR requirement in clause 6.7.3.2 shall apply in *sub block gaps* for
the frequency ranges defined in table 6.7.3.5.1-3. In addition, for a
*multi-band RIB*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.7.3.2 shall apply in
*Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.7.3.5.1-2a, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.7.3.2 shall apply
in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.7.3.5.1-3.

For *BS type 2-O,* for a *RIB* operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the
OTA ACLR requirements in clause 6.7.3.2 shall apply inside any sub-block
gap for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.7.3.5.2-3, while the
CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub block gaps* for
the frequency ranges defined in table 6.7.3.5.2-3.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
period*.

#### 6.7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.7.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.7.3.3.

#### 6.7.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the OTA adjacent channel leakage ratio requirement shall
be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.7.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B and T; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operaton, see
clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I).

##### 6.7.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annexI. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. When
calibrated and operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[29\] the
measurement methods are applicable and selected depending on
availability at the test facility.

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.3.5.

detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1 for FR1 and Table 4.1.2.2-2 for FR2.

4\) For single carrier operation, set the BS to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier
output power* (P~rated,c,TRP~).

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation use
the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s)
in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

5\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex I).

6\) Measure the absolute power of the assigned channel frequency and the
(adjacent channel frequency).

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex I).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the
wanted channel and the adjacent channel using the measurements made in
Step 7.

9\) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.

NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the
assigned channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent
frequency channel.

NOTE 2: For FR1 the measurement uncertainty of the reverberation chamber
for the relative ACLR is higher than the measurement uncertainty in
clause 4.1.2 the test requirements in table 6.7.3.5.1-1 shall be
tightened following the procedure in clause 4.1.3.

10\) Measure OTA ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel
frequency as specified in table 6.7.3.5.1-1 for *BS type 1-O* or table
6.7.3.5.2-1for *BS type 2-O* respectively. In multiple carrier case only
offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.

11\) For the OTA ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for
non-contiguous spectrum operation or inside *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for
multi-band operation:

a\) Measure OTA ACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*,
if applicable.

b\) Measure OTA CACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*,
if applicable.

12\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up using NR- FR1-TM1.2 defined
in clause 4.9.2 in TS 38.141-1 \[3\] for *BS type 1-O*.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

13\) For *BS type 1-O* and *multi-band RIB* and single band tests,
repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other band.

#### 6.7.3.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.3.5.1 *BS type 1-O*

For the OTA ACLR requirement either the OTA ACLR limits in tables
6.7.3.5.1-1/2a or the OTA ACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.1-2
shall apply, whichever is less stringent. The OTA CACLR limits in table
6.7.3.5.1-3 or the OTA CACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.1-3a shall
apply, whichever is less stringent.

The CACLR in a sub-block gap and Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.7.3.5.1-3 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.7.3.5.1-4.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the OTA ACLR measurement
result shall not be less than the OTA ACLR limit specified in table
6.7.3.5.1-1.

##### 6.7.3.5.2 *BS type 2-O*

For the OTA ACLR requirement either the OTA ACLR limits in tables
6.7.3.5.2-1/3 or the OTA ACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.2-2 shall
apply, whichever is less stringent. The OTA CACLR limits in table
6.7.3.5.2-4 or the OTA CACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.2-4a shall
apply, whichever is less stringent.

The CACLR in a sub-block gap is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.7.3.5.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.7.3.5.2-5.

The OTA ACLR measurement result shall not be less than the OTA ACLR
limit specified in table 6.7.3.5.2-1.

### 6.7.4 OTA operating band unwanted emissions 

#### 6.7.4.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as
TRP per RIB, unless otherwise stated.

For *BS type 1-O*, for a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous
CA, the requirements apply to *BS channel bandwidths* of the outermost
carrier. In addition, for a *RIB* operating in non-contiguous spectrum,
the requirements shall apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for
a *multi-band RIB*, the requirements shall apply inside any Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

For *BS type 2-O*, for a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous
CA, the requirements apply to the frequencies starting from the edge of
the *contiguous transmission bandwidth.* In addition, for a *RIB*
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements apply inside any
sub-block gap.

#### 6.7.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.7.4.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.7.4.3.

#### 6.7.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the BS, close to the assigned
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the BS is in operation.

#### 6.7.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I).

##### 6.7.4.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[29\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.4.5.

\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1 for FR1 and Table 4.1.2.2-2 for FR2.

4\) For single carrier operation, set the BS to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier
output power* (P~rated,c,TRP~).

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation,
use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power
setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test
model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.

5\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex I).

6\) Sweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth.

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex I).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in step 6.

9\) For *BS type 1-O* and *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat
the steps above per involved band where single band test configurations
and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.7.4.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.4.5.1 *BS type 1-O*

The emission measurement result shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with W~gap~
\< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
test requirements specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* on
each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The test requirement for
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in the tables
6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the operating band unwanted emission limits
apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in
another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit is
applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~, f\_offset~max~
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and the operating
band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are carriers
transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply
across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band RIB* or a *single-band RIB* configured
for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the
definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at
the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier
transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified
frequency band.

In addition inside any sub-block gap for a *single-band RIB* operating
in non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative
sum of the test requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on
each side of the sub block gap. The test requirement for each sub block
is specified in the tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3 below, where
in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 6.7.4.5.1.1 Wide Area BS (Category A) {#wide-area-bs-category-a .H6}

For a *RIB* operating in Bands n5, n8, n12, n13, n14, n26, n28, n29,
n71, n85, n106, emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified
in table 6.7.4.5.1.1‑1.

In addition to the requirements in tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to
6.7.4.5.1.5-3, the BS may have to comply with the applicable emission
limits established by FCC Title 47 \[14\], when deployed in regions
where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.

##### 6.7.4.5.1.6.2 Protection of DTT {#protection-of-dtt .H6}

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For *BS type 1-O* operating in Band n20, the level of emissions in
the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to table 6.7.4.5.1.6.2-1, shall not
exceed the maximum emission TRP level shown in the table. This
requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part
of the range falls in the spurious domain.

##### 6.7.4.5.1.6.3 Protection of GPS {#protection-of-gps .H6}

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 10-48 applies for operation in Band n24.
The following normative requirement covers *BS type 1-O* operating in
Band n24 to verify compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA
10-48.

The level of emissions in the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.7.4.5.1.6.3-1 shall not
exceed the maximum emission TRP limits indicated in the table. This
requirement applies in the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz even though
part of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Note: The regional requirements in FCC Order DA 20-48 are defined in
terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent
on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment
(including antenna gain and feeder loss). P~EIRP~ values in table
6.7.4.5.1.6.3-1 are the effective isotropic power (or radiated power
spectral density) set in the FCC Order DA 20-48 for the specified
frequency ranges and bandwidths.

For BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission
limits that might be applicable in the OBUE frequency domain are
specified in clause 6.7.5.4.5.

##### 6.7.4.5.2 *BS type 2-O*

##### 6.7.4.5.2.1 General {#general-10 .H6}

The requirements of either clause 6.7.4.5.2.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 6.7.4.5.2.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*BS type 2-O*) in
clause 6.7.5.2.5.2. In addition, the limits in clause 6.7.4.5.2.4 may
also apply. The emission measurement result shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *contiguous transmission bandwidth*
edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter
closest to the *contiguous transmission bandwidth* edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *contiguous transmission
bandwidth* edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.7.1-1.

In addition, inside any sub-block gap for a *RIB* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the **test requirements** specified for the adjacent sub blocks on
each side of the sub block gap. The test requirement for each sub-block
is specified in the clauses 6.7.4.5.2.2 and 6.7.4.5.2.3 below, where in
this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

### 6.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.7.5.1 General 

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA transmitter spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per
RIB, unless otherwise stated.

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from
30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.7.1. For
some *operating bands*, the upper limit of the spurious range might be
higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit
of the downlink *operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation
SM.329 \[5\].

For *multi-band RIB* each supported *operating band* and the Δf~OBUE~
MHz around each band are excluded from the OTA transmitter spurious
emissions requirements.

Additional limits in clause 6.7.5.4.5 may apply closer than Δf~OBUE~
from the edges of *downlink operating band*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

*BS type 1-O* requirements consists of OTA transmitter spurious emission
requirements based on TRP and co-location requirements not based on TRP.

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR2 shall apply from
30 MHz to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the downlink
*operating band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.7.1.

#### 6.7.5.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

##### 6.7.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

The general OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements are
specified as TRP per RIB, per cell, unless otherwise specified.

##### 6.7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.3.2.

##### 6.7.5.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify if the radiated spurious emissions from
the BS at the RIB are within the specified minimum requirements.

##### 6.7.5.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.5.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-10 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

harmonic)

\- For FR2:

\- B when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

\- T when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 2^nd^ harmonic (or to
60 GHz)

RF bandwidth positions to be tested in single-band multi-carrier
operation, see clause 4.9.1:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

\- T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 12.75 GHz (or
5^th^ harmonic)

\- For FR2:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

\- T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 2^nd^ harmonic
(or to 60 GHz)

RF bandwidth positions to be tested in multi-band multi-carrier
operation, see clause 4.9.1:

\- For FR1:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_Blow\_low~ -
Δf~OBUE~

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_Bhigh\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to
12.75 GHz (or to 5^th^ harmonic)

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when testing from
F~DL\_Blow\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to F~DL\_Bhigh\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I).

##### 6.7.5.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-9 .H6}

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on directional power
measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to measure
TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber. If
so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and operated
within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[29\] the measurement methods are
applicable and selected depending on availability at the test facility.

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.7.5.2.5.

4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

\- The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time
duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty
in Table 4.1.2.2-1 for FR1 and Table 4.1.2.2-2 for FR2.

5\) Set the BS to transmit:

\- For RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the RIB to transmit a signal according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model in
clause 4.9.2 (i.e. NR-FR1-TM1.1 for *BS type 1-O* and NR-FR2-TM1.1 for
*BS type 2-O*), at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power
P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the RIB to transmit according to the corresponding test
model in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured using the applicable
test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
clause 4.7.2 and 4.8.

6\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex I).

7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

8\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order.

9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *BS type 1-O* and *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests,
repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other band.

#### 6.7.5.3 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

##### 6.7.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a *BS type 1-O*.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
in TS 38.104 \[2\], the power levels are specified at the CLTA output.

##### 6.7.5.3.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.7.5.2.

##### 6.7.5.3.3 Test purpose

For OTA co-location spurious emission, the test purpose is to verify
that the emission is within the specified requirement limits at the CLTA
conducted output(s).

##### 6.7.5.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-11 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in *multi-band RIB*, see
clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, emission testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, emission testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested: The requirement is specified as co-location
requirement. For general description of co-location requirements, refer
to clause 4.12.

The co-location spurious emission is measured at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

##### 6.7.5.3.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-10 .H6}

1\) Select and place the NR BS and CLTA as described in clause 4.12 with
parameters as specified in table 4.12.2.2-1 and table 4.12.2.3-1.

2\) Several CLTAs might be required to cover the whole co-location
spurious emission frequency ranges.

3\) Place test antenna in reference direction at far-field distance,
aligned in all supported polarizations (single or dual) with the NR BS
as depicted in annex E.1.3.

4\) The test antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized with the same
frequency range as the NR BS for co-location spurious emission test
case.

5\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
depicted in annex E.1.3.

6\) OTA co-location spurious emission is measured as the power sum over
all supported polarizations at the CLTA conducted output(s).

7\) The measurement device (signal analyzer) characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

8\) Set the *BS type 1-O* to transmit:

\- Set the NR BS to transmit maximum power according to the applicable
test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models or
set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

\- For the NR BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the BS to transmit according to NR-FR1-TM1.1 on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8.

9\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: An alternative measurement method to be used for measuring the OTA
emission is described in annex K.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.7.5.3.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.5.3.5.1 Test requirement for *BS type 1-O* {#test-requirement-for-bs-type-1-o-1 .H6}

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a *BS type 1-O*.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
in TS 38.104 \[2\], the power levels are specified at the CLTA output.

The total power of any spurious emission from both polarizations of the
CLTA connector output shall not exceed the limits in table
6.7.5.3.5.1-1.

#### 6.7.5.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

##### 6.7.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band.
The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.4.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.).

The requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

All additional spurious requirements are TRP unless otherwise stated.

##### 6.7.5.4.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.2.4.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.3.3.

##### 6.7.5.4.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the radiated spurious emissions from the
BS at the RIB are within the specified additional spurious emissions
requirements.

##### 6.7.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-12 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

Directions to be tested: As the requirements are TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I).

##### 6.7.5.4.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-11 .H6}

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[29\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.1) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.7.5.4.5.

4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

\- The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time
duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty
in Table 4.1.2.2-1 for FR1 and Table 4.1.2.2-2 for FR2.

5\) Set the BS to transmit:

\- For RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the RIB to transmit a signal according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model in
clause 4.9.2 (NR-FR1-TM1.1 for *BS type 1-O* and NR-FR2-TM1.1 for *BS
type 2-O*), at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power
P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the RIB to transmit according to NR-FR1-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2
and 4.8.

6\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex I).

7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

8\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order.

9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.7.5.4.5 Test requirement

##### 6.7.5.4.5.1 Test requirement for *BS type 1-O* {#test-requirement-for-bs-type-1-o-2 .H6}

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the test limits in
table 6.7.5.4.5-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the
system listed in the first column apply. For a *multi-band RIB*, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.7.5.4.5-1 apply
for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band n28, the co-existence requirements in 6.7.5.4.5-1 do
not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the
downlink *operating band* (see TS 38.104 \[2\], table 5.2-1). Emission
limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or
regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.5.4.5-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
frequency ranges in TS 38.104 \[2\] table 5.2-1 would be overlapping,
are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of
operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-existence requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent *operating bands* can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may
apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For NR Band n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with E-UTRA Band
27 UL *operating band*.

NOTE 5: For NR Band n29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for NR BS for co-existence with UTRA Band
XII, E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL
operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL or NR Band n85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.7.1.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
in TS 38.104 \[2\], the power levels are specified at the CLTA output.

##### 6.7.5.5.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 9.7.5.2.

##### 6.7.5.5.3 Test purpose

For OTA co-locate spurious emission, the test purpose is to verify that
the emission is within the specified requirement limits at the CLTA
conducted output(s).

##### 6.7.5.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.5.5.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-13 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in *multi-band RIB*, see
clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, emission testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, emission testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested: The FR1 requirement is specified as co-location
requirement. For general description of co-location requirements, refer
to clause 4.12.

The co-location spurious emission is measured at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

##### 6.7.5.5.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-12 .H6}

1\) Select and place the NR BS and CLTA as described in clause 4.12,
with parameters as specified in table 4.12.2.2-1 and table 4.12.2.3-1.

2\) Several CLTAs might be required to cover the whole co-location
spurious emission frequency ranges.

3\) Place test antenna in reference direction at far-field distance,
aligned in all supported polarizations (single or dual) with the NR BS
as depicted in annex E.1.3.

4\) The test antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized with the same
frequency range as the NR BS for co-location spurious emission test
case.

5\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
depicted in annex E.1.3.

6\) OTA co-location spurious emission is measured as the power sum over
all supported polarizations at the CLTA conducted output(s).

7\) The measurement device (signal analyzer) characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

8\) Set the *BS type 1-O* to transmit:

\- Set the NR BS to transmit maximum power according to the applicable
test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models or
set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

\- For the NR BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2
and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on all carriers configured.

9\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the BS transmit
frequency range of a downlink *operating band* (see table 5.2-1 in
TS 38.104 \[2\]). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow
a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are
certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques
are addressed in TR 25.942 \[27\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where
the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in
table 5.2-1 in TS 38.104 \[2\] would be overlapping, are not deployed in
the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent *operating band* can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

6.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array from a co-located base station. The requirement applies
during the *transmitter ON period* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the
operating band.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the total radiated power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the
CLTA.

For *BS type 1-O*, the transmitter intermodulation requirement is
captured by the co-location transmitter intermodulation scenario case,
in which the interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.

### 6.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* operation is defined in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 9.8.2.

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is not applicable for
*BS type 2-O*.

### 6.8.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *RIB* under test to restrict the generation of
intermodulation products in its nonlinear elements caused by presence of
the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter
unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located base station to
below specified levels.

### 6.8.4 Method of test

#### 6.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in *multi-band RIB*, see
clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, emission testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, emission testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested: The FR1 requirement is specified as co-location
requirement. For general description of co-location requirements, refer
to clause 4.12.

#### 6.8.4.2 Procedure

1\) Select a CLTA according to the description in clause 4.12 and
parameters given in table 4.12.2.2-1.

2\) Place the CLTA according to the description in clause 4.12 and
parameters given in table 4.12.2.3-1.

3\) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the
same frequency range as the NR BS and the emission frequencies.

4\) Several test antennas are required to cover both the NR BS and the
whole emission frequency range.

5\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as shown
in annex E.1.5.

6\) During the OTA emission measurements at the test antenna conducted
output(s), both NR BS and CLTA are rotated around same axis.

7\) The OTA emission measurement method shall be TRP, according to the
procedure described in annex I.

8\) The measurement device (signal analyzer) characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

9\) Set the BS *type 1-O* to transmit:

\- Set the NR BS to transmit maximum power according to the applicable
test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models or
set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

\- For the NR BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2
and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on all carriers configured.

10\) Generate the interfering signal using test model as defined in
clause 4.9.2, at a centre frequency offset according to the conditions
in table 9.8.2-1 in TS 38.104 \[2\], but exclude interfering frequencies
that are outside of the allocated downlink operating band or interfering
frequencies that are not completely within the sub-block gap or within
the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

11\) Connect the interfering signal to the CLTA input interfaces,
equally dividing the power among supported polarizations. Adjust the
interfering signal level at the CLTA conducted input(s) as defined in
table 6.8.5.1-1.

12\) If the interfering signal is applicable according to clause 4.7,
perform the unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.7.3 (OTA
ACLR) and 6.7.4 (OTA OBUE) for all third and fifth order intermodulation
products which appear in the frequency ranges defined in clauses 6.7.3
and 6.7.4 (Note 2). The width of the intermodulation products shall be
taken into account.

13\) If the interfering signal is applicable according to clause 4.7,
perform the Transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in
clause 6.7.5 (OTA spurious emission), except OTA co-location spurious
emission, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which
appear in the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.7.5 (Note 2). The
width of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

14\) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level
in clause 6.8.5 (Test requirements) with the exception of interfering
signal frequencies.

15\) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre
frequency offsets defined in table 6.8.5.1-1.

16\) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signals defined in
clause 4.7 for requirements 6.7.3 (OTA ACLR), 6.7.4 (OTA OBUE) and 6.7.5
(OTA spurious emission), except OTA co-location spurious emission.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB,* the following steps shall apply:

17\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

NOTE 1: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2
and 2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at
3F1±2F2, 3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal
centre frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents
the interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are:

\- (n\*BW~F1~ + m\* BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;

\- (n\* BW~F2~ + m\* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;

where BW~F1~ represents the test wanted signal RF bandwidth or channel
bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth and BW~F2~
represents the interfering signal channel bandwidth.

NOTE 2: During the conformance test the interferer signal can be applied
on one side of the wanted signal, while the transmitter intermodulation
emission is measured only on the opposite side of the wanted signal.
This applies for intermodulation products which are within the operating
band or OBUE region.

### 6.8.5 Test requirements

#### 6.8.5.1 Requirement for BS type 1-O

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the TRP unwanted
emission limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious emission in
clause 6.7.5 (except co-location with other base stations), OTA
out-of-band emissions in clause 6.7.4 and OTA ACLR in clause 6.7.3 in
the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering signal, defined in
table 6.8.5.1-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in multiple *operating bands*, the
requirement shall apply relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* of each *operating band*. In case the inter *RF Bandwidth* gap
is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ MHz (where BW~Channel~ is the minimal *BS
channel bandwidth* of the band), the requirement in the gap shall apply
only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls
completely within the inter *RF Bandwidth* gap.

 7 Radiated receiver characteristics
===================================

7.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for receiver tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for radiated
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements apply during the BS receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the transmitter
unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a
*sub-block gap*.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

Each requirement, except OTA receiver spurious emissions, shall be met
over the RoAoA specified.

For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for the reference direction.

And

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for all other directions.

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

For FR2 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction

and

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions

*For BS type 1-H* there is no requirement specified for band n46, n100,
n101 and n102.

*For BS type 1-O* there is no requirement specified for bands n46, n96,
n100, n101 and n102.

7.2 OTA sensitivity
-------------------

### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or
more *OTA sensitivity direction declarations* (OSDD), related to a *BS
type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O* *receiver*.

The *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O* *receiver* may optionally be capable
of redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of adjusting BS
settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity
RoAoA* resulting from the current BS settings is the active *sensitivity
RoAoA*.

If the BS is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- *BS channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target redirection
range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the BS.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TR 37. 941 \[29\].

\- The receiver target reference direction.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

If the *BS* is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related
to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- *BS channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The receiver target reference direction.

NOTE 3: For *BS* without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirement

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 7.2.2 shall be met when the level of
the arriving signal is equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective
declared set of EIS level and *BS channel bandwidth*.

### 7.2.3 Test Purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the BS can meet the throughput
requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the
range of angles of arrival declared in the OSDD.

### 7.2.4 Method of test

#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- receiver target reference direction (D.31),

\- conformance test directions (D.33).

#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the BS under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate
test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.

8\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified
in clause 7.2.5.

9\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization.

10\) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the BS (D.23), and
supported polarizations.

For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 7.2.5 Test requirements

#### 7.2.5.1 General

The minimum EIS level is a declared figure (D.27, D.28) for each OSDD
(D.23). The test requirement is calculated from the declared value
offset by the EIS Test Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.

#### 7.2.5.2 Test requirements for *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 9 of
clause 7.2.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters
specified in table 7.2.5.2-1.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

#### 7.2.5.3 Test requirements for *BS type 2-O*

There is no OTA sensitivity requirement for FR2, the OTA sensitivity is
the same as the OTA reference sensitivity in clause 7.3.

7.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
-----------------------------------

### 7.3.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a directional requirement and is intended
to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a declared
*OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement

For *BS type 1-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.3.2.

For *BS type 2-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.3.3.

### 7.3.3 Test Purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the BS can meet the throughput
requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS~REFSENS~
level and the range of angles of arrival within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

### 7.3.4 Method of test

#### 7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (D.54),

\- OTA REFSENS conformance test directions (D.55).

#### 7.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the BS under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* being tested according to
the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.3.5.

8\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified
in clause 7.3.5.

9\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization.

10\) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OTA REFSENS conformance test directions
of the BS (D.55), and supported polarizations.

For multi-band capable FR1 BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 7.3.5 Test requirements

#### 7.3.5.1 General

The FR1 EIS~REFSENS~ level is the conducted REFSENS requirement value
offset by Δ~OTAREFSENS~. The test requirement is calculated from the
EIS~REFSENS~ level offset by the EIS~REFSENS~ Test Tolerance specified
in clause 4.1.

#### 7.3.5.2 Test requirements for *BS type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 9 of
clause 7.3.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters
specified in tables 7.3.5.2-1 to 7.3.5.2-3.

#### 7.3.5.3 Test requirements for *BS type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 when the OTA test signal
is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level and arrives from any
direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS\_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *BS channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ itself is not a
requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz BS channel bandwidth it does not imply that BS has to
support 50 MHz *BS channel bandwidth*.

For Wide Area BS, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range -96
to -119 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Medium Range BS, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
-91 to -114 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Local Area BS, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
-86 to -109 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

7.4 OTA dynamic range
---------------------

### 7.4.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *BS channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.4.2 Minimum requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.4.2.

### 7.4.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that at the BS receiver dynamic range, the
relative throughput shall fulfil the specified limit.

### 7.4.4 Method of test

#### 7.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal: see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

#### 7.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.2.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the BS under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* being tested according to
the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so that the calibrated radiated power
at the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as follows:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.5.2-1 to 7.4.5.2-3.

b\) Set the signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table
7.4.5.2-1 to 7.4.5.2-3.

8\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2 for each supported
polarization.

For *multi-band RIB(s)* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 7.4.5 Test requirement

#### 7.4.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA dynamic range Test Tolerance specified in
clause 4.1.

#### 7.4.5.2 Test requirements for *BS type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 6 of
clause 7.4.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters
specified in tables 7.4.5.2-1 to 7.4.5.2-3a.

7.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking
----------------------------------------

### 7.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 7.5.1.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system. The wanted and interfering signals apply to
each supported polarization, under the assumption of polarization match.

#### 7.5.1.2 Minimum requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.5.1.2.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.5.1.3.

#### 7.5.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver filter to
suppress interfering signals in the channels adjacent to the wanted
channel.

#### 7.5.1.4 Method of test

##### 7.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge position to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- For BS type 1-O, receiver target reference direction (D.31),

\- For BS type 2-O, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

##### 7.5.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the BS so that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s).

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the OSDD or *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* being tested
according to the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so that the calibrated radiated power
at the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as follows:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.5.1.4.1-1 for *BS type 1-O* and table 7.5.1.4.2-1
for *BS type 2-O*.

b\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal at the adjacent
channel frequency of the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table
7.5.1.4.1-1 for *BS type 1-O* and table 7.5.1.4.2-1 for *BS type 2-O*.

8\) Measure throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization, for multi-carrier and/or CA operation the throughput shall
be measured for relevant carriers specified by the test configuration
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8.

For *multi-band RIB(s)* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

#### 7.5.1.5 Test requirement

##### 7.5.1.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA ACS Test Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.

##### 7.5.1.5.2 Test requirements for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the
interfering signal are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 7.5.1.5.2-1, 7.5.1.5.2-1a and table 7.5.1.5.2-2 for ACS. The
reference measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.3.5.2 and is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\] annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The OTA interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the Base station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio
Bandwidth edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
operating band, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
the NR interfering signal in table 7.5.1.5.2-2. The OTA interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the
sub-block gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap
size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
7.5.1.5.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

##### 7.5.1.5.3 Test requirements for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 7.5.1.5.3-1 and table 7.5.1.5.3-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.3.5.3 and is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\] annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base station RF Bandwidth edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
the NR interfering signal in table 7.5.1.5.3-2. The OTA interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the
sub-block gap.

### 7.5.2 OTA in-band blocking

#### 7.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted OTA interferer, which is an NR signal for
general blocking or an NR signal with one RB for narrowband blocking.

#### 7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.5.2.2.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.5.2.3.

#### 7.5.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to
withstand high-levels of in-band interference from unwanted signals at
specified frequency offsets without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

#### 7.5.2.4 Method of test

##### 7.5.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* edge position to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

For BS type 1-O:

\- receiver target reference direction for the minSENS OSDD (D.31),

\- OTA REFSENS conformance test directions (D.55),

For BS type 2-O:

\- OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (D.54),

\- OTA REFSENS conformance test directions (D.55).

##### 7.5.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the BS to that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s).

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the OSDD or *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* being tested
according to the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so that the calibrated radiated power
at the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as follows:

For general OTA blocking:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.5.2.5.2-1 for *BS type 1-O* and table 7.5.2.5.3-1
for *BS type 2-O*.

b\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal at the specified
frequency offset from the wanted signal to transmit as specified in
table 7.5.2.5.2-1 for *BS type 1-O* and table 7.5.2.5.3-1 for *BS type
2-O*. The interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz
for *BS type 1-O* or as indicated in Table 7.5.2.4.2-1 for *BS type 2-O*
starting from the minimum offset to the channel edges of the wanted
signals.

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.5.2.5.2-2 for *BS type 1-O*.

b\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal at the specified
frequency offset from the wanted signal to transmit as specified in
tables 7.5.2.5.2-2 and 7.5.2.5.2-3 for *BS type 1-O*. Set-up and sweep
the interfering RB centre frequency offset to the channel edge of the
wanted signal according to table 7.5.2.5.2-3.

8\) Measure throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization, for multi-carrier and/or CA operation the throughput shall
be measured for relevant carriers specified by the test configuration
specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8.

9\) Repeat steps 3 to 8 for all the specified measurement directions.

For *multi-band RIB(s)* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

#### 7.5.2.5 Test requirement

##### 7.5.2.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA in-band blocking Test Tolerance specified in
clause 4.1.

##### 7.5.2.5.2 Test requirements for *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal
specified in tables 7.5.2.5.2-1, table 7.5.2.5.2-2 and table 7.5.2.5.2-3
for general OTA and narrowband OTA blocking requirements. Narrowband
blocking requirements shall not be applied for band n104. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.3.5.2 and is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\] annex D.

The OTA in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply in
the in-band blocking frequency range, which is defined within frequency
range from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the
downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band,* where the Δf~OOB~
for *BS type 1-O* is defined in table 7.5.2.5.2-0.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at
least as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table
7.5.2.5.2-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
the in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating
band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables
7.5.2.5.2-1 and 7.5.2.5.2-3.

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
operating band, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at
least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
7.5.2.5.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply
in the narrowband blocking frequency ranges for each supported
*operating band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
7.5.2.5.2-3.

##### 7.5.2.5.3 Test requirements for *BS type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For *BS type 2-O*, the OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals are
provided at RIB using the parameters in table 7.5.2.5.3-1 for general
OTA blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for the OTA
wanted signal is identified in clause 7.3.5.3 and is further specified
in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in TS 38.104 \[2\] annex D.

The OTA blocking requirements are applicable outside the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*.

For *BS type 2-O* the OTA blocking requirement shall apply in the
in-band blocking frequency range, which is defined within frequency
range from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, where the
Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 2-O* is defined in table 7.5.2.5.3-0.

Table 7.5.2.5.3-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands* in FR2

  BS type         Frequency range   *Operating band* characteristics (MHz)     Δf~OOB~ (MHz)

  *BS type 2-O*   FR2-1             F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 4000           1500

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA blocking requirements apply in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.5.2.5.3-1. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

7.6 OTA out-of-band blocking
----------------------------

### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the
receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the *RIB* at its
assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.

For the general OTA out-of-band blocking the requirement applies to the
wanted signal for each supported polarization, under the assumption of
*polarization match.* The interferer shall be polarization matched for
in-band frequencies and the polarization maintained for out-of-band
frequencies.

### 7.6.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.6.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.6.3.

### 7.6.3 Test purpose

The test stresses the ability of the receiver unit associated with the
*RIB* under test to withstand high-level interference from unwanted
signals at specified frequency bands, without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

### 7.6.4 Method of test

#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC):

\- M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~
and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in *multi-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, blocking testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, blocking testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested:

\- For *BS type 1-O*, receiver target reference direction (D.31).

\- For BS type 2-O, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure

##### 7.6.4.2.1 *BS type 1-O* procedure for out-of-band blocking

1\) Place BS and the test antenna(s) according to annex E.2.4.1.

2\) Align the BS and test antenna(s) according to the directions to be
tested.

3\) Connect test antenna(s) to the measurement equipment as shown in
annex E.2.4.1.

4\) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the
same frequency ranges as the *BS* and the blocking frequencies. If the
test antenna does not cover both the wanted and interfering signal
frequencies, separate test antennas for the wanted and interfering
signal are required.

5\) The OTA blocking interferer is injected into the test antenna, with
the blocking interferer producing specified interferer field strength
level for each supported polarization. The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

6\) Generate the wanted signal in receiver target reference direction,
according to the applicable test configuration (see clause 4.8) using
applicable reference measurement channel to the RIB, according to annex
A.1.

7\) For FDD operation, configure the beam peak direction for the
transmitter units associated with the RIB under test according to the
declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier with the carrier set-up and power allocation according to the
applicable test configuration(s) (see clause 4.8). The transmitter may
be turned OFF for the out-of-band blocker tests when the frequency of
the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall inside the
bandwidth of the wanted signal.

8\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals,
levels and the frequency offsets as specified for general test
requirements in table 7.6.5.1.1-1. The distance between the test object
and test antenna injecting the interferer signal is adjusted when
necessary to ensure specified interferer signal level to be received.

9\) The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz
within the frequency range specified in clause 7.6.5.1.1.

10\) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the receiver unit
associated with the RIB, as defined in the clause 7.6.5, for the
relevant carriers specified by the test configuration in clause 4.7 and
4.8.

11\) Repeat for all supported polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

12\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.6.4.2.2 *BS type 1-O* procedure for co-location blocking

1\) Place NR BS and CLTA as specified in clause 4.12.2.3.

2\) Several CLTA are required to cover the whole co-location blocking
frequency ranges. The CLTA shall be selected according to
clause 4.12.2.2.

3\) Align the NR BS and test antenna(s) according to the directions to
be tested.

4\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
depicted in annex E.2.4.2.

5\) The NR BS receives the wanted signal in all supported polarizations,
in the receiver target reference direction from the test antenna.

6\) The OTA co-location blocking interferer is injected via the CLTA.
The CLTA is fed with the specified co-location blocking interferer power
per supported polarization.

7\) Generate the wanted signal in receiver target reference direction,
all supported polarizations, from the test antenna, according to the
applicable test configuration (see clause 4.8) using applicable
reference measurement channel to the RIB, according to annex A.1.

8\) For FDD operation, configure the beam peak direction for the
transmitter units associated with the RIB under test according to the
declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier with the carrier set-up and power allocation according to the
applicable test configuration(s) (see clause 4.8). The transmitter may
be turned OFF for the out-of-band blocker tests when the frequency of
the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall inside the
bandwidth of the wanted signal.

9\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals,
levels and the frequency offsets as specified for general test
requirements in table 7.6.5.1.1-1 and, when applicable, for co-location
test requirements in table 7.6.5.1.2-1.

10\) The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz
within the frequency range corresponding to downlink operating bands
related to co-located systems (according to declaration D.43).

11\) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the receiver unit
associated with the RIB, as defined in the clause 7.6.5, for the
relevant carriers specified by the test configuration in clause 4.7 and
4.8.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

12\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.6.4.2.3 *BS type 2-O* procedure for out-of-band blocking

1\) Place BS and the test antenna(s) according to annex E.2.4.1.

2\) Align the BS and test antenna(s) according to the directions to be
tested.

3\) Connect test antenna(s) to the measurement equipment as shown in
annex E.2.4.1.

4\) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the
same frequency ranges as the *BS* and the blocking frequencies. If the
test antenna does not cover both the wanted and interfering signal
frequencies, separate test antennas for the wanted and interfering
signal are required.

5\) The OTA blocking interferer is injected into the test antenna, with
the blocking interferer producing specified interferer field strength
level for each supported polarization. The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

6\) Generate the wanted signal, according to the applicable test
configuration (see clause 4.7 and 4.8) using applicable reference
measurement channel to the RIB, according to annex A.1.

7\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals,
levels and the frequency offsets as specified for general test
requirements in table 7.6.5.2.1-1. The distance between the test object
and test antenna injecting the interferer signal is adjusted when
necessary to ensure specified interferer signal level to be received.

8\) The interfering signal shall be swept within the frequency range
specified in table 7.6.5.2.1-1 with the step size specified in table
7.6.4.2.3-1 and table 7.6.4.2.3-2.

9\) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the receiver unit
associated with the RIB, as defined in the clause 7.6.5, for the
relevant carriers specified by the test configuration in clause 4.7 and
4.8.

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 in TS 38.104 \[2\] for
each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the OTA out-of-band requirement shall apply for
each supported *operating band*, with the exception that the in-band
blocking frequency ranges of all supported *operating bands* according

out‑of‑band blocking requirement.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 30
MHz to F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750
MHz, including the downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band*
for BS supporting FDD. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 1-O* is defined in table

##### 7.6.5.1.2 Co-location requirement

This additional OTA out-of-band blocking requirement may be applied for
the protection of BS receivers when NR, E‑UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
a BS.

The interferer power level is specified at the CLTA conducted input(s)
as the signal power per supported polarization.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 7.6.5.1.2-1, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 in TS 38.104 \[2\] for
each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For *BS type 1-O* the OTA blocking requirement for co-location with BS
in other frequency bands is applied for all operating bands for which
co-location protection is provided.

#### 7.6.5.2 Requirement for *BS type 2-O* 

The test requirement consists of general requirements.

##### 7.6.5.2.1 General requirement

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 7.6.5.2.1-1 and table 7.6.5.2.1-2, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.3 in TS 38.104 \[2\] for
each *BS channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For *BS type 2-O* within FR2-1 the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement
apply from 30 MHz to F~UL\_low~ -- Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ +
Δf~OOB~ up to min(2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the
*operating band*, 60 GHz). The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 2-O* is defined in
table 7.5.2.5.3-0.

For *BS type 2-O* within FR2-2 the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement
apply from 30 MHz to F~UL\_low~ -- Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ +
Δf~OOB~ up to \[142\] GHz. The Δf~OOB~ for *BS type 2-O* is defined in
table 7.5.2.5.3-0.

7.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions
-----------------------------------

### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from
the antenna array from a receiver unit.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA receiver spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from
30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.7.1. For
some *operating bands*, the upper limit of the spurious range might be
higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit
of the uplink *operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation
SM.329 \[5\].

For *multi-band RIB* the above exclusion applies for each supported
*operating band*.

The OTA receiver spurious emission limits for FR2 shall apply from
30 MHz to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the uplink
*operating band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.7.1.

For a BS operating in FDD, OTA RX spurious emissions requirement do not
apply as they are superseded by the OTA TX spurious emissions
requirement. This is due to the fact that TX and RX spurious emissions
cannot be distinguished in OTA domain.

For a BS operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirement
shall apply during the *transmitter OFF period* only.

The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions for *BS type
1-O* and *BS type 2-O* is total radiated power (TRP), with the
requirement defined at the RIB.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 10.7.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is specified in
TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 10.7.3.

### 7.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify if the receiver radiated spurious
emissions from the BS at the RIB are within the specified minimum
requirements.

### 7.7.4 Method of test

#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier, see clause 4.9.1:

\- For FR1:

\- B when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

\- T when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 12.75 GHz (or to 5^th^
harmonic)

\- For FR2:

\- B when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

\- T when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 2^nd^ harmonic (or to
60 GHz) for FR2-1

\- T when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 2^nd^ harmonic (or to
142 GHz) for FR2-2

RF bandwidth positions to be tested in single-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1:

\- For FR1:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

\- T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 12.75 GHz (or to
5^th^ harmonic)

\- For FR2:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

\- T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 2^nd^ harmonic
(or to 60 GHz) for FR2-1

\- T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 2^nd^ harmonic
(or to 142 GHz) for FR2-2

RF bandwidth positions to be tested in multi-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1:

\- For FR1:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_Blow\_low~ -
Δf~OBUE~

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_Bhigh\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to
12.75 GHz (or to 5^th^ harmonic)

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when testing from
F~DL\_Blow\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to F~DL\_Bhigh\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I).

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[29\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the BS with the test system.

3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 7.7.5.

4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

\- The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time
duration to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty
in Table 4.1.2.3-1 for FR1 and Table 4.1.2.3-2 for FR2.

5\) Set the TDD BS to receive only.

6\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex I).

7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth

8\) Repeat step 6-9 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order

9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *BS type 1-O* and *multi-band RIB(s)* and single band tests,
repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other band.

### 7.7.5 Test requirement

#### 7.7.5.1 Test requirement for *BS type 1-O*

For RX only *multi-band RIB*, the OTA receiver spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in table
7.7.5.1-1:

*BS type 1-O*

7.8 OTA receiver intermodulation
--------------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver unit to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal. The requirement is
defined as a directional requirement at the *RIB*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.8.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.8.3.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the *BS* receiver to
inhibit the generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear
elements caused by the presence of two high-level interfering signals at
frequencies with a specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted
signal.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier
and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band operation*, see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (D.54).

\- In addition, for *BS type 1-O*, receiver target reference direction
(D.31).

#### 7.8.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.6.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the BS to that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s).

5\) Configure the beam peak direction of the BS according to declared
reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit the beam(s) of the same
operational band as the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* or OSDD being tested
according to the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified
as follows:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.8.5.1-1 (for general intermodulation) or 7.8.5.1-3
(for narrowband intermodulation) for *BS type 1-O*, or table 7.8.5.2-1
(for general intermodulation) for *BS type 2-O*.

b\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table
7.8.5.1-1 (for general intermodulation) or 7.8.5.1-3 (for narrowband
intermodulation) for *BS type 1-O*, or table 7.8.5.2-1 (for general
intermodulation) for *BS type 2-O*.

8\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.8.5.1-2 (for general
intermodulation) or 7.8.5.1-4 (for narrowband intermodulation) for *BS
type 1-O*, or table 7.8.5.2-2 (for general intermodulation) for *BS type
2-O*.

9\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization, for multi-carrier and/or CA operation the throughput shall
be measured for relevant carriers specified by the test configuration
specified in clause 4.7.

10\) Repeat for all the specified measurement directions and supported
polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

11\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.8.5 Test requirement

#### 7.8.5.1 *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *FR1 OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB with the conditions
specified in tables 7.8.5.1-1 and 7.8.5.1-2 for intermodulation
performance and in tables 7.8.5.1-3 and 7.8.5.1-4 for narrowband
intermodulation performance. Narrowband intermodulation requirements
shall not be applied for band n104.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 7.3.5.2-1, table 7.3.5.2-2 and table 7.3.5.2-3 for each *BS
channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal, except for the
case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and *BS channel
bandwidth* ≤ 20 MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the interfering
signal should be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the Base
Station RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or
Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum within any
*operating band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall apply
in addition inside any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at
least as wide as the *BS channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal
in tables 7.8.5.1-2 and 7.8.5.1-4. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the intermodulation requirement shall apply in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency offset
from the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall
apply in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size
is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in tables 7.8.5.1-2 and
7.8.5.1-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

#### 7.8.5.2 *BS type 2-O*

Throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in tables 7.8.5.2-1 and 7.8.5.2-2. All of the OTA test
signals arrive from the same direction, and the requirement is valid if
the signals arrive from any direction within the *FR2 OTA REFSENS
RoAoA*. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in table 7.3.5.3-1 for each *BS channel bandwidth* and
further specified in annex A.1.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal except for FR2-2
with 400 MHz, 800 MHz, 1600 MHz and 2000 MHz case.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the Base
Station RF Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges.

7.9 OTA in-channel selectivity
------------------------------

### 7.9.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral
density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an NR signal as specified in annex E in TS 38.141-1 \[3\] and shall be
time aligned with the wanted signal.

### 7.9.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *BS type 1-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.9.2.

The minimum requirement for *BS type 2-O* is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 10.9.3.

### 7.9.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the BS receiver ability to
suppress the IQ leakage.

### 7.9.4 Method of test

#### 7.9.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- For BS type 1-O, receiver target reference direction (D.31),

\- For *BS type 2-O*, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

#### 7.9.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the BS to that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s).

5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) For FDD operation, set the BS to transmit beam(s) of the same
operational band as the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA* or OSDD being tested
according to the appropriate test configuration in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified
as follows:

a\) Adjust the signal generator for the wanted signal as specified in:

For *BS type 1-O*, table 7.9.5.1-1 for BS of Wide Area BS class, in
table 7.9.5.1-2 for BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.9.5.1-3 for
BS of Medium Range BS class on one side of the F~C~.

For *BS type 2-O*, tables 7.9.5.2-1, 7.9.5.2-2 and 7.9.5.2-3 on one side
of the F~C~.

b\) Adjust the signal generator for the interfering signal as specified
in:

For *BS type 1-O*, table 7.9.5.1-1 for BS of Wide Area BS class, in
table 7.9.5.1-2 for BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.9.5.1-3 for
BS of Medium Range BS class at opposite side of the F~C~ and adjacent to
the wanted signal.

For *BS type 2-O*, tables 7.9.5.2-1,7.9.5.2-2 and 7.9.5.2-3 at opposite
side of the F~C~ and adjacent to the wanted signal.

8\) Measure throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization.

9\) Repeat the measurement with the wanted signal on the other side of
the F~C~, and the interfering signal at opposite side of the F~C~ and
adjacent to the wanted signal.

10\) Repeat for all the specified measurement directions and supported
polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

9\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.9.5 Test requirement

#### 7.9.5.1 *BS type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For *BS type 1-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in tables 7.9.5.1-1 and 7.9.5.1-1a for
Wide Area BS, in tables 7.9.5.1-2 and 7.9.5.1-2a for Medium Range BS and
in tables 7.9.5.1-3 and 7.9.5.1-3a for Local Area BS.

 8 Radiated performance requirements
===================================

8.1 General
-----------

### 8.1.0 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-O* or *BS type 2-O* to correctly demodulate radiated signals in
various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements
are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the BS are specified for the fixed
reference channels and propagation conditions defined in TS 38.104 \[2\]
annex A and annex J, respectively. The requirements only apply to those
FRCs that are supported by the BS.

The radiated performance requirements for *BS type 1-O* and for the *BS
type 2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulations branches* as described
in clause 8.1.1. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches* depending on the number of polarizations
supported by the BS, with the required SNR applied separately per
polarization.

NOTE 1: BS can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*, however OTA
conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches*.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a BS
supporting CA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For *BS type 1-O* in FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be
met with the transmitter units associated with the RIB in the
*operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE 2: *BS type 1-O* in normal operating conditions in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the tests.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided between the BS and the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the same duration where signal energy exists.

### 8.1.1 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *BS type 1-O*, or the *BS type 2-O* uses polarization diversity
and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each
of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX
test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*, each
demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *BS type 1-O*, or the *BS type 2-O* does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for
o a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

### 8.1.2 Applicability rule

#### 8.1.2.0 General

Unless otherwise stated, for a BS declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*), the
performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply,
and the mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to BS
implementation.

The tests requiring more than \[20\] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the
test requirements.

#### 8.1.2.1 Applicability of PUSCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.2.1.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table
4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests with 30% of maximum
throughput shall apply only for the lowest subcarrier spacing declared
to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1) for each frequency range.

##### 8.1.2.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the BS
supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.2.1.3 Applicability of requirements for different configurations

Unless otherwise stated, for *BS type 1-O*, PUSCH requirement tests
shall apply only for the mapping type declared to be supported (see
D.100 in table 4.6-1). If both mapping type A and type B are declared to
be supported, the tests shall be done for either type A or type B; the
same chosen mapping type shall then be used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, for *BS type 2-O*, PUSCH requirement tests
shall apply only for the additional DM-RS position declared to be
supported (see D.101 in table 4.6-1). If both options (i.e., pos0 and
pos1) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for pos1.

Unless otherwise stated, for *BS type 2-O*, PUSCH requirement tests with
transform precoding disabled shall apply for the PT-RS option declared
to be supported (see D.106 in table 4.6-1). If both PT-RS options
(without and with PT-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall
be done for either without or with PT-RS only; the same chosen option
shall then be used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, for *BS type 2-O*, PUSCH requirement tests with
transform precoding enabled shall be done for without PT-RS.

##### 8.1.2.1.4 Applicability of requirements for uplink carrier aggregation

The tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall be carried out according
to the declaration (see D.108 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, the tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall
apply only for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled, and shall be
conducted on per component carrier basis.

##### 8.1.2.1.5 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if BS supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of the
supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

Note: For PUSCH Performance test cases, FRCs are not expected to be
defined for the special slots, unless otherwise stated.

##### 8.1.2.1.6 Applicability of UL timing adjustment requirements for different scenarios

Unless otherwise stated, for *BS type 1-O*, the tests for UL timing
adjustment for scenario Y and scenario Z shall apply only if high speed
train is declared to be supported (see D.109 in table 4.6-1). A BS that
passes the tests for scenario Y or scenario Z, can also consider the
tests for scenario X passed.

Unless otherwise stated, for *BS type 2-O*, the tests for UL timing
adjustment for scenario Y shall apply only if high speed train is
declared to be supported (see D.109 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.1.7 Applicability of 2-step RA type requirements for different subcarrier spacings

In 2-step RA type requirements, unless otherwise stated, MsgA PUSCH
tests shall be done only for a BS declaring support of 2-step RA type
(see D.115 in table 4.6-1) for one (freely selected) subcarrier spacing
declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.2.1.5.1 and
8.2.1.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and that the
SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.2.1.4.2-2.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.

### 8.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 8.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.1.2.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.2.

#### 8.2.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.2.4.2-1.

### 8.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

#### 8.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by
two parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI part 1 and block
error probability of CSI part 2. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1
%, and the required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 2 not
exceeding 1 %.

The CSI part 1 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information is
sent.

The CSI part 2 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part2 information is
sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 7 bits: 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 40 bits: 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 c3 c4\] = \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is
mapping to the RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\]
for CSI part 2 information.

The 40 bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 are transmitted
simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.2.1.3.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.2.2.3.

#### 8.2.3.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI with CSI
part 1 and CSI part 2 bits multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading
propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured to the
corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A, and
according to additional test parameters listed in table 8.2.3.4.2-1. The
UCI information bit payload per slot is equal to 7bits with CSI part 1
5bits, CSI part 2 2bits, and the UCI information bit payload per slot is
equal to 40 bits with CSI part 1 20bits, CSI part 2 20 bits.

### 8.2.4 Performance requirements for PUSCH for high speed train 

#### 8.2.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions. The performance
requirements for High Speed Train conditions are optional and only apply
for FR2-1 below 30GHz.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1 and clause 8.1.2.4.

The performance requirements for PUSCH for high speed train only apply
to Wide Area Base Stations and Medium Range Base Stations (subject to
declaration).

#### 8.2.4.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O,* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.2.1.4.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.2.2.7.

#### 8.2.4.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under high speed train and multipath fading propogation conditions for a
given SNR.

#### 8.2.4.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.4.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.4.4.2-1 for *BS type 1-O* or table 8.2.4.4.2-1A for *BS type 2-O*.

### 8.2.5 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment 

#### 8.2.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance
requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario Y and scenario Z defined
in Annex J.4 are optional. The performance requirements for UL timing
adjustment scenario Y in FR2 apply only to FR2-1 below 30GHz.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Tables A.4-2B, A.10-4, A.10-5, and A.10-6 are applied for
both UEs. The received power for both UEs is the same. The resource
blocks allocated for both UEs are consecutive. In scenario Y and
scenario Z, Doppler shift is not taken into account.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.5.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 12.2.1.5 and
12.2.2. 8.

#### 8.2.5.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
measured for the moving UE at given SNR under moving propagation
conditions.

#### 8.2.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.5.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.5.4.2-1 and table 8.2.5.4.2-1a.

The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J. Unless stated otherwise,
the MIMO correlation matrices for the gNB are defined in annex J for low
correlation.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.2.5.5 for high
speed train and clause 8.2.5.6 for normal mode and that the SNR at the
BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.2.5.4.2-2.

### 8.2.6 Performance requirements for PUSCH with 0.001% BLER

#### 8.2.6.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a maximum required
transport block error rate (BLER) for a given SNR. The required BLER is
defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the transport block
after reaching the maximum number of HARQ transmissions for the FRCs
listed in annex A.

#### 8.2.6.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.2.1.6.

For *BS type 2-O*, no requirement and no test are defined.

#### 8.2.6.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve 0.001% BLER
under AWGN conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.6.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.6.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.6.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.5.4.2-1.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.

### 8.2.7 Performance requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

#### 8.2.7.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH repetition Type A is determined by
block error probability (BLER). The performance is measured by the
required SNR at block error probability of PUSCH data not exceeding 1 %.
The performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.7.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.2.1.7.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.7.

#### 8.2.7.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve target block
error probability of PUSCH repetition Type A under multipath fading
propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.7.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.7.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.7.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.2.7.5.1 and
clause 8.2.7.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and
that the SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.2.7.4.2-2.

8.2.8 Performance requirements for PUSCH mapping Type B with non-slot
transmission

#### 8.2.8.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH mapping type B with non-slot
transmission is determined by a minimum required throughput for a given
SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum
throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.8.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.1.8.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.5.

#### 8.2.8.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under scenarios with non-slot PUSCH Type B transmission for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.8.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.8.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.8.4.2-1.

### 8.2.9 Performance requirements for MsgA PUSCH

#### 8.2.9.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of MsgA PUSCH is determined by a maximum
allowed block error rate of Msg A received by BS at given SNR for FRCs
listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume that the
precedent preamble of MsgA is correctly detection. The performance
requirements of assume no HARQ retransmission.

These requirements are applicable for wide area and medium range BS that
support 2-step RA type. The requirements are not applied for a local
area BS that supports 2-step RA type.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.

#### 8.2.9.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.2.1.9.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.2.1.4.

#### 8.2.9.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect MsgA PUSCH under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.9.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.9.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.9.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.9.4.2-1.

6\) The channel emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J. Unless stated otherwise,
the MIMO correlation matrices for the gNB are defined in annex J.2.3 for
low correlation.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.2.9.5.1 and
8.2.9.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and that the
SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.2.9.4.2-2.

8\) The test signal generator sends a MsgA including a preamble and
PUSCH signal and the receiver tries to detect the MsgA signal contents.
The MsgA signal is sent with timing offset as described below. The
following statistics are collected: the number of incorrectly decoded
MsgA PUSCH transmitted during the MsgA signal transmission.

The timing offset base value for MsgA signal with 15 kHz SCS is set to
0. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a
value of 0.2 us for *BS type 1-O* with 15 kHz SCS, until the end of the
tested range, which is 3.8 us. At the end of the testing range, the
offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission
is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-1.

Figure 8.2.9.4.2-1: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS
type 1-O with 15 kHz SCS

The timing offset base value for MsgA signal with 30 kHz is set to 0.
This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value
of 0.1 us for *BS type 1-O* with 30 kHz SCS, until the end of the tested
range, which is 2 us. At the end of the testing range, the offset is
reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission is
presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-2.

Figure 8.2.9.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS
type 1-O with 30 kHz SCS

The timing offset base value for MsgA signal with 60 kHz is set to 0.
This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value
of 0.1 us for *BS type 2-O* with 60 kHz SCS, until the end of the tested
range, which is 0.6 us. At the end of the testing range, the offset is
reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission is
presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-3.

Figure 8.2.9.4.2-3: Timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission for BS
type 2-O with 60 kHz SCS

The timing offset base value for MsgA signal with120 kHz is set to 0.
This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value
of 0.1 us for *BS type 2-O* with 120 kHz SCS, until the end of the
tested range, which is 0.5 us. At the end of the testing range, the
offset is reset to zero. The timing offset scheme for MsgA transmission
is presented in Figure 8.2.9.4.2-4.

### 8.2.10 Requirements for interlaced PUSCH

#### 8.2.10.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with interlace allocation is
determined by a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The
required throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for
the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ
retransmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.5.

#### 8.2.10.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.1.1.

For *BS type 2-O*, no requirement and no test are defined.

#### 8.2.10.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.10.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.10.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.10.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.10.4.2-1.

Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.

### 8.2.11 Performance requirements for CG-UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH

#### 8.2.11.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of CG-UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH is
determined by the parameter: block error probability (BLER) of CG-UCI.
The performance is measured by the required SNR at block error
probability of CG-UCI not exceeding 1 %.

The CG-UCI BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding
the CG-UCI information when the CG-UCI information is sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH, the UCI information
only contains CG-UCI information, there is no HACK/ACK, CSI part 1 or
CSI part 2 information transmitted.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined as 18
bits.

The 18 bits CG-UCI information is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 ... c17\] as follows:

\- HARQ process number: \[c0 c1 c2 c3\] = \[ 0 0 0 1\]

\- RV sequence: \[c4 c5\] = \[0 0\]

\- NDI: \[c6\] = \[1\]

\- COT sharing information field: \[c7 c8 ... c17\] = \[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0\]

In the test, PUSCH data and CG-UCI are transmitted simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.2.11.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\] clause 11.2.1.11.

#### 8.2.11.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI with CG-UCI
multiplexed on interlaced PUSCH under multipath fading propagation
conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.11.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.11.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.11.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured to the
corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A, and

### 8.2.12 Performance requirements for TB processing over multi-slot PUSCH (TBoMS)

#### 8.2.12.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH TBoMS is determined by a minimum
required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.8.

#### 8.2.12.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.1.12.

#### 8.2.12.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.12.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.12.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.12.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.12.4.2-1.

### 8.2.13 Performance requirements for PUSCH with DMRS bundling

#### 8.2.13.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with DMRS bundling is determined by
a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput
is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.8.

#### 8.2.13.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.1.13.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.10.

#### 8.2.13.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR with DMRS
bundling.

#### 8.2.13.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.13.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.13.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.13.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.2.13.5.1 and
clause 8.2.13.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and
that the SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

### 8.2.14 Performance requirements for PUSCH for ATG

#### 8.2.14.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH for ATG is determined by a minimum
required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions. The
performance requirements for 1Tx defined in 8.2.1, 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 are
mandatory for a BS declaring support air-to-ground scenario.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.11.

#### 8.2.14.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.1.14.

#### 8.2.14.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under air-to-ground conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.14.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.14.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.14.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.14.4.2-1 for *BS type 1-O.*

### 8.2.15 Performance requirements for PUSCH with enhanced DM-RS

#### 8.2.15.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH with enhanced DM-RS is determined
by a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required
throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs
listed in annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ
re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.1.11.

#### 8.2.15.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.2.1.15.

#### 8.2.15.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.2.15.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.15.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.15.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
8.2.15.4.2-1.

8.3 OTA performance requirements for PUCCH
------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[24\] clause 6.3.3.1
and TS 38.101-2 \[25\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.1 and 11.3.1.2.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.2.1 and 11.3.2.2.

#### 8.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: single carrier M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.3.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\] and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.1.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.2.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.3.1.5.1 and
8.3.1.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and that the
SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level quoted in table 8.3.1.4.2-2.

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[24\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[25\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.3.

For BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.2.3.

##### 8.3.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 8.3.2.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-40 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.3.2.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-39 .H6}

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.2.1.4.2-1.

#### 8.3.2.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[24\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[25\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.3.

For BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.2.3.

##### 8.3.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-41 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.3.2.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-40 .H6}

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.2.2.4.2-1.

value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.3.2.2.5.1 and
8.3.2.2.5.2 for BS type 1-O and BS type 2-O respectively, and that the
SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.3.2.2.4.2-2.

8\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods. The following statistics are kept:
the number of ACK bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the
number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle
periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK
detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one error for the
statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in clause 8.3.2.1.4.2
for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are measured in the same
testing.

### 8.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 2

#### 8.3.3.1 ACK missed detection performance requirements

##### 8.3.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 2 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK on the wanted signal.
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.4.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.2.4.

##### 8.3.3.1.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-42 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier; M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table.4.6-1).

##### 8.3.3.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-41 .H6}

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.3.1.4.2-1.

  ------------------------------------ --------------

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.3.3.1.5.1 and
8.3.3.1.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and that
the SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.3.3.1.4.2-2.

#### 8.3.3.2 UCI BLER performance requirements

##### 8.3.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[24\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[25\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e.,. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

##### 8.3.3.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.4.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.2.4.

##### 8.3.3.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.3.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-43 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.3.3.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-42 .H6}

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branches signals should be transmitted on each polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.3.2.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.3.3.2.5.1 and
8.3.3.2.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and that
the SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.3.3.2.4.2-2.

### 8.3.4 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

#### 8.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[24\] clause 6.3.3.1
and TS 38.101-2 \[25\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

#### 8.3.4.2 Minimum requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.5.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.2.5.

#### 8.3.4.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.4.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference direction* (see D.54 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.3.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.4.4.2-1.

  -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- --------

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.3.4.5.1 and
8.3.4.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and the SNR
at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.3.4.4.2-2.

### 8.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

#### 8.3.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[24\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[25\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

#### 8.3.5.2 Minimum requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.6.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.2.6.

#### 8.3.5.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference direction* (see D.54 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.3.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.4.4.2-1.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in clause 8.3.5.5.1 and
8.3.5.5.2 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* respectively, and that the
SNR at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.3.5.4.2-2.

### 8.3.6 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format

#### 8.3.6.1 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1

##### 8.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-48 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

##### 8.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-46 .H6}

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.7.

##### 8.3.6.1.1.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-47 .H6}

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 8.3.6.1.1.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-48 .H6}

##### 8.3.6.1.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-46 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (D.54).

##### 8.3.6.1.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-45 .H6}

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.6.1.1.4.2-1.

##### 8.3.6.1.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-49 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

##### 8.3.6.1.2.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-47 .H6}

clause 11.3.1.7.

##### 8.3.6.1.2.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-48 .H6}

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.6.1.2.4.2-1.

### 8.3.7 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.7.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user interlaced PUCCH format 0 for
ACK missed detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of
false detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The ACK missed detection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 0
with 1 UCI bits. The UCI information only contains ACK information

The 1bit UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[1\].

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.6.

#### 8.3.7.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.8 and 11.3.1.9.

#### 8.3.7.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.7.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: single carrier M; see clause 4.9.1.

### 8.3.8 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.8.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.8.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of interlaced PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK
to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when a NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The NACK to ACK detection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 1
with 2 UCI bits. The UCI information only contains ACK/NACK information.

The 2bits UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[0 1\].

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.6.

##### 8.3.8.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.9.

##### 8.3.8.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 8.3.8.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.8.1.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-49 .H6}

#### 8.3.8.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.8.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of interlaced PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The ACK missed detection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 1
with 2 UCI bits. The UCI information only contains ACK/NACK information.

The 2bits UCI information is further defined with bitmap as \[0 1\].

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.6.

##### 8.3.8.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\],
clause 11.3.1.9.

##### 8.3.8.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.8.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.8.2.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-50 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.3.8.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-49 .H6}

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.8.2.4.2-1.

8\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods. The following statistics are kept:
the number of ACK bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the
number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle
periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK
detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one error for the
statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in clause 8.3.8.1.4.2
for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are measured in the same
testing.

### 8.3.9 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 2

#### 8.3.9.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The UCI block error probability performance requirement only applies to
the PUCCH format 2 with 22 UCI bits.

The 22bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defines in clause 8.1.2.6.

### 8.3.10 Performance requirements for interlaced PUCCH format 3

#### 8.3.10.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of interlaced PUCCH format 3 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK on the
wanted signal. The performance is measured by the required SNR at
probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The ACK missed detection requirement only applies to the PUCCH format 3
with 4 UCI bits. The UCI information only contains ACK information.

The 4bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap as \[1
1 1 1\].

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defines in clause 8.1.2.6.

### 8.3.11 Performance requirements for PUCCH sub-slot based repetition format 0

#### 8.3.11.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH sub-slot based repetition format 0
for ACK missed detection is determined by the two parameters:
probability of false detection of the ACK and the probability of
detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the required SNR at
probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The ACK missed detection probability performance requirement only apply
to PUCCH format 0 with 1 UCI bit. The UCI information only contain ACK
information.

The 1bit UCI information is further defined with the bitmap as \[1\].

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[24\] clause 6.3.3.1
and TS 38.101-2 \[25\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.3.11.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.10.

#### 8.3.11.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.11.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.11.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: single carrier M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.3.11.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\] and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.11.4.2-1.

### 8.3.12 Performance requirements PUCCH format 1 with DM-RS bundling

#### 8.3.12.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.3.12.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 with DM-RS bundling for
NACK to ACK detection is determined by the two parameters: probability
of false detection of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability.
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of the
NACK to ACK detection equal to 0.1 % or less. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 1 % or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

##### 8.3.12.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.3.1.8.

For BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.3.2.7.

##### 8.3.12.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 8.3.12.1.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.12.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

###### 8.3.12.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.12.1.4.2-1.

8\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods that conform with the required *actual
Time Domain Window* (aTDW) needed by the tests (see subclause 8.2.14xx).
The following statistics are kept: the number of ACK bits falsely
detected in the idle periods and the number of missed ACK bits. Each
falsely detected ACK bit in the idle periods is accounted as one error
for the statistics of false ACK detection, and each missed ACK bit is
accounted as one error for the statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in clause
8.3.12.1.4.2 for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are measured in
the same testing.

#### 8.3.12.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.3.12.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

##### 8.3.12.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.3.1.8.

For BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.3.2.7.

##### 8.3.12.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.3.12.2.4 Method of test

###### 8.3.12.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

###### 8.3.12.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.12.2.4.2-1.

8\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods. The following statistics are kept:
the number of ACK bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the
number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle
periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK
detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one error for the
statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in
clause 8.3.12.1.4.2 for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are
measured in the same testing.

##### 8.3.12.2.5 Test Requirement

###### 8.3.12.2.5.1 Test Requirement for BS type 1-O

The fraction of falsely detected ACK bits shall be less than 1 % and the
fraction of correctly detected ACK bits shall be larger than 99 % for
the SNR listed in table 8.3.12.2.5.1-1 and table 8.3.12.2.5.1-2.

### 8.3.13 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3 with DM-RS bundling

#### 8.3.13.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.2.

#### 8.3.13.2 Minimum requirement

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.3.1.9.

For BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause
11.3.2.10.

#### 8.3.13.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 8.3.13.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.13.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table.4.6-1).

##### 8.3.13.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to TS 38.211 \[20\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in table 8.3.13.4.2-1.

8\) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable
codebook, in regular time periods. The following statistics are kept:
the number of ACK bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the
number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle
periods is accounted as one error for the statistics of false ACK
detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one error for the
statistics of missed ACK detection.

Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed
detection has the same condition as that described in
clause 8.3.12.1.4.2 for NACK to ACK detection. Both statistics are
measured in the same testing.

8.4 OTA performance requirements for PRACH
------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection

#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is
determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection
of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd).
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.

Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection
of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input
is only noise.

Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble
when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several
error cases -- detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that
was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct
preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value. For AWGN,
TDLC300-100, TDLA30-10, TDLA30-300, TDLA30-650, and TDLA10-650, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the
strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance values given in
table 8.4.1.1-1.

optional and only for a BS declare to support HAPS scenario (see D.128
in table 4.6-1).

#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.4.1.1 and 11.4.1.2.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[2\]
clause 11.4.2.1 and 11.4.2.2.

#### 8.4.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect PRACH preamble
under static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for
a given SNR.

#### 8.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.4.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Set the BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network
in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation
branch signals should be transmitted on one polarization of the test
antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

6\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex J.

7\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel
bandwidth. The power level for the transmission may be set such that the
AWGN level at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.4.1.4.2-1.

10\) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries
to detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in
figure 8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets
as described below. The following statistics are kept: the number of
preambles detected in the idle period and the number of missed
preambles.

Unless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble
format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop,
by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested
range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing
offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH
preamble format 0 and 1 is presented in Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2.

1

Unless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble
format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased
within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end
of the tested range, which is 0.8us. Then the loop is being reset and
the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH
preamble format A1, A2, A3, B4, C0 and C2 is presented in Figure
8.4.1.4.2-3 for 15 kHz, 30 kHz, 60 kHz, and 120 kHz SCS.

For test requirement specified in Table 8.4.1.6.2-1, the timing offset
base value for PRACH preamble format C2 is set to 0. This offset is
increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.48us,
until the end of the tested range, which is 4.8us. Then the loop is
being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset
scheme for PRACH preamble format C2 is presented in Figure 8.4.1.4.2-4.

For test requirements with 480 kHz SCS, the timing offset base value for
PRACH preamble format A2, B4, and C2 is set to 0. This offset is
increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us,
until the end of the tested range, which is 0.4us. Then the loop is

######## Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the BS is to be tested are defined.

For OTA requirements where it is not possible to environmentally control
the entire calibrated OTA chamber either localised control of the BS
hardware or alternative OTA measurements which are then related to the
original specification are acceptable, see annex B.7.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table D.1.

Table B.1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[7\];

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[8\];

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[9\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.1 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

Minimum temperature:

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\].

Maximum temperature:

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[12\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

Upper voltage limit:

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

Lower voltage limit:

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in annex B
shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

B.7 OTA extreme test methods
============================

B.7.1 Direct far field method
-----------------------------

The BS under test is placed inside a sealed RF transparent environmental
enclosure, as showed in Figure B.7.1-1. This is connected to an
environment control system which regulates the temperature inside the
enclosure. The remaining equipment inside the OTA chamber (any suitable
antenna test range chamber type is acceptable) is outside the
environmental control and is at nominal temperature. Positioners, test
antennas and all other OTA test equipment do not need to be specified
over the extreme temperature range.

![](./media/image49.emf){width="6.69375in"
height="2.9067979002624673in"}

Figure B.7.1-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP
accuracy using direct far field method

The presence of the environmental chamber inside the OTA chamber may
affect the measurement accuracy due to additional reflections and
refractions, also the loss through the environmental enclosure may not
be consistent with direction as the path through the radome may vary
with angle. Hence the system should be calibrated in all tested
directions, frequencies and temperatures if necessary.

NOTE: Currently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing
so a single calibration direction is sufficient.

Conformance may be demonstrated by measuring the difference between the
nominal measurement and the extreme measurement (Δ~sample~) or by
measuring P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ directly.

Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2)
and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

B.7.2 Relative method
---------------------

The BS under test is placed inside a small (compared to a far field
chamber) anechoic chamber which is both RF a screened and suitable for
environmental conditioning. The RF conditions inside the chamber are
absorptive and capable of dissipating the power of the BS when
radiating. A sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which
gives a sample of the main beam EIRP but does not have to accurately
measure the EIRP directly, instead the near-field response is measured.
For this method test components are exposed to the full temperature
range for example the test antenna/probe, cables, absorbers etc. may
change as a function of temperature.

Using the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under
nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near
filed) test range to obtain P~max,c,EIRP~.

![](./media/image50.emf){width="5.122916666666667in"
height="2.660416666666667in"}

Figure B.7.2-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP
accuracy using difference method

Measurements from the test antenna/probe are taken under nominal
conditions and extreme conditions to calculate (Δ~sample~). The
difference between the nominal and extreme conditions (Δ~sample~) is
then used along with the nominal EIRP measurement (P~max,c,EIRP~) made
in the appropriate far field or near field chamber and compared against
the extreme requirement. As follows:

P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ = P~max,c,EIRP~ + Δ~sample~.

Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2)
and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

######## Annex C (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test requirements

The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core
specification TS 38.104 \[2\] using the test tolerances (TT) defined
here. When the TT value is zero, the test requirement will be the same
as the minimum requirement. When the TT value is non-zero, the test
requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula
used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.

The TT~OTA~ values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the TT~OTA~ values may sometimes be set to zero.

The TT~OTA~ values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch,
cable loss, etc.).

Note that a formula for applying TT~OTA~ values is provided for all OTA
tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in
the case where the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that
allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be
subtracted from the defined TT~OTA~ value in order to generate the
correct tightened test requirements as defined in this annex.

######## Annex F (normative): Void

######## Annex G (informative): Transmitter spatial emissions declaration

G.1 General
===========

The transmitter spatial emission declaration is an optional declaration
which provides additional information on the power level of emission in
the intended (in cell) spatial directions and the unintended (out of
cell) spatial directions. The declarations are only valid when the beam
is configured in one of the EIRP conformance directions.

![](./media/image69.emf){width="4.239583333333333in"
height="3.4895833333333335in"}

Figure G.1-1: Example of out of cell directions set and declared single
beam at a single extreme steering direction

The declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many circumstances
not directly relate to system performance on its own. This is because it
is often not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted radiation,
and furthermore because the benefits of optimizing beamforming
performance may outweigh the impacts of \"unwanted\" radiation, leading
to systems with apparently higher unwanted radiation also providing
superior throughput performance. System performance should additionally
be characterized taking all factors into account.

NOTE 1: The declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many
circumstances not directly relate to system performance on its own. This
is because it is often not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted
radiation, and furthermore because the benefits of optimizing
beamforming performance may outweigh the impacts of \"unwanted\"
radiation, leading to systems with apparently higher unwanted radiation
also providing superior throughput performance. System performance
should additionally be characterized taking all factors into account.

NOTE 2: The average out of cell power level reflects the impact of out
of cell radiation on other cells more accurately than the out of cell
power level for individual test beams.

######## Annex I (normative): TRP measurement procedures

I.1 General
===========

The annex describes various procedures for BS OTA TRP measurments. These
procedures can provide either an accurate or an over-estimate of TRP
values. The procedures for an accurate estimate can be applied to all
TRP requirements. However, if a TRP requirement does not need accurate
TRP estimate then the procedures for over-estimate of TRP may be used in
order to have a reasonable OTA test time. Pre-scan does not provide an
accurate TRP estimate or over-estimate of TRP. Pre-scan is a fast but
coarse method that is used to identify the spurious emission frequencies
with emission power as described in annex I.13. A sequential measurement
is then made at the emission frequencies, to assess the TRP as described
in annex I.2 to annex I.9.

When making TRP measurements the alignment between EUT and measurement
antenna is important to achieve expected measurement uncertainty:

1\. The measurement antenna needs to be aligned tangential to the
measurement surface forming a sphere around the EUT, in order to
correctly measure the TRP properly.

2\. Test methods described in clauses I.5.1, I.5.2, I.10, I.11 and I.12
require angular alignment between the selected measurement grid and EUT
radiation pattern in order to measure peak values in the main beams.
Angular misalignment can lead to differences in the actual and measured
angular positions of the intended maximum EIRP.

3\. Test methods described in clause I.5.3, I.6 and I.9 are designed to
be independent of rotations of the angular grid, and hence angular
alignment between the measurement grid and EUT is not needed.

I.2 Spherical equal angle grid
==============================

I.2.1 General
-------------

TRP~Estimate~ is defined as

$$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}{\text{EIRP}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m})\sin\theta_{n}}}$$

when EIRP measurements is used or as

$$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = 4\pi d^{2}\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}{P_{D}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m})\sin\theta_{n}}}$$

when power density measurements are used, and d is the test distance. N
and M are the number of samples in the $\theta$ and $\phi$ angles. Each
($\theta_{n},\phi_{m}$) is a sampling point. The sampling angular
intervals for $\theta$ and $\phi$ angles are
$\Delta\theta = \frac{\pi}{N}$ and $\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{M}$. The
sampling intervals $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$ are described in
I.2.2.

I.2.2 Reference angular step criteria
-------------------------------------

The reference angular steps $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ and
$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$ in degrees are defined as:

$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}} = \ min(\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\frac{\lambda}{D_{\text{cyl}}},15^{\circ})$

$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = min(\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\frac{\lambda}{D},15^{\circ})$

The upper limit for these reference angular steps of $15^{\circ}$
ensures a low Summation Error (SE) when $\lambda\ $is large compared to
the EUT dimensions.

D~cyl~ and D are calculated as:

\` $D_{\text{cyl}} = \sqrt{d^{2} + w^{2}}$

$D = \sqrt{d^{2} + w^{2} + h^{2\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }}\text{\ \ \ }$

The definition of d, w and h is shown in figure I.2.2-1. The radiation
source can be EUT antenna array or the whole of EUT.

![](./media/image70.png){width="3.803472222222222in"
height="3.872916666666667in"}

Figure I.2.2-1: Dimensions of a radiation source: depth (d), width (w)
and height (h)

Optionally, in the case of Uniform Linear Array (ULA), when d is
negligible (d $\approx 0$) and the EUT is mounted along the yz plane as
shown in figure I2.2-2, the reference angular steps, in degrees, can be
determined by

${\mathrm{\Delta}\theta}_{\text{ref}} = min(\frac{180^{{^\circ}}}{\pi}arcsin(\frac{\lambda}{D_{z}}),15^{{^\circ}})$

$\text{Δϕ}_{\text{ref}} = min(\frac{180^{{^\circ}}}{\pi}arcsin(\frac{\lambda}{D_{y}}),15^{{^\circ}})$

Where D~y~ is the length of radiating parts of EUT along y-axis, D~z~ is
the length of radiating parts of EUT along the z-axis and is wavelength
for the measured frequency.

height="3.1493055555555554in"}

Figure I2.2-2: Spherical coordinate for OTA conformance testing of EUT

Where due to practical reasons such as time constraints or turn-table
precision, measurement with the reference steps is not practical,
sparser grids can be used. Use of sparse grids can lead to errors in TRP
assessment. In order to characterize these errors, the SF (sparsity
factor) of the grid is defined as

$\text{SF} = \max\left( \frac{\text{Δθ}_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\text{Δϕ}_{\text{grid}}}{\text{Δϕ}_{\text{ref}}} \right)$

Where $\text{Δθ}_{\text{grid}}\ $and $\text{Δϕ}_{\text{grid}}$ are the
actual angular steps used in the measurement.

Alternatively, when EUT radiating dimensions are not known, for each
frequency within the *downlink operating band* including Δf~OBUE~, the
reference angular steps can be specified in terms of the *beamwidth* of
the wanted signal as

$\mathrm{\Delta}\phi_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{o}}\ \text{BeW}_{\phi}$

$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{o}}\ \text{BeW}_{\theta}$

where λ~o~ is the wavelength of the wanted signal, and BeW~φ~ and BeW~θ~
are the *beamwidth* of the wanted signal in the φ-axis and θ-axis,
respectively.

BeW~φ~ and BeW~θ~ may be set to *beamwidth* declared for the OTA BS
radiated transmit power requirement provided the same *beam* is applied
to test in-band TRP requirements.

NOTE: *Beamwidth* is approximately equal to half the first-null beam
width.

I.3 Spherical equal area grid
=============================

TRP~Estimate~ is defined as

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\text{EIRP}(\theta_{n},\phi_{n})}$

N is the total number of samples and specified as

The sampling intervals ${\Delta\theta}_{\text{ref}}$ and
${\Delta\phi}_{\text{ref}}$ are described in annex I.2.2. Each
($\theta_{n},\phi_{n}$) is a sampling point.

I.4 Spherical Fibonacci grid
============================

TRP~Estimate~ is defined as

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1}{\text{EIRP}(\theta_{n},\phi_{n})}$

*N* is the total number of samples and specified as

The sampling intervals ${\Delta\theta}_{\text{ref}}$ and
${\Delta\phi}_{\text{ref}}$ are described in annex I.2.2. Each
($\theta_{n},\phi_{n}$) is a sampling point, where $\theta_{n}$ and
$\phi_{n}$, in degrees, are defined as:

$$\theta_{n} = \cos^{- 1}\left( 1 - \frac{2n + 1}{N} \right)$$

$$\phi_{n} = \frac{360^{{^\circ}}n}{\Psi},\ \ \Psi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$$

I.5 Orthogonal cut grid
=======================

I.5.1 General
-------------

Here, at least two cuts (default) shall be used, an optional third cut
can be used. The alignment of the cuts must be along the symmetry planes
of the antenna array. No alignment is required for spurious emissions.

When alignment is required:

1\) The first mandatory cut is a horizontal cut passing through the peak
direction of the main beam.

2\) The second mandatory is a vertical cut passing through the peak
direction of the main beam. Using the data from these two mandatory
cuts, a conditional pattern multiplication can be used.

3\) The third optional cut is a vertical cut orthogonal to the first and
the second cut.

When alignment is not required, the cuts can be aligned arbitrarily.

Once the number and the orientation of the cuts are decided, the total
EIRP is measured on the orthogonal cuts and the TRP is then calculated
as follows: First the contributions from each cut is calculated as

$\text{EIRP}_{\text{av},\text{cut} - n} = \frac{1}{P}\sum_{j = 1}^{P}{\text{EIRP}(j)}$

where *P* is the number of sampling points in the cut. The final
contribution for all cuts is calculated as

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\text{EIRP}_{\text{av},\text{cut} - n}$

**where *N* is the number of cuts**. Note that when orthogonal cuts are
measured, the interclause points are measured multiple times and the
repeated values can be removed from the samples before averaging.

When two cuts measurements are used, a conditional pattern
multiplication can be applied. The following are the conditions for
applying pattern multiplication:

i\. The vertical cut (and the main beam) is in the $\text{xz}$ -plane

ii\. The frequency of the emission is within the downlink operating
band.

iii\. The bandwidth of the emission is the same as the bandwidth of the
in-band modulated signal

iv\. The emission appears/disappears when the Tx power is turned on/off.

v\. The antenna arrays of the EUT

1\) Have rectangular grids of antenna element positions

2\) Have symmetry planes that are vertical and horizontal.

3\) Have parallel antenna planes

The antenna array is here assumed to be placed in the *yz*-plane. The
pattern multiplication is performed in *uv*-coordinates and the data in
the two cuts are denoted $\text{EIRP}_{cut1}^{}\left( \phi \right)$ at
$\theta = \theta_{H}\ $and a vertical cut with data
$\text{EIRP}_{cut2}^{}\left( \theta \right)$ at $\phi = 0$. The data is
split in two parts corresponding to the forward and backward
hemispheres. The *uv*-coordinates are the projections of the angular
directions onto the antenna plane, here the *yz*-plane. Using the
spherical coordinates as depicted in figure I.2.2-1 the *u* and *v*
coordinates are defined as:

$\left\{ \begin{matrix}
u = \sin{\theta\sin\phi} \\
v = \cos\theta \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

Note that only the data on the cuts are measured.

Calculate power density/EIRP values outside the two cardinal cuts as

$\text{EIRP}\left( u,v \right) = \frac{\text{EIR}P_{cut1}^{}\left( u \right)\text{EIR}P_{cut2}^{}\left( v \right)}{\text{EIRP}\left( 0,v_{H} \right)}$

The pattern multiplication is applied separately for the forward (fwd)
and backward (bwd) hemisphere. The TRP is then calculated as

$TRP = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left\lbrack \iint_{\text{fwd}}^{}{\text{EIRP}_{\text{fwd}}^{}\left( u,v \right)\frac{dudv}{\sqrt{1 - u^{2} - v^{2}}} +}\iint_{\text{bwd}}^{}{\text{EIRP}_{\text{bwd}}^{}\left( u,v \right)\frac{dudv}{\sqrt{1 - u^{2} - v^{2}}}} \right\rbrack$

NOTE: The numerical singularity at $u^{2} + v^{2} = 1$ must be treated
with care, e.g. by change of variables.

I.5.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
---------------------------------------

The procedure is as follows:

1\) Follow steps described in annex I.5.1 for the first two mandatory
cuts and calculate the TRP~Estimate~.

2\) Compare the TRP~Estimate~ to the limit.

3\) If the TRP~Estimate~ is above the limit, perform the measurement on
an additional third cut and repeat steps 1 to 2.

I.5.3 Spurious unwanted emissions
---------------------------------

The procedure is as follows:

1\) Follow steps described in annex I.5.1 for two cuts and calculate the
preliminary TRP~Estimate~.

2\) Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to table
I.5.3-1 to ensure overestimation with 95% confidence.

3\) Compare the corrected TRP~Estimate~ (including ΔTRP) to the limit.

4\) If the corrected TRP~Estimate~ is above the limit, perform the
measurement on an additional third cut and repeat steps 1 to 3.

Table I.5.3-1: The correction factor for two or three cuts dense
sampling

                                Three cuts   Two cuts
  ----------------------------- ------------ ----------
  Correction factor ΔTRP (dB)   2.0          2.5

I.6 Wave vector space grid
==========================

If EUT is mounted along the yz plane as shown in figure I.2.2-1, the
reference step in wave vector space can be determined by

$\Delta u_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{y}}$

$\Delta v_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{z}}$

where *D~y~* is the length of radiating parts of EUT along y-axis,
*D~z~* is the length of radiating parts of EUT along the z-axis.

According to the relationship between the normalized wave vector and
spherical coordinate, the wave vector can be represented as following:

$$u = \sin\left( \theta \right)\sin\left( \phi \right),\ v = cos(\theta)$$

The total radiated power (TRP) in the wave vector space is determined
by:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{estimate}} = \frac{{\Delta u}_{\text{ref}}\Delta v_{\text{ref}}}{4\pi}\left( \sum_{\begin{matrix}
u^{2} + v^{2} < 1 \\
\cos\phi > 0 \\
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n} \right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } + \sum_{\begin{matrix}
u^{2} + v^{2} < 1 \\
\cos\phi < 0 \\
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n} \right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } \right)$

For spurious Tx or Rx emissions and where due to practical reasons such
as time constraints or turn-table precision, measurement with the
reference steps is not practical, sparser grids can be used. Use of
sparse grids can lead to errors in TRP assessment. In order to
characterize these errors, the SF (sparsity factor) of the grid is
defined as

$\text{SF} = \max\left( \frac{{\mathrm{\Delta}u}_{\text{grid}}}{\mathrm{\Delta}u_{\text{ref}}},\frac{{\mathrm{\Delta}v}_{\text{grid}}}{\mathrm{\Delta}v_{\text{ref}}} \right)$

Where $\mathrm{\Delta}u_{\text{grid}}$and
${\mathrm{\Delta}v}_{\text{grid}}$ are the actual steps used in the wave
vector space in the measurement and the upper bound of their value is
1/12, corresponding to 15 degree steps close to boresight.

I.7 Void
========

I.8 Void
========

I.9 Full sphere with sparse sampling
====================================

The procedure is as follows:

1\) Set the angular grid:

a\. Non-harmonic frequencies: choose the angular steps $\Delta\phi$ and
$\Delta\theta$ smaller than or equal to 15 degrees. Calculate the
sparsity factor (SF) as

$\text{SF} = \max\left( \frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}} \right)$

and the correction factor as:

$\text{ΔTRP} = \frac{SF - 1}{SF_{\max} - 1} \cdot 1.0\ dB,$

where $SF_{\max}$ *corresponds to 15 degrees angular step.* If the
sparsity factor is smaller than 1, the correction factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.

Harmonic frequencies with fixed beam test signal: choose the angular
steps smaller than or equal to the reference angular steps
$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. Correction
factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.

Harmonic frequencies with beam sweeping test signal: set the angular
steps to 15 degrees. Correction factor is ΔTRP 0 dB.

2\) Apply a suitable numerical integration to calculate the preliminary
TRP~Estimate~.

3\) Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to step 1 to
ensure an overestimation with 95 % confidence.

4\) Compare the corrected TRP~Estimate~ (including ΔTRP) with the limit.
If the corrected TRP~Estimate~ is above the limit, choose a smaller
angular step and repeat steps 2-4. If the sparsity factor is less than
one, no significant improvement of accuracy is expected.

I.10 Beam-based directions
==========================

Beam-based direction can be used in the base station *operating band*
only if the directivity of the radiation pattern of the emssions being
measured is known. TRP~Estimate~ is defined as

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}}{D_{\text{EUT}}}$,
where $\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}$ is the maximum EIRP in the beam peak
direction within a particular beam direction pair and $D_{\text{EUT}}$
is the directivity of the EUT.

I.11 Peak method
================

The peak method can be used when frequencies with unwanted peak
emissions are identified during pre-scan. The method does not provide an
estimate of TRP.

For each peak emission frequency identified during pre-scan, measure
peak EIRP or power density as follows:

1\) Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the peak
emission is recorded during the pre-scan.

2\) Move the EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to
find the final peak EIRP or power density.

3\) The measured peak power density or EIRP shall be used to demonstrate
conformance.

NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarized
components.

I.12 Equal sector with peak average
===================================

Equal sector with peak average can be performed on frequencies with
unwanted peak emission, which are considered by the peak method for
further measurements.

The spherical angle $\phi$ is divided into K equal sectors. If the
largest dimension of EUT is less than 60 cm, then each sector is a half
quadrant of 45°.

For each peak emission frequency, measure peak EIRP of beams belonging
to different sectors of the sphere as follows:

1\) Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the emission
peak is recorded during the pre-scan.

2\) Move EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find
the final peak EIRP.

3\) Repeat Steps 1 to 2 until all sectors are covered.

4\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ as

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\text{EIRP}_{k}$,
where $\text{EIRP}_{k}$ is the peak EIRP in the kth sector.

NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarized
components.

I.13 Pre-scan
=============

Pre-scan is used to identify frequencies with unwanted emission power
levels above a certain threshold. The pre-scan does not provide an
estimate of TRP. An emission frequency identified by a pre-scan may be
further investigated by any of the TRP measurement methods in this
annex.

The procedure for pre-scan is as follows:

1\) Scan the entire surface around EUT.

2\) Rotate test antenna to cover all possible polarizations of emissions
to detect maximum emissions.

3\) Record the list of frequencies and corresponding unwanted emission
power levels, EUT spatial positions, and test antenna polarization for
which the maximum emission levels occur.

4\) Emissions which 20 dB or more below the specified limit shall not
require further measurements.

######## Annex J (normative): Propagation conditions

J.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

J.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

\- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz), FR2-1 (24.25
-- 52.6 GHz) and FR2-2 (52.6 -- 71 GHz).

Initial channel matrix for LOS component of TDL-D channel model is equal
to channel matrix of Static propagation conditions in Clause B.1 in TS
38.101-4.

J.2.1 Delay profiles
--------------------

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[23\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in annex J.2.1.1 and J.2.1.2 can be used as such.

Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[23\].

Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[23\].

Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them
by calculating their linear power sum.

Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
taps as follows

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8
dB)

Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of
the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

NOTE 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables J.2.1.1-2, J.2.1.1-3,
J.2.1.1-4, and J.2.1.2-2 for the corresponding model.

NOTE 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

NOTE 3: Delay profile for TDLD30 is generated under assumption that
Steps 1-8 are applied for taps with Rayleigh distribution.

### J.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in J.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables J.2.1.1-2 \~ J.2.1.1-4.

J.2.2 Combinations of channel model parameters
----------------------------------------------

The propagation conditions used for the performance measurements in
multi-path fading environment are indicated as a combination of a
channel model name and a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e.,
TDLA\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>, TDLB\<DS\>-\<Doppler\> or TDLC\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>
where \'\<DS\>\' indicates the desired delay spread and \'\<Doppler\>\'
indicates the maximum Doppler frequency (Hz).

Table J.2.2-1 and J.2.2-2 show the propagation conditions that are used
for the performance measurements in multi-path fading environment for
low, medium and high Doppler frequencies for FR1 and FR2, respectively.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in table J.2.3.1.2-2, J.2.3.1.2-3 and J.2.3.1.2-4 as below.

The values in table J.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](./media/image93.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.3125in"}

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
table J.2.3.1.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision with a =0.00012.

NOTE: For completeness, the correlation matrices were defined for high,
medium and low correlation but performance requirements exist only for
low correlation.

### J.2.3.2 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in J.2.3.2 apply to two
cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both UE and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

#### J.2.3.2.1 Definition of MIMO correlation matrices using cross polarized antennas

height="0.21875in"} is the spatial correlation matrix at the UE with
same polarization,

\- ![](./media/image89.wmf){width="0.3125in" height="0.3125in"} is the
spatial correlation matrix at the gNB with same polarization,

J.3 High speed train condition
==============================

The applicable models for high speed train conditions are as follows:

\- Scenario 1-NR350 / Scenario 1-NR500: Open space

\- Scenario 3-NR350 / Scenario 3-NR500: Tunnel

\- Scenario 4-BI-NR350, FR2: Open space

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance
are three non-fading propagation channels. The Doppler shift varies with
time as described below. For BS with Rx diversity, the Doppler shift
time variation is the same for each antenna at each time instant.

For all three scenarios, the Doppler shift is given by:

(J.3.1)

where is the Doppler shift and is the maximum Doppler frequency.

For Scenario 1 and Scenario 3, the cosine of angle is given by:

, (J.3.2)

, (J.3.3)

, (J.3.4)

where is the initial distance in metres of the train from BS, and is the
perpendicular distance in metres from the BS to the railway track, is
the velocity of the train in m/s, is time in seconds.

For Sceanrio 4, the cosine of angle $\theta\left( t \right)$ is given
by:

$\cos{\theta\left( t \right)} = \frac{D_{s} - \text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\min}^{2} + \left( D_{s} - \text{vt} \right)^{2}}},\ \ \ \ 0 < t \leq {(0.5*D}_{s})/v$
(J.3.5)

$\cos{\theta\left( t \right)} = - \frac{\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\min}^{2} + \left( \text{vt} \right)^{2}}},\ \ \ {(0.5*D}_{s})/v < t \leq D_{s}/v$
(J.3.6)

$\cos{\theta\left( t \right)} = \text{cosθ}\left( t\ \text{mod}\left( \frac{D_{s}}{v} \right) \right),\ \ \ \ t > D_{s}/v$
(J.3.7)

where $D_{s}$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\min}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s; $t$ is time in seconds.

The required input parameters are listed in table J.3-1 and J.3-2. The
resulting time varying Doppler shift is shown in Figure J.3-1, J.3-2,
J.3-3, J.3-4, and J.3-9 for 350 km/h scenarios, and in Figure J.3-5,
J.3-6, J.3-7 and J.3-8 for 500 km/h scenarios. For 350 km/h scenarios,
the Doppler shift was derived such that it corresponds to a velocity of
around 350 km/h for band n1 for the 15 KHz SCS, for band n77 for the 30
KHz SCS, and for band n257 for the 120 KHz SCS. For 500 km/h scenarios,
the Doppler shift was derived such that it corresponds to a velocity of
around 500 km/h for band n3 for the 15 KHz SCS, and for band n77 for the
30 KHz SCS. However, the same Doppler shift requirement shall be applied
regardless of the frequency of operation of the base station and thus
for lower frequencies, the supported speed is higher.

J.4 Moving propagation conditions
=================================

Figure J.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test
of the UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the
reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (J.4-1). The
timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ -
(*T~A~* −31)×16×64*T~c~* for 15 KHz SCS, Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×32*T~c~*
for 30 KHz SCS and Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×8*T~c~* for 120 KHz SCS. The
relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table J.4-1.

######## Annex K (informative): Measuring noise close to noise-floor

As the emission level seen by the measurement receiver (*P~UEM~*) for
co-location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure
relative noise change instead of absolute noise level. For the situation
where the noise level is stable, the noise level change can be
identified by a relative noise measurement method. This method measures
the relative noise change extracted from when the test object is
operating and when the power is disconnected. From the two measured
noise levels the relative noise change can be determined. The relations
between measured noise change *δ~1~*, noise floor N~0~ and the relation
to *P~UEM~* with respect to the noise floor denoted *δ~2~* is visualized
in the left drawing in figure K-1.

![](./media/image154.emf){width="2.75in" height="1.5104166666666667in"}
![](./media/image155.png){width="2.8958333333333335in"
height="2.1770833333333335in"}

Figure K-1: Relative noise measurement

The absolute emission level in decibel scale is determined from a
relative measurement of *δ~1\ ~*as:

$P_{\text{UEM}} = N_{0} - \delta_{2}$

where *N~0~* is the noise floor of the measurement receiver and *δ~2~*
is plotted as function of *δ~1~* at the right in figure K-1. The
absolute noise floor of the measurement receiver, including probe
antenna, cables, filter and LNA is determined by a calibration
procedure. The calibration will determine the absolute emission level
(*N~0~*) accuracy of measuring out-of-band unwanted emission close to
the thermal noise floor.

######## Annex L (normative): In-channel TX tests

L.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the In-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

L.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a TDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 120 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 400
MHz (*N*~RB~ = 264). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

L.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a
sampling rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it
is named $z\left( \upsilon \right)$.

For FR1, *FFT size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in
TS 38.141-1 \[3\] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30
kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

For FR2, *FFT size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5.2‑3 for 120 kHz SCS, table
6.6.3.5.2-4 for 480 kHz SCS and table 6.6.3.5.2-5 for 960 kHz SCS. In
the time domain it comprises at least 10 ms for FR1 and FR2-1 and at
least 80 slots for FR2-2. It is modelled as a signal with the following
parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.6.3.5.2-3. The sampling rate of 491.52 Msps is the product of the *FFT
size* and SCS.

L.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex L.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters for FR1 and FR2:

\- nominal demodulation reference signal and nominal PT-RS if present
(all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex L.2.1 in the time domain.

L.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency error.

\- EVM.

\- Resource element TX power.

\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP).

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

L.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described
in figure L.2.4-1 for FR1 and in figure L.2.4.2. The EVM shall be
measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in
the receiver, as depicted in for FR1 in figure L.2.4-1 and for FR2 in
figure L.2.4-2. The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT size*
+ cyclic prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in the
\"Remove CP\" box.

For FR1, The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from
TS 38.141-1 \[3\] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30
kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

For FR2, *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length is determined from
table 6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5.2‑3 for 120 kHz SCS,
table 6.6.3.5.2-4 for 480 kHz SCS and table 6.6.3.5.2-5 for 960 kHz SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in TS 38.141-1 \[3\] tables
6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and 6.5.3.5-4 for FR1 and tables 6.6.3.5.2-2, table
6.6.3.5.2-3, table 6.6.3.5.2-4 and table 6.6.3.5.2-5 for FR2. Table
L.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and the formula how
to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two symbols according
to the sampling rate.

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4 has 256 more
samples in the cyclic prefix than the other symbols (the longer CP
length = 544).

L.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample timing, carrier frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are
varied in order to minimise the difference between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the
amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples inbetween the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinuish between both.

After this process the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.

L.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD,
there are $14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs performed where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of
symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14. For TDD, the number of FFTs
performed is the number of downlink symbols in the measurement interval.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 832 FFTs (i.e. 3,407,872 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 3,651,584 samples in 10 ms). There are
816 symbols with 4384 samples and 16 symbols with 4640 samples.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2$, and

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2$.

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from the transmission
bandwidth and TS 38.141-1 \[3\] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table
6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS for FR1, and
table 6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5.2-3 for 120 kHz SCS,
table 6.6.3.5.2-4 for 480 kHz SCS and table 6.6.3.5.2-5 for 960 kHz SCS
for FR2.

The BS shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended for
EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal shall
be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre FFT domain as
follows, using $z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$:

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$, the timing is
known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is a Dirac peak and
that the correlation between the ideal signal
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and the data in the measured signal is 0.
The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest,
the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$. This subset of samples is called
$z'\left( \upsilon \right)$.

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ is determined
according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal
CP, there are two values for $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ in a 1 ms
period:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = length of cyclic prefix / 2,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = Longer CP length - length of cyclic
prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from TS 38.141-1 \[3\]
table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table
6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS for FR1, and table 6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS,
table 6.6.3.5.2-3 for 120 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5.2-4 for 480 kHz SCS and
table 6.6.3.5.2-5 for 960 kHz SCS for FR2, and the longer CP length is
obtained from table L.2.4-1.

As per the example values.

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 144$ within the CP of length 288 for
most OFDM symbols in 1 ms,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 400$ (= 544 -- 144) within the CP of
length 544 for OFDM symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4.

L.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on $z'\left( \nu \right)$ with the FFT window timing
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$.

The result is called $Z'\left( t,f \right)$. The RE TX (RETP) power is
then defined as:

$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$

where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP, the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$$\text{OSTP} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}\sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$

Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
values of all *N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not containing
PDCCH, RS or SSB within a slot.

$\ N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}} = 12$.

From the acquired samples $N_{\text{dl}}$ values for each OSTP can be
obtained and averaged where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval for FDD. For TDD, $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots with downlink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval
for FR1 and FR2-1, in an 80 slots measurement interval for FR2-2 and is
computed according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1.

For the example used in the annex, $N_{\text{dl}} = 64$ and
$N_{\text{RB}} = 264$.

L.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform $14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs on $z'\left( \nu \right)$, one for each
OFDM symbol within 10 ms for FR1 and FR2-1, and 80 slots measurement
interval for FR2-2 measurement interval with the FFT window timing to
produce an array of samples, $14N_{\text{dl}}$ in the time axis *t* by
*FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 1120 FFTs are performed on
$z'\left( \nu \right)$. The result is an array of samples, 1120 in the
time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$ and
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ and the post-FFT ideal signal
$I_{2}\left( t,f \right)$, for each demodulation reference signal, over
10 ms measurement interval for FR1 and FR2-1, and 80 slots measurement
interval for FR2-2. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

$a\left( t,f \right)e^{\text{jφ}\left( t,f \right)} = \frac{Z'\left( t,f \right)}{I_{2}\left( t,f \right)}$

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval for FR1 and FR2-1, and 80 slots measurement
interval for FR2-2. Prior to the averaging of the phases
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of 2 \* π when
absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances $t_{i}$ are
greater then or equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

$a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$

$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$

Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signal time-domain
locations $t_{i}$ from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation
reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)\ $ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$
at the demodulation reference signal subcarriers are obtained by
computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged demodulation reference signal subcarriers. The moving
average window size is 19 and averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in
the allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the edge of the
channel, or when the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within a set
of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than the moving average window
size, the window size is reduced accordingly as per figure L.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to
compute coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$,
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ for each subcarrier.

Figure L.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain

a\) In case of FR2 EVM, to account for the common phase error (CPE)
experienced in millimetre wave frequencies, $\overline{\varphi}(f)$, in
the estimated coefficients contain phase rotation due to the CPE,
$\theta$, in addition to the phase of the equalizer coefficient
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$, that is:

$\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) + \theta(t)$

For OFDM symbols where PT-RS does not exist, $\theta(t)$ can be
estimated by performing linear interpolation from neighboring symbols
where PT-RS is present.

In order to separate component of the CPE,$\text{\ θ}$, contained in,
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$, estimation and compensation of the CPE needs to
follow.$\ \theta(t)$ is the common phase error (CPE), that rotates all
the subcarriers of the OFDM symbol at time $t$.

Estimate of the CPE, $\theta(t)$, at OFDM symbol time, $t$, can then be
obtained from using the PT-RS employing the expression:

$\widetilde{\theta}(t) = \arg\left\{ \sum_{{f \in f}^{\text{ptrs}}}^{}\left( \frac{Z^{'}\left( t,f \right)}{I_{\text{ptrs}}\left( t,f \right)} \right)\ \left( \widetilde{a}\left( f \right)e^{- j\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right)} \right) \right\}$

In the above equation, $f^{\text{ptrs}}$ is the set of subcarriers where
PT-RS are mapped, ${t \in t}^{\text{ptrs}}$ where $t^{\text{ptrs}}$ is
the set of OFDM symbols where PT-RS are mapped while
$Z^{'}\left( t,f \right)$ and $I_{\text{ptrs}}\left( t,f \right)$ are is
the post-FFT acquired signal and the ideal PT-RS signal respectively.
That is, estimate of the CPE at a given OFDM symbol is obtained from
frequency correlation of the complex ratios at the PT-RS positions with
the conjugate of the estimated equalizer complex coefficients. The
estimated CPE can be subtracted from
$\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to remove influence of the CPE, and
obtain estimate of the complex coefficient\'s phase:

$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \overline{\varphi}\left( f \right) - \widetilde{\theta}$(t)

L.7 EVM
=======

L.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according
to the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer
coefficients from L.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ (annex L.2.2) and are called
$I\left( t,f \right)$.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$

Where:

\- *T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

\- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource
blocks with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

\- $I\left( t,f \right)$ *is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,

\- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under
test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval for FR1 and
FR2-1, and over the entire 80 slots measurement interval for FR2-2 to
reduce the impact of noise in the reference signals.

L.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
------------------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ downlink slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of
slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

The averaging in the time domain equals the $N_{\text{dl}}$ slot
duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation
step.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in subframe *i*.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ in the expressions
above and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ in the
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ calculation where (*l* and *h*,
low and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

Thus:

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.

L.7.2 Averaged EVM (TDD) for FR1 and FR2-1
------------------------------------------

Let $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with downlink
symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For TDD, the averaging in
the time domain can be calculated from $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$
slots of different 10 ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum
of $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots averaging length where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM
results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the
sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient
(RMS).

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated
using$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*,
low and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the minimum
integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{\text{frame}}$
is determined by

$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$

And for FR1, $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$
for 30 kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP. For
FR2, $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 8$ for
120 kHz SCS.

Unite by RMS.

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$is compared against the limit.

L.7.3 Averaged EVM (TDD) for FR2-2
----------------------------------

Let $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with downlink
symbols within a 80 slots measurement interval. For TDD, the averaging
in the time domain can be calculated from $N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}$
slots of different measurement intervals and should have a minimum of 80
slots averaging length for FR2-2.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{80slots\_ period}$ is derived by: Square the
EVM results in each one measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide
the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{80slots\_ period}\  = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The $\text{EVM}_{80slots\_ period}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{80slots\_ period}$ at the window *W*
extremities. Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{80slots\_ period,l}$ is
calculated using $\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$
and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{80slots\_ period,h}$ is calculated
using$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*,
low and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$\text{EVM}_{80slots\_ period} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{80slots\_ period,l},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{80slots\_ period,h} \right)$

In order to unite at least 80 slots, consider the minimum integer number
of 80 slots measurement intervals, where $N_{80slots\_ period}$ is
determined by

$N_{80slots\_ period} = \left\lceil \frac{80}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$

Unite by RMS.

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{80slots\_ period}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{80slots\_ period}}\text{EVM}_{80slots\_ period,k}^{2}}$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$is compared against the limit.

M.1.1 General
-------------

The test framework for the 0.001% BLER test is based upon examining
received blocks and determining pass, fail or continue each time a block
error occurs.

The pass/fail decision is made based on so-called decision co-ordinates
(ne, ns). ne is the number of block errors encountered during the test
and ns is the total number of received blocks during the test, up to the
current block error. The ns is compared with the nsp and nsf entries
corresponding to ne in table M.1.1-1. If ns is greater than the nsp
value in M.1.1-1, a pass may be declared. If ns is lower than the nsf
value, a fail may be declared. Otherwise, the test continues.

The objective of the approach is to minimize testing time and the basis
of the approach is an early termination statistical framework described
in clause M.1.3.1. The minimum testing time is defined by the possible
decision coordinates detailed in clause M.1.2.

As with all statistical tests, there is a non-zero risk of the test
result being incorrect due to statistical variations. There are two
possibilities for an incorrect decision:

\- As BS, whose BLER is greater than the requirement (i.e., the BS does
not comply to the requirement), is declared to pass the test.

\- A BS, whose BLER is lower than the requirement (i.e., a BS that does
comply to the requirement), is declared to fail the test.

The outcome of the statistical test is a decision. This decision may be
correct with confidence level of 99.999%, i.e., BSs whose BLER is
greater than 0.001% being declared to fail, and BSs whose BLER is
smaller or equal to 0.001% being declared to pass, or in-correct (as
detailed above).

M.1.3 Theory to derive the early pass/fail limits in M.1.2 (informative)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### M.1.3.1 Numerical definition of the pass-fail limits for testing PUSCH 0.001% BLER

A statistical test is characterized by test time, selectivity and
confidence level. The outcome of the statistical test is a decision.
This decision may be correct, i.e., BSs whose BLER is greater than
0.001% being declared to fail, and BSs whose BLER is smaller or equal to
0.001% being declared to pass, or in-correct (as detailed above). The
Confidence Level (CL) describes the probability that the decision is a
correct one. The complement is the wrong decision probability (risk) D =
1-CL.

When testing BLER, transport blocks or \"samples\" are observed and the
numbers of correctly and erroneously received blocks are recorded. For a
\"standard\" test, a pre-defined number of samples are observed, and a
pass/fail decision is made based on the number of observed errors being
above/below a threshold. This threshold is based on the targeted BLER
and the design target CL. There is always some risk of a statistical
variation leading to an incorrect pass/fail decision. The greater the
number of samples that are recorded, the lower is the risk of such an
error. The number of samples that are observed in a standard test is
dimensioned to achieve an acceptable low risk of error (i.e., an
acceptable high confidence level) for BS that just meet the BLER limit.

The standard test works well where the BLER level is relatively high and
confidence level relatively low (both are chosen to be on a comparable
order of magnitude). However, for ultra-low BLER testing the length of
time required for observing sufficient samples to achieve a 99.999%
confidence level is excessive. In many cases, the BS will in fact have a
much lower true BLER than the limit, i.e., design target of the test,
(in which case, the number of samples needed to achieve high confidence
that the BLER is lower than the limit is much smaller) or, if failing
the requirement will have a much higher true BLER (in which case, errors
occur more frequently and it can be demonstrated that the BS is above
the BLER limit with fewer samples).

To avoid long test times, an alternative test method called early
pass/fail is adopted. With the early pass/fail, each time a block error
is encountered, a decision is made on whether the BS can be
passed/failed with 99.999% CL or the test needs to continue until
another error is encountered. In the case of very good BSs, the test can
also be passed, when the number of samples permissible for one error
event is reached and no error event is recorded. Pass/Fail is decided
based on the total number of observed samples and errors, and a
statistical calculation based on an inverse binomial cumulative
distribution. The calculation involves one parameter, one variable and
the result:

\- Parameter: d (per step decision probability).

\- Variable: ne (number of observed errors).

\- Result: ns (number of expected samples for pass/fail, depending on
which one is calculated).

The per step decision probability risk, d, expresses the probability of
making an incorrect pass/fail decision in the current step (i.e., for
the current decision coordinate). d is determined by simulation such
that the overall risk of making a wrong decision over all steps of each
test of a large number of tests on a large number of BSs that exactly
meet the BLER limit is D=0.001% (and hence the CL 99.999%).

It should be noted that d is determined separately considering early
pass and early fail testing.

For a marginal BS (i.e., a BS almost exactly meeting the BLER), the
unmodified early pass/early fail approach is unable to distinguish
whether the BS has just passed or just failed the BLER (ε→0), and can
thus terminate with an \"undecided\" result. To avoid this undecided
result and provide selectivity, a so-called \"bad device factor\" (M) is
introduced into the early pass calculation. This factor biases the
decision towards avoiding failing good BS.

### M.1.3.2 Simulation to derive the pass-fail limits for testing PUSCH 0.001% BLER

There is freedom to design the decision co-ordinates (ne, ns), as
captured in clause M.1.2.

The binomial distribution and its inverse are used to design the pass
and fail limits. Note that this method is not unique and that other
methods exist.

Where

\- fail(..) is the error ratio for the fail limit.

\- pass(..) is the error ratio for the pass limit.

\- ER is the specified error ratio 1e-5.

\- ne is the number of bad results. This is the variable in both
equations.

\- M is the Bad EUT factor M=1.5.

\- d~f~ is the wrong decision probability of a single (ne, ns)
co-ordinate for the fail limit.\
It is found by simulation to be d~f~ = 2e-7.

\- cl~p~ is the confidence level of a single (ne, ns) co-ordinate for
the pass limit.\
It is found by simulation to be cl~p~ = 0.9999999.

\- qnbinom(..): The inverse cumulative function of the negative binomial
distribution.

The simulation works as follows:

\- A large population of limit EUTs with true ER = 1e-5 is decided
against the pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (99.999 %) of the population
passes and D (0.001 %) of the population fails.

\- A population of Bad EUTs with true ER = M\*1e-5 is decided against
the same pass and fail limits.

\- cl~p~ and d~f~ are tuned such that CL (99.999 %) of the population
fails and D (0.001 %) of the population passes.

\- The number of EUTs decrease during the simulation, as the decided
EUTs leave the population. That number decreases with an approximately
exponential characteristics. After 642 bad results all EUTs of the
population are decided.

NOTE: The exponential decrease of the population is an optimal design
goal for the decision co-ordinates (ne, ns), which can be achieved with
other formulas or methods as well.
