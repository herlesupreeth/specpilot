##### 9.1.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.4.1.2.2.3, 5.4.1.2.2.4, 5.4.1.2.2.6B,
5.4.1.2.2.8.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.6B (TP1)\]

Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with
EAP-Request/Identity message the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION
RESPONSE message with EAP-Response/Identity to the network. In the
EAP-Response/Identity message, the UE shall provide the requested
identity according to 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\] annex F.2, in the UE
identity in the EAP-Response/Identity message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with
EAP-Request/AKA\'-Identity message the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION
RESPONSE message with EAP-Response/AKA\'-Identity to the network. Based
on the attribute received in the EAP-Request/AKA\'-Identity, the UE
shall provide the requested identity according to 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]
annex F.2, in the EAP-Response/AKA\'-Identity message, as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

If the EAP-Request/AKA\'-Identity carries the AT\_PERMANENT\_REQ, the UE
shall respond with EAP-Response/AKA\'-Client-Error with the error code
\"unable to process packet\".

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.4 (TP2)\]

If a USIM is present, the SNN check fails or the UE does not accept AUTN
during handling of the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified
in IETF RFC 5448 \[40\], the UE shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-authentication-reject message as specified in IETF
RFC 5448 \[40\].

If a USIM is present, the SNN check is successful but the UE detects
that the sequence number in AUTN is not correct during handling of the
EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
\[40\], the UE shall send an EAP-response/AKA\'-synchronization-failure
message as specified in IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

If a USIM is present, the SNN check is successful, the sequence number
in AUTN is correct and the UE detects another error during handling of
the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
\[40\], the UE shall send an EAP-response/AKA\'-client-error message as
specified in IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

If a USIM is not present, the UE shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-client-error message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
\[40\].

For any of the above, the UE shall start timer T3520 when the
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAP-response message is
sent. Furthermore, the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers
that are running (e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521). Upon receiving an
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an
EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge from the network, the UE shall stop timer
T3520, if running, and then process the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge
information as normal.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.3 (TP3)\]

If a USIM is present and the SNN check is successful, the UE shall
handle the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC
5448 \[40\]. The USIM shall derive CK and IK and compute the
authentication response (RES) using the 5G authentication challenge data
received from the ME, and pass RES to the ME. The ME shall derive CK\'
and IK\' from CK and IK, and EMSK from CK\' and IK\'. Furthermore, the
ME may generate K~AUSF~ from the EMSK, the K~SEAF~ from the K~AUSF~, and
the K~AMF~ from the ABBA received together with the
EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message, and the K~SEAF~ as described in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\], and create a partial native 5G NAS security
context identified by the ngKSI value received together with the
EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message in clause 5.4.1.2.4.2 in the
volatile memory of the ME. If the K~AMF~ and the partial native 5G NAS
security context are created, the ME shall store the K~AMF~ in the
created partial native 5G NAS security context, and shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
\[40\].

If the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message contains AT\_RESULT\_IND
attribute, the UE may include AT\_RESULT\_IND attribute in the
EAP-response/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in IETF RFC 5448
\[40\].

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.8 (TP4)\]

Upon receiving an EAP-success message, if the ME has not generated a
partial native 5G NAS security context as described in subclause
5.4.1.2.2.3, the ME shall:

a\) generate the K~AUSF~ from the EMSK, the K~SEAF~ from the K~AUSF~,
and the K~AMF~ from the ABBA that was received with the EAP-success
message, and the K~SEAF~ as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\];

b\) create a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the
ngKSI value in the volatile memory of the ME; and

c\) store the K~AMF~ in the created partial native 5G NAS security
context.

The UE shall consider the procedure complete.

##### 9.1.1.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-1 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.4.1.2.2.4, 5.4.1.2.2.6, and
5.4.1.2.2.11.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.4\]

If a USIM is present, the SNN check fails or the UE does not accept AUTN
during handling of the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified
in IETF RFC 5448 \[40\], the UE shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-authentication-reject message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

If a USIM is present, the SNN check is successful but the UE detects
that the sequence number in AUTN is not correct during handling of the
EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\], the UE shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-synchronization-failure message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

If a USIM is present, the SNN check is successful, the sequence number
in AUTN is correct and the UE detects another error during handling of
the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\], the UE shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-client-error message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

If a USIM is not present, the UE shall send an
EAP-response/AKA\'-client-error message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

For any of the above, the UE shall start timer T3520 when the
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAP-response message is
sent. Furthermore, the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers
that are running (e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521). Upon receiving an
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an
EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge from the network, the UE shall stop timer
T3520, if running, and then process the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge
information as normal.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.6\]

Upon receiving an EAP-request/AKA\'-notification message, the UE shall
send an EAP-response/AKA\'-notification message as specified in
IETF RFC 5448 \[40\].

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.11\]

Upon receiving an EAP-failure message, the UE shall delete the partial
native 5G NAS security context if any was created as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.2.3.

The UE shall consider the procedure complete.

If the EAP-failure message is received in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT
message:

\- the UE shall set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete
the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and ngKSI. The
USIM shall be considered invalid until switching off the UE or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed; and

\- if the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall
handle 4G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the case when the authentication
procedure is not accepted by the network. The USIM shall be considered
as invalid also for non-EPS services until switching off or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed.

If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the UE, the UE shall
abort any 5GMM signalling procedure, stop any of the timers T3510, T3517
or T3521 (if they were running) and enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

##### 9.1.1.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-2 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.4.1.2.4.5. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.4.5 (TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4, TP5)\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) Authentication failure (5GMM cause \#71 \"ngKSI already in use\").

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with 5GMM cause
\#71 \"ngKSI already in use\", to the network and start the timer T3520
(see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1). Furthermore, the UE shall stop any
of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3510, T3517 or
T3521). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from
the UE with 5GMM cause \#71 \"ngKSI already in use\", the network
performs necessary actions to select a new ngKSI and send the same
EAP-request message to the UE.

NOTE 1: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE
with 5GMM cause \#71 \"ngKSI already in use\", the network can also
re-initiate the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure (see subclause 5.4.1.2.2.2).

Upon receiving a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message
IE containing an EAP-request message from the network, the UE shall stop
timer T3520, if running, process the EAP-request message as normal.

If the network is validated successfully (an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message that contains a valid ngKSI and EAP-request message is
received), the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the
network and shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3510, T3517 or
T3521) if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first
failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

b\) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication from lower layers (if the EAP
based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is triggered by
a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update).

The UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running, and re-initiate the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update.

c\) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication with TAI change from lower
layers (if the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure is triggered by a service request procedure).

The UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running.

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the EAP based primary
authentication and key agreement procedure shall be aborted and a
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
shall be initiated.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the
EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.

...

e\) Network failing the authentication check.

If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check,
then it shall request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and
treat the active cell as barred (see 3GPP TS 38.304 \[28\]). The UE
shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521), if
they were running and stopped when the UE received the first
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an ngKSI that was already in
use.

For item e, whether or not the UE is registered for emergency services:

The UE shall stop timer T3520, if the timer is running and the UE enters
5GMM-IDLE mode, e.g. upon detection of a lower layer failure, release of
the N1 NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an inter-system
change in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode.

The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check
or assume that the authentication is not genuine and proceed as
described in item e above if any of the following occurs:

\- the timer T3520 expires;

\- the UE detects any combination of the EAP-based authentication
failures: transmission of AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause
\#71 \"ngKSI already in use\", transmission of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE
message with an EAP-response message after detecting an error as
described in subclause 5.4.1.2.2.4 or with an EAP-response message after
not accepting of the server certificate as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.3.1, during three consecutive authentication
challenges. The EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge challenges shall be
considered as consecutive only, if the EAP-request/AKA\'-challenge
challenges causing the second and third EAP-based authentication failure
are received by the UE, while the timer T3520 started after the previous
EAP-based authentication failure is running. Not accepting of the server
certificate shall be considered as consecutive only, if the EAP-request
messages causing the second and third not accepting of the server
certificate are received by the UE, while the timer T3520 started after
the previous EAP request message causing the previous not accepting of
the server certificate is running.

NOTE 2: Reception of an EAP-failure message is not considered when
determining the three consecutive authentication challenges or three
consecutive not accepting of the server certificate.

##### 9.1.1.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-3 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.4.1.3.3, 5.4.1.3.6, 5.4.1.3.7. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.3.3\]

The UE shall respond to an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. With the
exception of the cases described in subclause 5.4.1.3.5, the UE shall
process the 5G authentication challenge data and respond with an
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network.

Upon a successful 5G authentication challenge, the new K~AMF~ calculated
from the 5G authentication challenge data shall be stored in a new 5G
NAS security context in the volatile memory of the ME.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.3.6\]

In the 5G authentication challenge, the UE shall check the 5G
authentication challenge data (RAND, AUTN and ngKSI) received in the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to verify authenticity of the 5G core
network.

The ME shall check that ngKSI received in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message is not already in use. The ME shall forward the RAND and AUTN to
the USIM to check.

The UE may reject the core network due to an incorrect AUTN or ngKSI
parameter. If the UE has to reject the 5G authentication challenge, the
UE shall return AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network with a
cause value indicating the reason for the failure (see
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]).

Incorrect 5G authentication challenge data contains four possible causes
for authentication failure:

a\) MAC code failure:

If the UE finds the MAC code (supplied by the core network in the AUTN
parameter) to be invalid, the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
message to the network, with the 5GMM cause \#20 \"MAC failure\". The UE
shall then follow the procedure described in subclause 5.4.1.3.7, item
c.

b\) Non-5G authentication unacceptable:

If the UE finds that the \"separation bit\" in the AMF field of AUTN
supplied by the core network is set to 0, the UE shall send an
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the 5GMM cause \#26
\"non-5G authentication unacceptable\" (see subclause 6.1.3 in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]). The UE shall then follow the procedure described
in subclause 5.4.1.3.7, item d.

\...

d\) SQN failure:

If the UE finds the sequence number SQN (supplied by the core network in
the AUTN parameter) to be out of range, the UE shall send an
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the 5GMM cause \#21
\"synch failure\" and a re-synchronization token AUTS provided by the
USIM (see 3GPP TS 33.102 \[23\]). The UE shall then follow the procedure
described in subclause 5.4.1.3.7, item f.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.3.7\]

c\) Authentication failure (5GMM cause \#20 \"MAC failure\").

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with 5GMM cause
\#20 \"MAC failure\" according to subclause 5.4.1.3.6, to the network
and start timer T3520 (see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1). Furthermore,
the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running
(e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521). Upon the first receipt of an
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause \#20 \"MAC
failure\", the network may initiate the identification procedure
described in subclause 5.4.3. This is to allow the network to obtain the
SUCI from the UE. The network may then check that the 5G-GUTI originally
used in the 5G authentication challenge corresponded to the correct
SUPI. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network, the
UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.4.3.3.

NOTE 1: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE
with 5GMM cause \#20 \"MAC failure\", the network may also terminate the
5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure (see
subclause 5.4.1.3.5).

If the mapping of 5G-GUTI to SUPI in the network was incorrect, the
network should respond by sending a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message
to the UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message from
the network, the UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running, and then
process the 5G challenge information as normal. If the mapping of
5G-GUTI to SUPI in the network was correct, the network should terminate
the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure by
sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message (see subclause 5.4.1.3.5).

If the network is validated successfully (an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message that contains a valid SQN and MAC is received), the UE shall
send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start
any retransmission timers (e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521) if they were
running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message.

If the UE receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, and the
MAC value cannot be resolved, the UE shall follow the procedure
specified in this subclause, item c, starting again from the beginning,
or if the message contains a UMTS authentication challenge, the UE shall
follow the procedure specified in item d. If the SQN is invalid, the UE
shall proceed as specified in item f.

Figure 5.4.1.3.7.1: Authentication failure during 5G AKA based primary
authentication and key agreement procedure

d\) Authentication failure (5GMM cause \#26 \"non-5G authentication
unacceptable\").

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with 5GMM cause
\#26 \"non-5G authentication unacceptable\", to the network and start
the timer T3520 (see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1). Furthermore, the UE
shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g.
T3510, T3517 or T3521). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION
FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause \#26 \"non-5G authentication
unacceptable\", the network may initiate the identification procedure
described in subclause 5.4.3. This is to allow the network to obtain the
SUCI from the UE. The network may then check that the 5G-GUTI originally
used in the 5G authentication challenge corresponded to the correct
SUPI. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network, the
UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.4.3.3.

NOTE 2: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE
with 5GMM cause \#26 \"non-5G authentication unacceptable\", the network
may also terminate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure (see subclause 5.4.1.3.5).

If the mapping of 5G-GUTI to SUPI in the network was incorrect, the
network should respond by sending a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message
to the UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message from
the network, the UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running, and then
process the 5G challenge information as normal. If the mapping of
5G-GUTI to SUPI in the network was correct, the network should terminate
the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement authentication
procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message (see
subclause 5.4.1.3.5).

\...

f\) Authentication failure (5GMM cause \#21 \"synch failure\").

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with 5GMM cause
\#21 \"synch failure\", to the network and start the timer T3520 (see
example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1). Furthermore, the UE shall stop any of
the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521).
Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE
with the 5GMM cause \#21 \"synch failure\", the network shall use the
returned AUTS parameter from the authentication failure parameter IE in
the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, to re-synchronise. The
re-synchronisation procedure requires the AMF to delete all unused
authentication vectors for that SUPI and obtain new vectors from the
UDM/AUSF. When re-synchronisation is complete, the network shall
initiate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure. Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the UE
shall stop the timer T3520, if running.

NOTE 4: Upon receipt of two consecutive AUTHENTICATION FAILURE messages
from the UE with 5GMM cause \#21 \"synch failure\", the network may
terminate the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message.

If the network is validated successfully (a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message is received which contains a valid SQN and MAC) while T3520 is
running, the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the
network and shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3510, T3517 or
T3521), if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first
failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the UE shall perform
the actions as specified in subclause 5.4.1.3.5.

##### (1) {#section-17 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED state and SS initiates a
5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the SS sends an a AUTHENTICATION REJECT message }

**then** { the UE deletes the stored 5G-GUTI, last visited registered
TAI and ngKSI and enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the USIM is considered
invalid until switching off the UE. }

}

##### 9.1.1.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-4 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.4.1.3.5. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.3.5\]

If the authentication response (RES) returned by the UE is not valid,
the network response depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in
the initial NAS message, that is:

\- if the 5G-GUTI was used; or

\- if the SUCI was used.

If the 5G-GUTI was used, the network should initiate an identification
procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the 5G AKA based
primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received
SUCI.

If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in
a restarted 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure, or the network decides not to initiate the identification
procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful 5G AKA
based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the network
should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message,

1\) if the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS,
the UE shall set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete
the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and ngKSI.

In case of PLMN, the USIM shall be considered invalid until switching
off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. In case of SNPN,
the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of
the current SNPN shall be considered invalid until the UE is switched
off or the entry is updated.

\- The UE shall set:

i\) the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\"
events and the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for 5GS
services over non-3GPP access\" events in case of PLMN; or

ii\) the counter for \"the entry for the current SNPN considered invalid
for 3GPP access\" events in case of SNPN;

to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If the UE maintains a
counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services\", then
the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum
value; and

\- if the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall
handle 4G-GUTI, TAI list and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]
for the case when the authentication procedure is not accepted by the
network. The USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-EPS
services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

2\) if the message is received without integrity protection, the UE
shall start timer T3247 with a random value uniformly drawn from the
range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running
(see subclause 5.3.20). Additionally, the UE shall:

a\) if the message is received over 3GPP access, and the counter for
\"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\" events or the counter
for \"the entry for the current SNPN considered invalid for 3GPP
access\" events has a value less than a UE implementation-specific
maximum value, proceed as specified in subclause 5.3.20, list item 1)-a)
of clause 5.3.20.2 (if the UE is not SNPN enabled or is not operating in
SNPN access mode) or list item a) of clause 5.30.20.3 (if the UE is
operating in SNPN access mode) for the case that the 5GMM cause value
received is \#3;

b\) if the message is received over non-3GPP access, and the counter for
\"SIM/USIM considered invalid for 5GS services over non-3GPP access\"
events has a value less than a UE implementation-specific maximum value,
proceed as specified in subclause 5.3.20, list item 1)-b) of
clause 5.3.20.2 for the case that the 5GMM cause value received is \#3.

c\) otherwise

i\) if the 5GMM cause value is received over 3GPP access, the UE shall:

\- set the update status for 3GPP access to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED,
delete for 3GPP access only the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited
registered TAI and ngKSI. The USIM shall be considered invalid for 5GS
services via 3GPP access and non-EPS service until switching off the UE
or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current SNPN shall be
considered invalid for 3GPP access until the UE is switched off or the
entry is updated.

\- The UE shall set the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for
GPRS services\" events or the counter for \"the entry for the current
SNPN considered invalid for 3GPP access\" events to UE
implementation-specific maximum value. If the UE maintains a counter for
\"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services\", then the UE shall
set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

\- If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall
handle 4G-GUTI, TAI list and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]
for the case when the authentication procedure is not accepted by the
network. The USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-EPS
services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed;
and

ii\) if the 5GMM cause value is received over non-3GPP access, the UE
shall:

\- set the update status for non-3GPP access to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED,
delete for non-3GPP access only the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last
visited registered TAI and ngKSI. The USIM shall be considered invalid
for 5GS services via non-3GPP access until switching off the UE or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed.

The UE shall set the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for 5GS
services over non-3GPP access\" events to UE implementation-specific
maximum value.

If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the UE, the UE shall
abort any 5GMM signalling procedure, stop any of the timers T3510,
T3516, T3517, T3519 or T3521 (if they were running), enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED and delete any stored SUCI.

Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency
services, if the UE initiates a registration procedure with 5GS
registration type IE set to \"emergency registration\" and the AMF is
configured to allow emergency registration without user identity, the
AMF needs not follow the procedures specified for the authentication
failure in the present subclause. The AMF may continue a current 5GMM
specific procedure.

##### 9.1.1.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-5 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.4.1.3.7. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.3.7\]

e\) Authentication failure (5GMM cause \#71 \"ngKSI already in use\").

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with 5GMM cause
\#71 \"ngKSI already in use\", to the network and start the timer T3520
(see example in figure 5.4.1.3.7.1). Furthermore, the UE shall stop any
of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3510, T3517 or
T3521). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from
the UE with 5GMM cause \#71 \"ngKSI already in use\", the network
performs necessary actions to select a new ngKSI and send the same 5G
authentication challenge to the UE.

...

g\) Network failing the authentication check.

If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check,
then it shall request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and
treat the active cell as barred (see 3GPP TS 38.304 \[28\]). The UE
shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3510, T3517 or T3521), if
they were running and stopped when the UE received the first
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an incorrect authentication
challenge data causing authentication failure.

h\) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication from lower layers (if the 5G
AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is
triggered by a registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update).

The UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running, and re-initiate the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update.

...

i\) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication with TAI change from lower
layers (if the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure is triggered by a service request procedure).

The UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running.

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the 5G AKA based primary
authentication and key agreement procedure shall be aborted and a
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
shall be initiated.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the 5G
AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.

...

For items c, d, e, and f whether or not the UE is registered for
emergency services:

...

The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check
or assume that the authentication is not genuine and proceed as
described in item g above if any of the following occurs:

\- the timer T3520 expires;

\- the UE detects any combination of the 5G authentication failures:
5GMM causes \#20 \"MAC failure\", \#21 \"synch failure\", \#26 \"non-5G
authentication unacceptable\" or \#71 \"ngKSI already in use\", during
three consecutive authentication challenges. The 5G authentication
challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the 5G
authentication challenges causing the second and third 5G authentication
failure are received by the UE, while the timer T3520 started after the
previous 5G authentication failure is running.

##### 9.1.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-6 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.4.2.1, 5.4.2.3 and 5.4.2.5.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.1\]

The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take a 5G
NAS security context into use, and initialise and start NAS signalling
security between the UE and the AMF with the corresponding 5G NAS keys
and 5G NAS security algorithms.

Furthermore, the network may also initiate the security mode control
procedure in the following cases:

a\) in order to change the 5G NAS security algorithms for a current 5G
NAS security context already in use;

b\) in order to change the value of uplink NAS COUNT used in the latest
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\], subclause 6.9.4.4.

c\) in order to provide the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms to the
UE.

For restrictions concerning the concurrent running of a security mode
control procedure with other security related procedures in the AS or
inside the core network see 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\], subclause 6.9.5.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.3\]

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall check
whether the security mode command can be accepted or not. This is done
by performing the integrity check of the message, and by checking that
the received Replayed UE security capabilities IE has not been altered
compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the network.

When the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes an EAP-success message
the UE handles the EAP-success message and the ABBA as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.2.8 and 5.4.1.2.3.1.

If:

a\) the UE is registered for emergency services, performing initial
registration for emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU
session; or

b\) the W-AGF acts on behalf of the FN-RG;

and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received with ngKSI value
\"000\" and 5G-IA0 and 5G-EA0 as selected 5G NAS security algorithms,
the UE shall locally derive and take in use 5G NAS security context. The
UE shall delete existing current 5G NAS security context.

The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the
\"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-IA0 as the selected 5G NAS
integrity algorithm only if the message is received when the UE is
registered for emergency services, performing initial registration for
emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU session or when the
W-AGF acts on behalf of the FN-RG.

If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message is set to \"native security context\" and if the ngKSI
matches a valid non-current native 5G NAS security context held in the
UE while the UE has a mapped 5G NAS security context as the current 5G
NAS security context, the UE shall take the non-current native 5G NAS
security context into use which then becomes the current native 5G NAS
security context and delete the mapped 5G NAS security context.

The UE shall ignore the Replayed S1 UE security capabilities IE if this
IE is included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall take
the 5G NAS security context indicated in the message into use. The UE
shall in addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if:

a\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take a 5G
NAS security context into use created after a successful execution of
the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or
the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure; or

b\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of
security context flag set to \"mapped security context\" in the NAS key
set identifier IE the ngKSI does not match the current 5G NAS security
context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted and a new 5G NAS
security context is taken into use and SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
does not indicate the \"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-IA0 as
the selected NAS integrity algorithm, the UE shall:

\- if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has been successfully integrity
checked using an estimated downlink NAS COUNT equal to 0, then the UE
shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5G NAS security context to
0;

\- otherwise the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5G NAS
security context to the downlink NAS COUNT that has been used for the
successful integrity checking of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the horizontal derivation
parameter indicating \"K~AMF~ derivation is required\", the UE shall
derive a new K\'~AMF~, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\] for K~AMF~
to K\'~AMF~ derivation in mobility, and set both uplink and downlink NAS
COUNTs to zero. When the new 5G NAS security context is taken into use
for current access and the UE is registered with the same PLMN over the
3GPP access and the non-3GPP access:

a\) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over the non-current access, the AMF and
the UE shall activate the new 5G NAS security context over the
non-current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]. The AMF and
the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero for
the non-current access; or

b\) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-current access, the
AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the non-current
access to activate the new 5G NAS security context that was activated
over the current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]. The AMF
shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to
identify the new 5G NAS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the horizontal derivation
parameter indicating \"K~AMF~ derivation is not required\" or the
Additional 5G security parameters IE is not included in the message, the
UE is registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access, then after the completion of a security mode control procedure
over the current access:

a\) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over the non-current access, the AMF and
the UE shall activate the new 5G NAS security context for the
non-current access. If a primary authentication and key agreement
procedure was completed before the security mode control procedure, the
AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to
zero for the non-current access, otherwise the downlink NAS COUNT and
uplink NAS COUNT for the non-3GPP access are not changed; or

b\) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-current access, the
AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the non-current
access to activate the new 5G NAS security context that was activated
over the current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]. The AMF
shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to
identify the new 5G NAS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall send
a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected
5GS integrity algorithm and the 5G NAS integrity key based on the K~AMF~
or mapped K\'~AMF~ if the type of security context flag is set to
\"mapped security context\" indicated by the ngKSI. When the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message includes the type of security context flag set to
\"mapped security context\" in the NAS key set identifier IE, then the
UE shall check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the
ngKSI of the current 5GS security context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS
security context, in order not to re-generate the K\'~AMF~.

Furthermore, if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the
UE shall cipher the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message with the selected 5GS
ciphering algorithm and the 5GS NAS ciphering key based on the K~AMF~ or
mapped K\'~AMF~ indicated by the ngKSI. The UE shall set the security
header type of the message to \"integrity protected and ciphered with
new 5G NAS security context\".

From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS
signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering
algorithms.

If the AMF indicated in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that the
IMEISV is requested:

1\) if the UE has an IMEISV, the UE shall include its IMEISV in the
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message; or

2\) if the 5G-CRG or the W-AGF acting on behalf of the FN-CRG do not
have an IMEISV, the 5G-CRG or the W-AGF acting on behalf of the FN-CRG
shall include the 5G-CRG\'s cable modem MAC address or the FN-CRG\'s
cable modem MAC address in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

If, during an ongoing registration procedure or service request
procedure, the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the Additional 5G
security information IE with the RINMR bit set to \"Retransmission of
the initial NAS message requested\", the UE shall include the entire
uncyphered REGISTRATION REQUEST message or SERVICE REQUEST message,
which the UE had previously included in the NAS message container IE of
the initial NAS message (i.e. REGISTRATION REQUEST message or SERVICE
REQUEST message, respectively), in the NAS message container IE of the
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

If, prior to receiving the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE without
a valid 5G NAS security context had sent a REGISTRATION REQUEST message
the UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message in the NAS
message container IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described
in subclause 4.4.6.

If the UE operating in the single-registration mode receives the
Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE, the UE shall use the IE
according to 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\].

For a UE operating in single-registration mode with N26 interface
supported in the network, after an inter-system change from S1 mode to
N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall set the value of the
Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE in the 5G NAS security context
to the NAS security algorithms that were received from the source MME
when the UE was in S1 mode.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.5\]

If the security mode command cannot be accepted, the UE shall send a
SECURITY MODE REJECT message. The SECURITY MODE REJECT message contains
a 5GMM cause that typically indicates one of the following cause values:

\#23 UE security capabilities mismatch.

\#24 security mode rejected, unspecified.

If the UE detects that the received Replayed UE security capabilities IE
has been altered compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the
network, the UE shall set the cause value to \#23 \"UE security
capabilities mismatch\".

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE REJECT message, the AMF shall stop
timer T3560. The AMF shall also abort the ongoing procedure that
triggered the initiation of the NAS security mode control procedure.

Both the UE and the AMF shall apply the 5G NAS security context in use
before the initiation of the security mode control procedure, if any, to
protect the SECURITY MODE REJECT message and any other subsequent
messages according to the rules in subclause 4.4.4 and 4.4.5.

  NOTE 1: Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE REJECT message at Step 4, Both the UE and the AMF shall apply the 5G NAS security context in use before the initiation of the security mode control procedure (see TS 24.501 \[22\], clause 5.4.2.5). This means that the UE may delete the partial context (that was created during authentication) on sending SMC reject at step 4. So, network will need to perform authentication again to establish a new security context prior to initating a SMC.

}

##### 9.1.2.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-7 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.4.6 and 5.5.1. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.4.6\]

The 5GS supports protection of initial NAS messages as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]. The protection of initial NAS messages applies to
the REGISTRATION REQUEST and SERVICE REQUEST message, and is achieved as
follows:

a\) If the UE does not have a valid 5G NAS security context, the UE
sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST message including cleartext IEs only. After
activating a 5G NAS security context resulting from a security mode
control procedure:

1\) if the UE needs to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall include the
entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message (i.e. containing both cleartext IEs
and non-cleartext IEs) in the NAS message container IE and shall include
the NAS message container IE in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message;

2\) if the UE does not need to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall
include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message (i.e. containing
cleartext IEs only) in the NAS message container IE and shall include
the NAS message container IE in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

b\) If the UE has a valid 5G NAS security context and the UE needs to
send non-cleartext IEs in a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST
message, the UE includes the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE
REQUEST message (i.e. containing both cleartext IEs and non-cleartext
IEs) in the NAS message container IE and shall cipher the value part of
the NAS message container IE. The UE shall then send a REGISTRATION
REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message containing the cleartext IEs and the
NAS message container IE.

When the initial NAS message is a REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the
cleartext IEs are:

\- Extended protocol discriminator;

\- Security header type;

\- Spare half octet;

\- Registration request message identity;

\- 5GS registration type;

\- ngKSI;

\- 5GS mobile identity;

\- UE security capability;

\- Additional GUTI;

\- UE status; and

\- EPS NAS message container.

...

When the UE sends a REGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message that
includes a NAS message container IE, the UE shall set the security
header type of the initial NAS message to \"integrity protected\".

If the UE does not need to send non-cleartext IEs in the initial NAS
message, the UE shall send the initial NAS message i.e. REGISTRATION
REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message with cleartext IEs only i.e. without
including the NAS message container IE in the initial NAS message.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1\]

...

If the UE does not have a valid 5G NAS security context, the UE shall
send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without including the NAS message
container IE. The UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST
message (i.e. containing cleartext IEs and non-cleartext IEs) in the NAS
message container IE that is sent as part of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE
message as described in subclauses 4.4.6 and 5.2.4.

##### 9.1.2.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-8 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clause 4.4.4.1, 4.4.4.2, 5.4.2.1, 5.4.2.2 and
5.4.2.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.4.4.1\]

For the UE, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the 5GMM NAS
messages once a valid 5G NAS security context exists and has been taken
into use. For the network, integrity protected signalling is mandatory
for the 5GMM NAS messages once a secure exchange of 5GS NAS messages has
been established for the NAS signalling connection. Integrity protection
of all NAS signalling messages is the responsibility of the NAS. It is
the network which activates integrity protection.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.4.4.2\]

Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, the
receiving 5GMM entity in the UE shall not process any NAS signalling
messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the
NAS. If NAS signalling messages, having not successfully passed the
integrity check, are received, then the NAS in the UE shall discard that
message. The processing of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that has
not successfully passed the integrity check is specified in
subclause 5.4.2.5. If any NAS signalling message is received as not
integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has
been established by the network, then the NAS shall discard this
message.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.1\]

The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take a 5G
NAS security context into use, and initialise and start NAS signalling
security between the UE and the AMF with the corresponding 5G NAS keys
and 5G NAS security algorithms.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.2\]

The AMF initiates the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE and starting timer T3560 (see
example in figure 5.4.2.2).

The AMF shall reset the downlink NAS COUNT counter and use it to
integrity protect the initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message if the
security mode control procedure is initiated:

a\) to take into use the security context created after a successful
execution of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure or the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure; or

...

The AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message uncyphered, but
shall integrity protect the message with the 5G NAS integrity key based
on K~AMF~ or mapped K\'~AMF~ indicated by the ngKSI included in the
message. The AMF shall set the security header type of the message to
\"integrity protected with new 5G NAS security context\".

...

The AMF shall include the replayed security capabilities of the UE
(including the security capabilities with regard to NAS, RRC and UP
(user plane) ciphering as well as NAS and RRC integrity, and other
possible target network security capabilities, i.e. E-UTRAN if the UE
included them in the message to network), the selected 5GS ciphering and
integrity algorithms and the ngKSI.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.3\]

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall check
whether the security mode command can be accepted or not. This is done
by performing the integrity check of the message, and by checking that
the received Replayed UE security capabilities IE has not been altered
compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the network.

...

If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message is set to \"native security context\" and if the ngKSI
matches a valid non-current native 5G NAS security context held in the
UE while the UE has a mapped 5G NAS security context as the current 5G
NAS security context, the UE shall take the non-current native 5G NAS
security context into use which then becomes the current native 5G NAS
security context and delete the mapped 5G NAS security context.

...

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall take
the 5G NAS security context indicated in the message into use. The UE
shall in addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if:

a\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take a 5G
NAS security context into use created after a successful execution of
the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or
the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure; or

b\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of
security context flag set to \"mapped security context\" in the NAS key
set identifier IE the ngKSI does not match the current 5G NAS security
context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS security context.

...

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall send
a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected
5GS integrity algorithm and the 5G NAS integrity key based on the K~AMF~
or mapped K\'~AMF~ if the type of security context flag is set to
\"mapped security context\" indicated by the ngKSI. When the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message includes the type of security context flag set to
\"mapped security context\" in the NAS key set identifier IE, then the
UE shall check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the
ngKSI of the current 5GS security context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS
security context, in order not to re-generate the K\'~AMF~.

...

From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS
signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering
algorithms.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clause 5.4.2.1, 5.4.2.2 and 5.4.2.3. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.1\]

The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take a 5G
NAS security context into use, and initialise and start NAS signalling
security between the UE and the AMF with the corresponding 5G NAS keys
and 5G NAS security algorithms.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.2\]

The AMF initiates the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE and starting timer T3560 (see
example in figure 5.4.2.2).

The AMF shall reset the downlink NAS COUNT counter and use it to
integrity protect the initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message if the
security mode control procedure is initiated:

a\) to take into use the security context created after a successful
execution of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure or the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure; or

...

The AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message uncyphered, but
shall integrity protect the message with the 5G NAS integrity key based
on K~AMF~ or mapped K\'~AMF~ indicated by the ngKSI included in the
message. The AMF shall set the security header type of the message to
\"integrity protected with new 5G NAS security context\".

...

The AMF shall include the replayed security capabilities of the UE
(including the security capabilities with regard to NAS, RRC and UP
(user plane) ciphering as well as NAS and RRC integrity, and other
possible target network security capabilities, i.e. E-UTRAN if the UE
included them in the message to network), the selected 5GS ciphering and
integrity algorithms and the ngKSI.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.3\]

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall check
whether the security mode command can be accepted or not. This is done
by performing the integrity check of the message, and by checking that
the received Replayed UE security capabilities IE has not been altered
compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the network.

...

If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message is set to \"native security context\" and if the ngKSI
matches a valid non-current native 5G NAS security context held in the
UE while the UE has a mapped 5G NAS security context as the current 5G
NAS security context, the UE shall take the non-current native 5G NAS
security context into use which then becomes the current native 5G NAS
security context and delete the mapped 5G NAS security context.

...

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall take
the 5G NAS security context indicated in the message into use. The UE
shall in addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if:

a\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take a 5G
NAS security context into use created after a successful execution of
the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or
the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure; or

b\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of
security context flag set to \"mapped security context\" in the NAS key
set identifier IE the ngKSI does not match the current 5G NAS security
context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS security context.

...

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall send
a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected
5GS integrity algorithm and the 5G NAS integrity key based on the K~AMF~
or mapped K\'~AMF~ if the type of security context flag is set to
\"mapped security context\" indicated by the ngKSI. When the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message includes the type of security context flag set to
\"mapped security context\" in the NAS key set identifier IE, then the
UE shall check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the
ngKSI of the current 5GS security context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS
security context, in order not to re-generate the K\'~AMF~.

Furthermore, if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the
UE shall cipher the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message with the selected 5GS
ciphering algorithm and the 5GS NAS ciphering key based on the K~AMF~ or
mapped K\'~AMF~ indicated by the ngKSI. The UE shall set the security
header type of the message to \"integrity protected and ciphered with
new 5G NAS security context\".

From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS
signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering
algorithms

##### 9.1.3.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-14 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.4.3.3, 4.4.4.3 and 5.4.3.5. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.3.3\]

A UE shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any
time whilst in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message:

a\) if the Identity type IE in the IDENTITY REQUEST message is not set
to \"SUCI\", the UE shall send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message to the
network. The IDENTITY RESPONSE message shall contain the identification
parameters as requested by the network; and

b\) if the Identity type IE in the IDENTITY REQUEST message is set to
\"SUCI\", the UE shall:

1\) if timer T3519 is not running, generate a fresh SUCI as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\], send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message with the SUCI,
start timer T3519 and store the value of the SUCI sent in the IDENTITY
RESPONSE message; and

2\) if timer T3519 is running, send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message with
the stored SUCI.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.4.4.3\]

Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be
processed by the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF or forwarded to the
5GSM entity, unless the secure exchange of NAS messages has been
established for the NAS signalling connection:

a\) REGISTRATION REQUEST;

b\) IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is SUCI);

c\) AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE;

d\) AUTHENTICATION FAILURE;

e\) SECURITY MODE REJECT;

f\) DEREGISTRATION REQUEST; and

g\) DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT;

NOTE 1: The REGISTRATION REQUEST message is sent by the UE without
integrity protection, if the registration procedure is initiated due to
an inter-system change in 5GMM-IDLE mode and no current 5G NAS security
context is available in the UE. The other messages are accepted by the
AMF without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent
by the UE before security can be activated.

NOTE 2: The DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message can be sent by the UE without
integrity protection, e.g. if the UE is registered for emergency
services and there is no shared 5G NAS security context available, or if
due to user interaction a registration procedure is cancelled before the
secure exchange of NAS messages has been established. For these cases
the network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.g. whether the UE
is subsequently still performing periodic registration update or still
responding to paging) before marking the UE as 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

Integrity protection is never applied directly to 5GSM messages, but to
the 5GMM message in which the 5GSM message is included.

Once a current 5G NAS security context exists, until the secure exchange
of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection,
the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF shall process the following NAS
signalling messages, even if the MAC included in the message fails the
integrity check or cannot be verified, as the 5G NAS security context is
not available in the network:

a\) REGISTRATION REQUEST;

b\) IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is SUCI);

c\) AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE;

d\) AUTHENTICATION FAILURE;

e\) SECURITY MODE REJECT;

f\) DEREGISTRATION REQUEST;

g\) DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT; and

h\) SERVICE REQUEST;

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.3.5\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) Transmission failure of the IDENTITY RESPONSE message (if the
identification procedure is triggered by a registration procedure).

The UE shall re-initiate the registration procedure.

b\) Requested identity is not available

If the UE cannot encode the requested identity in the IDENTITY RESPONSE
message, e.g. because no valid USIM is available, then it shall encode
the identity type as \"No identity\".

##### 9.1.4.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-15 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 4.6.2.2, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.4.2, 5.4.4.3,
5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.3.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 4.6.2.2\]

If available, the configured NSSAI(s) shall be stored in a non-volatile
memory in the ME as specified in annex C.

...

If the UE receives the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message indicating
\"registration requested\" and contains no other parameters (see
subclauses 5.4.4.2 and 5.4.4.3), the UE shall delete any stored allowed
NSSAI for this PLMN, and delete any stored mapping of each S-NSSAI of
the allowed NSSAI to the S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN, if available;

...

d\) When the UE receives the Network slicing indication IE with the
Network slicing subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing
subscription changed\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall delete the network
slicing information for each of the PLMNs that the UE has slicing
information stored for (excluding the current PLMN). The UE shall not
delete the default configured NSSAI. Additionally, the UE shall update
the network slicing information for the current PLMN (if received) as
specified above in bullets a), b) and c):

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to:

a\) allow the AMF to update the UE configuration for access and mobility
management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF by
providing new parameter information within the command; or

b\) request the UE to perform a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update towards the network to update access and
mobility management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF
(see subclause 5.5.1.3).

This procedure is initiated by the network and can only be used when the
UE has an established 5GMM context, and the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode. When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the AMF may use the paging or
notification procedure to initiate the generic UE configuration update
procedure. The AMF can request a confirmation response in order to
ensure that the parameter has been updated by the UE.

This procedure shall be initiated by the network to assign a new 5G-GUTI
to the UE after a successful service request procedure invoked as a
response to a paging request from the network and before the release of
the N1 NAS signalling connection. If the service request procedure was
triggered due to 5GSM downlink signalling pending, the procedure for
assigning a new 5G-GUTI can be initiated by the network after the
transport of the 5GSM downlink signalling.

The following parameters are supported by the generic UE configuration
update procedure without the need to request the UE to perform the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update:

a\) 5G-GUTI;

b\) TAI list;

c\) Service area list;

d\) Network identity and time zone information (Full name for network,
short name for network, local time zone, universal time and local time
zone, network daylight saving time);

e\) LADN information;

f\) Rejected NSSAI;

g\) Network slicing indication;

h\) Operator-defined access category definitions; and

i\) SMS indication.

The following parameters can be sent to the UE with or without a request
to perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update:

a\) Allowed NSSAI; or

b\) Configured NSSAI.

The following parameter is sent to the UE with a request to perform the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update:

a\) MICO indication.

The following parameters are sent over 3GPP access only:

a\) LADN information;

b\) MICO indication;

c\) TAI list; and

d\) Service area list.

The following parameters are managed and sent per access type i.e.,
independently over 3GPP access or non 3GPP access:

a\) Allowed NSSAI; and

b\) Rejected NSSAI (when the NSSAI is rejected for the current
registration area).

The following parameters are managed commonly and sent over 3GPP access
or non 3GPP access:

a\) 5G-GUTI;

b\) Network identity and time zone information;

c\) Rejected NSSAI (when the NSSAI is rejected for the current PLMN);

d\) Configured NSSAI; and

e\) SMS indication.

Figure 5.4.4.1.1: Generic UE configuration update procedure

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.2\]

The AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure by
sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.

The AMF shall in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message either:

a\) include one or more of the following parameters: 5G-GUTI, TAI list,
allowed NSSAI that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), LADN information,
service area list, MICO indication NITZ information, configured NSSAI
that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), rejected NSSAI, network slicing
indication, operator-defined access category definitions or SMS
indication;

b\) include the Configuration update indication IE with the Registration
requested bit set to \"registration requested\"; or

c\) include a combination of both a) and b).

If an acknowledgement from the UE is requested, the AMF shall indicate
\"acknowledgement requested\" in the Acknowledgement bit of the
Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message and shall start timer T3555. Acknowledgement shall be requested
for all parameters except when only NITZ is included.

To initiate parameter re-negotiation between the UE and network, the AMF
shall indicate \"registration requested\" in the Registration requested
bit of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message.

If a new allowed NSSAI information or AMF re-configuration of supported
S-NSSAIs requires an AMF relocation, the AMF shall indicate
\"registration requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the
Configuration update indication IE and include the Allowed NSSAI IE in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.

If the AMF includes a new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message and the new configured NSSAI requires an AMF relocation
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the AMF shall indicate
\"registration requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the
Configuration update indication IE in the message.

If the AMF indicates \"registration requested\" in the Registration
requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE, acknowledgement
shall be requested.

If changes to the allowed NSSAI require the UE to initiate a
registration procedure, but the AMF is unable to determine an allowed
NSSAI for the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message shall indicate \"registration requested\" in the
Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE,
and shall not contain any other parameters.

If the AMF needs to update the LADN information, the AMF shall include
the LADN information in the LADN information IE of the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message.

During an established 5GMM context, the network may send none, one, or
more CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND messages to the UE. If more than one
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is sent, the messages need not have
the same content.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.3\]

Upon receiving the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall
stop timer T3346 if running and use the contents to update appropriate
information stored within the UE.

If \"acknowledgement requested\" is indicated in the Acknowledgement bit
of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE
message.

If the UE receives a new 5G-GUTI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall consider the new 5G-GUTI as valid, the old 5G-GUTI
as invalid, stop timer T3519 if running, and delete any stored SUCI;
otherwise, the UE shall consider the old 5G-GUTI as valid. The UE shall
provide the 5G-GUTI to the lower layer of 3GPP access if the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is sent over the non-3GPP access,
and the UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED in both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
in the same PLMN.

If the UE receives a new TAI list in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI
list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as
valid.

If the UE receives a new service area list in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new service area list as
valid and the old service area list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall
consider the old service area list, if any, as valid.

If the UE receives new NITZ information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE considers the new NITZ information as valid and
the old NITZ information as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider
the old NITZ information as valid.

If the UE receives a LADN information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the old LADN information as
invalid and the new LADN information as valid, if any; otherwise, the UE
shall consider the old LADN information as valid.

If the UE receives a new allowed NSSAI for the associated access type in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new
allowed NSSAI as valid for the associated access type, store the allowed
NSSAI for the associated access type as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2
and consider the old allowed NSSAI for the associated access type as
invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old Allowed NSSAI as valid
for the associated access type.

If the UE receives a new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new configured NSSAI for the
registered PLMN as valid and the old configured NSSAI for the registered
PLMN as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old configured
NSSAI for the registered PLMN as valid The UE shall store the new
configured NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the UE receives the Network slicing indication IE in the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the Network slicing
subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing subscription
changed\", the UE shall delete the network slicing information for each
and every PLMN except for the current PLMN as specified in
subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the UE receives Operator-defined access category definitions IE in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and the Operator-defined access
category definitions IE contains one or more operator-defined access
category definitions, the UE shall delete any operator-defined access
category definitions stored for the RPLMN and shall store the received
operator-defined access category definitions for the RPLMN. If the UE
receives the Operator-defined access category definitions IE in the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and the Operator-defined access
category definitions IE contains no operator-defined access category
definitions, the UE shall delete any operator-defined access category
definitions stored for the RPLMN. If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message does not contain the Operator-defined access category
definitions IE, the UE shall not delete the operator-defined access
category definitions stored for the RPLMN.

If the UE receives the SMS indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message with the SMS availability indication set to:

a\) \"SMS over NAS not available\", the UE shall consider that SMS over
NAS transport is not allowed by the network; and

b\) \"SMS over NAS available\", the UE may request the use of SMS over
NAS transport by performing a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3, after
the completion of the generic UE configuration update procedure.

If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message indicates \"registration
requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration
update indication IE and:

a\) contains no other parameters or contains at least one of the
following parameters: a new allowed NSSAI, a new configured NSSAI or the
Network slicing subscription change indication, and:

1\) an emergency PDU session exists, the UE shall, after the completion
of the generic UE configuration update procedure and the release of the
emergency PDU session, release the existing N1 NAS signalling
connection, and start a registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3; or

2\) no emergency PDU Session exists, the UE shall, after the completion
of the generic UE configuration update procedure and the release of the
existing N1 NAS signalling connection, start a registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update as specified in
subclause 5.5.1.3; or

b\) an MICO indication is included without a new allowed NSSAI or a new
configured NSSAI, the UE shall, after the completion of the generic UE
configuration update procedure, start a registration procedure for
mobility and registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3 to
re-negotiate MICO mode with the network.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the
rejected NSSAI:

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not attempt to use
this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current registration area until
switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current registration area
or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of
one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN.

NOTE 3: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed
NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation specific.
The UE can take preferences indicated by the upper layers (e.g.
policies, applications) into account.

NOTE 4: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot
exceed eight.

If the UE initiates an initial registration for emergency services or
needs to prolong the established NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the initial registration procedure (e.g. due to uplink
signalling pending), the UE shall set the Follow-on request indicator to
1.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

For a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with a 5GS registration type IE
indicating \"mobility registration updating\", UE shall include the
requested NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to the slices to
which the UE intends to register with and shall include the mapped
S-NSSAI(s) for the requested NSSAI, if available, in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message. If the UE has allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI for the
current PLMN, the requested NSSAI shall be either:

a\) the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN;

b\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or

c\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for
which no corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and those
are neither in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN nor in the
rejected NSSAI for the current registration area.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN nor configured
NSSAI for the current PLMN and has a default configured NSSAI, the UE
shall:

a\) include the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message using the default configured NSSAI; and

b\) include the Network slicing indication IE with the Default
configured NSSAI indication bit set to \"Requested NSSAI created from
default configured NSSAI\" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, no configured NSSAI
for the current PLMN, and no default configured NSSAI, the UE shall not
include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to this PLMN,
if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAIs for the current PLMN
nor in the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area.

The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of
one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for this PLMN.

NOTE 3: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed
NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation specific.
The UE can take preferences indicated by the upper layers (e.g.
policies, applications) into account.

NOTE 4: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot
exceed eight.

##### 9.1.4.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-16 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.22.2, 5.4.4.2, 5.4.4.3, 5.5.2.1 and
5.5.2.3.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.22.2\]

The 5GS supports the USS UAV Authorization and Authentication (UUAA)
procedure for a UE supporting UAS services. Depending on operator policy
or regulatory requirements, the UUAA-MM procedure can be performed by
the UE and the AMF at a registration procedure as specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2 or the UUAA-SM procedure can be performed by the UE
and the SMF at a PDU session establishment procedure as specified in
subclause 6.4.1.2. The UE shall support UUAA-MM and UUAA-SM, and the
network shall support UUAA-SM and may optionally support UUAA-MM. The
UUAA procedure needs to be performed by 5GS with USS successfully before
the connectivity for UAS services is established.

During the registration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1.2, the
UE supporting UAS services provides CAA-level UAV ID to the AMF, and the
AMF may trigger the UUAA-MM procedure. If the UE supporting UAS services
does not provide CAA-level UAV ID to the AMF and the network is
configured to perform UUAA-MM at registration procedure, the AMF may
accept the registration request and shall mark in the UE\'s 5GMM context
that the UE is not allowed to request UAS services. If the UE wants to
use the UAS services by providing the CAA-Level UAV ID later on, the UE
shall perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update.

When a UE supporting UAS services requests to establish a PDU session as
described in subclause 6.4.1.2 for USS communication, the UE provides
CAA-level UAV ID to the network, and the SMF may trigger the UUAA-SM
procedure based on the DNN and S-NSSAI combination for aerial services
according to the user\'s subscription data and the CAA-level UAV ID
provided by the UE.

...

If the UUAA is revoked, the PDU session related to the UAS services
shall be released by the SMF. Based on operator policy, the AMF may
decide to keep the UE registered or trigger a de-registration procedure.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.2\]

...

During an established 5GMM context, the network may send none, one, or
more CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND messages to the UE. If more than one
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is sent, the messages need not have
the same content.

...If the AMF needs to deliver to the UE the UUAA revocation
notification received from the UAS-NF, the AMF shall include the
service-level-AA response with SLAR set to \"Service level
authentication and authorization was not successful or service level
authorization is revoked\" in the Service-level-AA container IE of the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.3\]

Upon receiving the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall
stop timer T3346 if running and use the contents to update appropriate
information stored within the UE.

If \"acknowledgement requested\" is indicated in the Acknowledgement bit
of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE
message.

...

If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message includes the
service-level-AA response in the Service-level-AA container IE with the
SLAR field set to \"Service level authentication and authorization was
not successful or service level authorization is revoked\", the UE shall
forward the service-level-AA response to the upper layers, so the UUAA
authorization data is deleted as specified in 3GPP TS 33.256 \[24B\].

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.1\]

The de-registration procedure is used:

...

h\) by the network to inform the UE supporting UAS service that it is
deregistered for UAS services in 5GS.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.3.1\]

The network initiates the de-registration procedure by sending a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE (see example in
figure 5.5.2.3.1.1).

NOTE 1: If the AMF performs a local de-registration, it will inform the
UE with a 5GMM messages (e.g. SERVICE REJECT message or REGISTRATION
REJECT message) with 5GMM cause \#10 \"implicitly de-registered\" only
when the UE initiates a 5GMM procedure.

The network may include a 5GMM cause IE to specify the reason for the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. The network shall start timer T3522. The
network shall indicate whether re-registration is needed or not in the
De-registration type IE. The network shall also indicate via the access
type whether the de-registration procedure is:

a\) for 3GPP access only;

b\) for non-3GPP access only; or

c\) for 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both when the UE is registered
in the same PLMN for both accesses.

...

If the network de-registration is triggered due to:

...

b\) an UUAA revocation notification received from the UAS-NF for a UE
supporting UAS service requesting UAS services; or

...

then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message to \#79 \"UAS services not allowed\".

NOTE 3: If the UE supporting UAS service has requested other services
than UAS services, or if there are other ongoing network slice-specific
authentication and authorization on pending NSSAIs, it is then an
operator policy or configuration decision whether to keep the UE
supporting UAS service registered to the network, but that UE supporting
UAS services is not allowed to access UAS services via 5GS as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.256 \[6AB\].

...

The AMF shall trigger the SMF to release locally the PDU session(s) over
the indicated access(es), if any, for the UE and enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED. If a PDU session is associated with one or
more multicast MBS sessions, the SMF shall consider the UE as removed
from the associated multicast MBS sessions.

##### 9.1.5.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-17 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.2.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by
sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, starting timer T3510.
If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3502. If
timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.

During initial registration the UE handles the 5GS mobile identity IE in
the following order:

b\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, by the same PLMN with which the UE is
performing the registration, the UE shall indicate the 5G-GUTI in the
5GS mobile identity IE;

c\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, by an equivalent PLMN, the UE shall
indicate the 5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE;

d\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP, by any other PLMN, the UE shall indicate the
5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE;

e\) if a SUCI is available the UE shall include the SUCI in the 5GS
mobile identity IE; and

...

If the SUCI is included in the 5GS mobile identity IE and the timer
T3519 is not running, the UE shall start timer T3519 and store the value
of the SUCI sent in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. The UE shall
include the stored SUCI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message while timer
T3519 is running.

...

If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include
the last visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.1.3.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

...

The AMF may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC).
The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if the
initial registration procedure is not for emergency services, the UE
shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs\". In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list
the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall
replace the stored list on each receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain a list,
then the UE shall delete the stored list.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.4\]

...

The AMF may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC).
The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if there is
no emergency PDU session established, the UE shall remove from the list
any PLMN code that is already in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\". If the
UE is not registered for emergency services and there is an emergency
PDU session established, the UE shall remove from the list of equivalent
PLMNs any PLMN code present in the \"forbidden PLMNs list\" when the
emergency PDU session is released. In addition, the UE shall add to the
stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The
UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain a
list, then the UE shall delete the stored list.

##### 9.1.5.1.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-19 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], clause 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.2.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE shall include the requested NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s)
corresponding to the slice(s) to which the UE intendsto register and
shall include themapped S-NSSAI(s) for the requested NSSAI, if
available, in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE has allowed
NSSAI or configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, the requested NSSAI
shall be either:

a\) the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN;

b\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or

c\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for
which no corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and those
are neither in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN nor in the
rejected NSSAI for the current area.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN nor configured
NSSAI for the current PLMN and has a default configured NSSAI, the UE
shall:

a\) include the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message using the default configured NSSAI; and

b\) include the Network slicing indication IE with the Default
configured NSSAI indication bit set to \"Requested NSSAI created from
default configured NSSAI\" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, no configured NSSAI
for the current PLMN, and no default configured NSSAI, the UE shall not
include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION message.

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the
current PLMN, if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN nor in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and
registration area combination.

The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of
one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN.

NOTE 3: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed
NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation specific.
The UE can take preferences indicated by the upper layers(e.g.
policies,application) into account.

NOTE 4: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot
exceed eight.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

The AMF shall include the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN and shall
include the mapped S-NSSAI for the allowed NSSAI containedfrom the UE if
available, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UE included the
requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF allows
one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI. The AMF may also include
rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Rejected NSSAI
contains S-NSSAI(s) which was included in the requested NSSAI but
rejected by the network associated with rejection cause(s).

The AMF may include a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if:

a\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message did not include the requested
NSSAI;

b\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the requested NSSAI
containing an S-NSSAI that is not valid in the serving PLMN; or

c\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the Network slicing
indication IE with the Default configured NSSAI indication bit set to
\"Requested NSSAI created from default configured NSSAI\".

If a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN is included in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the AMF shall also include the mapped
NSSAI(s) for the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN if available in
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. In this case the AMF shall start timer
T3550 and enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in
subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The AMF shall include the Network slicing indication IE with the Network
slicing subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing
subscription changed\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UDM has
indicated that the subscription data for network slicing has changed. In
this case the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state
5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
NSSAI:

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not attempt to use
this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current registration area until
switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current registration area
or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or none of the requested NSSAI are present in the
subscribed S-NSSAIs, and one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs (containing one
or more S-NSSAIs each of which may be associated with a new S-NSSAI)
marked as default are available, the AMF shall put the subscribed
S-NSSAIs marked as default in the allowed NSSAI of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. The AMF shall determine a registration area such that
all S-NSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI are available in the registration
area.

specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.2.4.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

5.5.1.2.1 General

This procedure can be used by a UE for initial registration for 5GS
services.

...

The UE shall include the requested NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s)
corresponding to the slice(s) to which the UE wants to register and
shall include the mapping of the requested NSSAI which is the mapping of
each S-NSSAI of the requested NSSAI to the S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN, if
available, in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE has allowed
NSSAI or configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, the requested NSSAI
shall be either:

a\) the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN;

b\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or

c\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for
which no corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and those
are neither in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN nor in the
rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and registration area combination.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN nor configured
NSSAI for the current PLMN and has a default configured NSSAI, the UE
shall:

a\) include the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message using the default configured NSSAI; and

b\) include the Network slicing indication IE with the Default
configured NSSAI indication bit set to \"Requested NSSAI created from
default configured NSSAI\" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, no configured NSSAI
for the current PLMN, and no default configured NSSAI, the UE shall not
include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION message.

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the
current PLMN, if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN nor in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and
registration area combination.

The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of
one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN.

NOTE 3: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed
NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation.

NOTE 4: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot
exceed eight.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

The AMF shall include the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN and shall
include the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the allowed NSSAI to the
S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN contained in the requested NSSAI from the UE if
available, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UE included the
requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF allows
one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI. The AMF may also include
rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Rejected NSSAI
contains S-NSSAI(s) which was included in the requested NSSAI but
rejected by the network associated with rejection cause(s).

The AMF may include a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if:

a\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message did not include the requested
NSSAI;

b\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the requested NSSAI
containing an S-NSSAI that is not valid in the serving PLMN; or

c\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the Network slicing
indication IE with the Default configured NSSAI indication bit set to
\"Requested NSSAI created from default configured NSSAI\".

If a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN is included in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the AMF shall also include the mapping of
the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN the S-NSSAI(s) of the to HPLMN
if available in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. In this case the AMF
shall start timer T3550 and enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED
as described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The AMF shall include the Network slicing indication IE with the Network
slicing subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing
subscription changed\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UDM has
indicated that the subscription data for network slicing has changed. In
this case the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state
5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
NSSAI:

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not attempt to use
this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN and registration area combination as specified in
subclause 4.6.2.2 and not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current
registration area until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the
current registration area or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or none of the requested NSSAI are present in the
subscribed S-NSSAIs, and one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs (containing one
or more S-NSSAIs each of which may be associated with a new S-NSSAI)
marked as default are available, the AMF shall put the subscribed
S-NSSAIs marked as default in the allowed NSSAI of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. The AMF shall determine a registration area such that
all S-NSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI are available in the registration
area.

##### 9.1.5.1.4 Initial registration / 5GS services / MICO mode / TAI list handling

##### 9.1.5.1.4.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-20 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-63 .H6}

**with** { The UE is in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state and is switched off }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the UE supports MICO mode and requests the use of MICO mode }

**then** { the UE includes the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message }

}

##### (2) {#section-64 .H6}

**with** { The UE has received REGISTRATION ACCEPT message }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message included MICO indication IE
indicating "all PLMN registration area allocated" }

**then** { the UE treats all TAIs in the current PLMN as a registration
area and deletes its old TAI list }

}

##### (3) {#section-65 .H6}

**with** { The UE detecting a better NG cell in same PLMN }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the UE treats all TAIs in the current PLMN as a registration
area and has deleted its old TAI list as a result of REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message included MICO indication IE indicating "all PLMN registration
area allocated" }

**then** { the UE does not perform the REGISTRATION procedure for
mobility }

}

##### (4) {#section-66 .H6}

**with** { MICO mode activated in the UE }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the UE needs to transfer mobile originated signalling }

**then** { the UE deactivates MICO mode and transmits a SERVICE REQUEST
message with IE Service type set to "signalling" }

}

##### 9.1.5.1.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-20 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.304, clause 4.1 and TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2,
clause 5.5.1.2.4 and clause 5.3.6. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

...

If the UE supports MICO mode and requests the use of MICO mode, then the
UE shall include the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

...

The AMF shall include the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message only if the MICO indication IE was included in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message, the AMF supports and accepts the use of MICO mode. If
the AMF supports and accepts the use of MICO mode, the AMF may indicate
\"all PLMN registration area allocated\" in the MICO indication IE in
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If \"all PLMN registration area
allocated\" is indicated in the MICO indication IE, the AMF shall not
assign and include the TAI list in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message included an MICO indication IE
indicating \"all PLMN registration area allocated\", the UE shall treat
all TAIs in the current PLMN as a registration area and delete its old
TAI list.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.3.6\]

...

The UE may deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at any time.
Upon deactivating MICO mode, the UE may initiate 5GMM procedures (e.g.
for the transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data).

...

\[TS 38.304, clause 4.1\]

...

When the UE is in RRC\_IDLE state, upper layers may deactivate AS layer
when MICO mode is activated as specified in TS 24.501 \[14\]. When MICO
mode is activated, the AS configuration (e.g. priorities provided by
dedicated signalling) is kept and all running timers continue to run but
the UE need not perform any idle mode tasks. If a timer expires while
MICO mode is activated it is up to the UE implementation whether it
performs the corresponding action immediately or the latest when MICO
mode is deactivated. When MICO mode is deactivated, the UE shall perform
all idle mode tasks.

...

##### 9.1.5.1.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-21 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.1 5.5.1.2.7, and 10.2. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.1\]

Additionally, the registration attempt counter shall be reset when the
UE is in sub state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION or
5GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION-UPDATE, and:

\- a new tracking area is entered;

\- timer T3502 expires; or

\- timer T3346 is started.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.7\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

...

c\) T3510 timeout.

The UE shall abort the registration procedure for initial registration
and the NAS signalling connection, if any, shall be released locally if
the initial registration request is not for emergency services. The UE
shall proceed as described below.

d\) REGISTRATION REJECT message, other 5GMM cause values than those
treated in subclause 5.5.1.2.5, and cases of 5GMM cause value \#22, if
considered as abnormal cases according to subclause 5.5.1.2.5.

If the registration request is not an initial registration request for
emergency services, upon reception of the 5GMM causes \#95, \#96, \#97,
\#99 and \#111 the UE should set the registration attempt counter to 5.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

e\) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection
received from lower layers before the REGISTRATION ACCEPT or
REGISTRATION REJECT message is received.

The UE shall abort the registration procedure for initial registration
and proceed as described below.

...

For the cases c, d and e, the UE shall proceed as follows:

Timer T3510 shall be stopped if still running.

If the registration procedure is neither an initial registration for
emergency services nor for establishing an emergency PDU session with
registration type not set to \"emergency registration\", the
registration attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already
set to 5.

If the registration attempt counter is less than 5:

\- if the initial registration request is not for emergency services,
timer T3511 is started and the state is changed to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION. When timer T3511 expires the
registration procedure for initial registration shall be restarted, if
still required.

If the registration attempt counter is equal to 5

\- the UE shall delete 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited TAI, list of
equivalent PLMNs and ngKSI, start timer T3502 and shall set the 5GS
update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED. The state is changed to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION or optionally to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

##### 9.1.5.1.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-22 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.5.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\#3 (Illegal UE); or

\#6 (Illegal ME).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. The UE shall
consider the USIM as invalid for 5GS services until switching off or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed. The UE shall delete the list of
equivalent PLMNs and enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, TAI list and
eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the case when the EPS
attach request procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same
value. The USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-EPS services
until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE also supports the registration procedure over the other
access, the UE shall in addition handle 5GMM parameters and 5GMM state
for this access, as described for this 5GMM cause value.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.2.5.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

\[Rel-15\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\#3 (Illegal UE); or

\#6 (Illegal ME).

....

\#73 (Serving network not authorized).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED, reset the
registration attempt counter, store the PLMN identity in the \"forbidden
PLMN list\" and enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to
perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

\[Rel-16\]

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\#3 (Illegal UE); or

\#6 (Illegal ME).

...

\#73 (Serving network not authorized).

This cause value received from a cell belonging to an SNPN is considered
as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. The UE shall
delete the list of equivalent PLMNs, reset the registration attempt
counter, store the PLMN identity in the forbidden PLMN list as specified
in subclause 5.3.13A, and enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in
order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]. If
the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS, the UE
shall set the PLMN-specific attempt counter and the PLMN-specific
attempt counter for non-3GPP access for that PLMN to the UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in

##### (1) {#section-74 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED state }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the SS sends a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE
including an appropriate 5GMM cause value \#12 (Tracking area not
allowed)}

**then** { the UE deletes any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI and
ngKSI, stores the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\". }

}

##### (2) {#section-75 .H6}

**with** { the UE is in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state and the
TAI of the current cell belongs to the list of \"forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\"}

**ensure that** {

**when** { the UE enters a cell belonging to a tracking area not in the
list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\"}

**then** { the UE attempts to registration }

}

##### (3) {#section-76 .H6}

**with** { the UE is in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state and the
list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\"
contains more than one TAI}

**ensure that** {

**when** { the UE selects a cell belonging to one of the TAIs in the
list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" }

**then** { the UE does not attempt to registration }

}

##### (4) {#section-77 .H6}

**with** { the UE is switched off or the UICC containing the USIM is
removed }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE is powered on in the cell belonging to the TAI which was
in the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service\" before the UE was switched off or the USIM is inserted again
on that cell }

**then** { UE performs registration on that cell }

}

##### 9.1.5.1.11.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-26 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.2.5, 5.1.3.2.2.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

...

\#12 (Tracking area not allowed).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally,
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter.

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\" and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.2\]

In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour, the 5GS update (5U)
status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.

If the UE is not SNPN enabled or the UE is not operating in SNPN access
mode (see 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), the 5GS update status is stored in a
non-volatile memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in
the USIM, else in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in
annex C.

If the UE is operating in SNPN access mode, the 5GS update status for
each SNPN whose SNPN identity is included in the \"list of subscriber
data\" configured in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) is stored in the
non-volatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.

The 5GS update status value is changed only after the execution of a
registration, network-initiated de-registration, 5GS based primary
authentication and key agreement, service request or paging procedure.

5U1: UPDATED

The last registration attempt was successful.

5U2: NOT UPDATED

The last registration attempt failed procedurally, e.g. no response or
reject message was received from the AMF.

5U3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

The last registration, service request, or registration for mobility or
periodic registration update attempt was correctly performed, but the
answer from the AMF was negative (because of roaming or subscription
restrictions).

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.3.13\]

The UE shall store a list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\", as well as a list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\". Within the 5GS, these lists are managed
independently per access type, i.e., 3GPP access or non-3GPP access.
These lists shall be erased when

a\) the UE is switched off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or
an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of
the current SNPN is updated; and

b\) periodically (with a period in the range 12 to 24 hours).

Over 3GPP access, when the lists are erased, the UE performs cell
selection according to 3GPP TS 38.304 \[28\]. A tracking area shall be
removed from the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\",
as well as the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", if the UE receives the tracking area in the TAI
list or the Service area list of \"allowed tracking areas\" in
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
The UE shall not remove the tracking area from \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for roaming\" or \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\" if the UE is registered for emergency services.

In N1 mode, the UE shall update the suitable list whenever a
REGISTRATION REJECT, SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is
received with the 5GMM cause \#12 \"tracking area not allowed\", \#13
\"roaming not allowed in this tracking area\", or \#15 \"no suitable
cells in tracking area\".

Each list shall accommodate 40 or more TAIs. When the list is full and a
new entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted.

##### 9.1.5.1.12.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-27 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.5, 5.1.3.2.1, 5.1.3.2.2, TS
23.122 clauses 3.1.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

...

\#13 (Roaming not allowed in this tracking area).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally,
the UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and reset the
registration attempt counter.

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\" and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE or optionally
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH. The UE shall perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.1.3.3\]

The sub state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE is chosen in the UE,
when it is known that a selected cell for 3GPP access or TA for non-3GPP
access is unable to provide normal service (e.g. the selected cell over
3GPP access is in a forbidden PLMN or is in a forbidden tracking area or
TA for non-3GPP access is forbidden).

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.1.3.5\]

The sub state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH is chosen in the UE, if the
UE is searching for PLMNs. This sub state is left either when a cell has
been selected (the new sub state is NORMAL-SERVICE or LIMITED-SERVICE)
or when it has been concluded that no cell is available at the moment
(the new sub state is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE).

This sub state is not applicable to non-3GPP access.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.2\]

In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour, the 5GS update (5U)
status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.

If the UE is not SNPN enabled or the UE is not operating in SNPN access
mode (see 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), the 5GS update status is stored in a
non-volatile memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in
the USIM, else in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in
annex C.

If the UE is operating in SNPN access mode, the 5GS update status for
each SNPN whose SNPN identity is included in the \"list of subscriber
data\" configured in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) is stored in the
non-volatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.

The 5GS update status value is changed only after the execution of a
registration, network-initiated de-registration, 5GS based primary
authentication and key agreement, service request or paging procedure.

5U1: UPDATED

The last registration attempt was successful.

5U2: NOT UPDATED

The last registration attempt failed procedurally, e.g. no response or
reject message was received from the AMF.

5U3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

The last registration, service request, or registration for mobility or
periodic registration update attempt was correctly performed, but the
answer from the AMF was negative (because of roaming or subscription
restrictions).

\[TS 23.122, clause 3.1\]

The tracking area is added to the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas
for roaming\" which is stored in the MS. The MS shall then search for a
suitable cell in the same PLMN but belonging to a tracking area which is
not in the \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" list.

cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\#3 (Illegal UE); or

\#6 (Illegal ME).

....

\#15 (No suitable cells in tracking area);

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally, the UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter.

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\" and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. The UE shall search for a suitable
cell in another tracking area according to 3GPP TS 38.304 \[15\].

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.2.2.3.3, 5.5.1.2.5 and 5.5.1.2.7.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\#3 (Illegal UE);

\#6 (Illegal ME); or

....

\#22 (Congestion).

If the T3346 value IE is present in the REGISTRATION REJECT message and
the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the
UE shall proceed as described below; otherwise it shall be considered as
an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified
in subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

The UE shall abort the initial registration procedure, set the 5GS
update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION.

The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall
start timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.

If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE
shall start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[12\].

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The initial registration procedure is started if
still needed when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

\#27 (N1 mode not allowed).

The UE capable of S1 mode shall disable the N1 mode capability for both
3GPP access and non-3GPP access (see subclause 4.9).

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.7\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) Timer T3346 is running.

The UE shall not start the registration procedure for initial
registration unless:

1\) the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN;
or

2\) the UE needs to perform the registration procedure for initial
registration for emergency services.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.

NOTE 1: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a
registration procedure for initial registration while timer T3346 is
running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an
abnormal case or a non-successful case.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.2.2.3.3\]

The UE in 3GPP access:

a\) ...

b\) ...

c\) shall initiate an initial registration procedure when entering a new
PLMN, if timer T3346 is running and the new PLMN is not equivalent to
the PLMN where the UE started timer T3346, the PLMN identity of the new
cell is not in the forbidden PLMN lists and the tracking area is not in
one of the lists of 5GS forbidden tracking areas;

According to this description method, the IE is presented in its maximum
format, i.e., T, TV, TLV or TLV-E, in a picture representing the bits in
a table, each line representing an octet. Bits appear in the occidental
order, i.e., from left of the page to right of the page, and from top of
the page to bottom of the page.

Boxes so delimited contains typically the field name, possibly an
indication of which bits in the field are in the box, and possibly a
value (e.g., for spare bits).

A specific method can be used in the IE description to describe a
branching structure, i.e., a structure variable according to the value
of particular fields in the IE. This design is unusual outside type 4
and type 6 IEs, and as, a design rule, should be used only in type 4 and
type 6 IEs.

a\) The octet number of an octet within the IE is defined typically in
the table. It consists of a positive integer, possibly of an additional
letter, and possibly of an additional asterisk, see clause f). The
positive integer identifies one octet or a group of octets.

b\) Each octet group is a self-contained entity. The internal structure
of an octet group may be defined in alternative ways.

...

f\) Optional octets are marked with asterisks (\*). As a design rule,
the presence or absence of an optional octet should be determinable from
information in the IE and preceding the optional octet. Care should be
taken not to introduce ambiguities with optional octets.

g\) At the end of the IE, additional octets may be added in later
versions of the protocols also without using the mechanisms defined in
c) and d). Equipment shall be prepared to receive such additional
octets; the contents of these octets shall be ignored. However the
length indicated in the formal description of the messages and of the
individual information elements only takes into account this version of
the protocols.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE performs initial registration for 5GS services;

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

c\) when the UE performs initial registration for SMS over NAS; and

d\) when the UE moves from GERAN to NG-RAN coverage or the UE moves from
a UTRAN to NG-RAN coverage.

with the following clarifications to initial registration for emergency
services:

a\) the UE shall not initiate an initial registration for emergency
services over the current access, if the UE is already registered for
emergency services over the non-current access, unless the initial
registration has to be initiated to perform handover of an existing
emergency PDU session from the non-current access to the current access;
and

NOTE 1: Transfer of an existing emergency PDU session between 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access is needed e.g. if the UE determines that the
current access is no longer available.

b\) the UE can only initiate an initial registration for emergency
services over non-3GPP access if it cannot register for emergency
services over 3GPP access.

The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by
sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, starting timer T3510.
If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3502. If
timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.

During initial registration the UE handles the 5GS mobile identity IE in
the following order:

a\) Void

b\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, by the same PLMN with which the UE is
performing the registration, the UE shall indicate the 5G-GUTI in the
5GS mobile identity IE;

c\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, by an equivalent PLMN, the UE shall
indicate the 5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE;

d\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP, by any other PLMN, the UE shall indicate the
5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE;

e\) if a SUCI is available the UE shall include the SUCI in the 5GS
mobile identity IE; and

f\) if the UE does not hold a valid 5G-GUTI or SUCI, and is initiating
the registration procedure for emergency services, the PEI shall be
included in the 5GS mobile identity IE.

If the SUCI is included in the 5GS mobile identity IE and the timer
T3519 is not running, the UE shall start timer T3519 and store the value
of the SUCI sent in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. The UE shall
include the stored SUCI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message while timer
T3519 is running.

If the UE is operating in the dual-registration mode and it is in EMM
state EMM-REGISTERED, the UE shall include the UE status IE with the EMM
registration status set to \"UE is in EMM-REGISTERED state\".

NOTE 2: Inclusion of the UE status IE with this setting corresponds to
the indication that the UE is \"moving from EPC\" as specified in
3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\].

If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include
the last visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE requests the use of SMS over NAS, the UE shall include the 5GS
update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the SMS
requested bit set to \"SMS over NAS supported\". When the 5GS update
type IE is included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST for reasons other than
requesting the use of SMS over NAS, and the UE does not need to register
for SMS over NAS, the UE shall set the SMS requested bit of the 5GS
update type IE to \"SMS over NAS not supported\" in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

If the UE supports MICO mode and requests the use of MICO mode, then the
UE shall include the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

If the UE needs to use the UE specific DRX parameters, the UE shall
include the Requested DRX parameters IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

If the UE needs to request LADN information for specific LADN DNN(s) or
indicates a request for LADN information as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the UE shall include the LADN indication IE in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message and:

\- request specific LADN DNNs by including a LADN DNN value in the LADN
indication IE for each LADN DNN for which the UE requests LADN
information; or

\- to indicate a request for LADN information by not including any LADN
DNN value in the LADN indication IE.

The UE shall include the requested NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s)
corresponding to the slice(s) to which the UE intends to register with
and shall include the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the requested NSSAI, if
available, in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE has allowed
NSSAI or configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, the requested NSSAI
shall be either:

a\) the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN;

b\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or

c\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for
which no corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and those
are neither in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN nor in the
rejected NSSAI for the current registration area.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN nor configured
NSSAI for the current PLMN and has a default configured NSSAI, the UE
shall:

a\) include the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message using the default configured NSSAI; and

b\) include the Network slicing indication IE with the Default
configured NSSAI indication bit set to \"Requested NSSAI created from
default configured NSSAI\" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, no configured NSSAI
for the current PLMN, and no default configured NSSAI, the UE shall not
include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION message.

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the
current PLMN, if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN nor in the rejected NSSAI for the current registration
area.

The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of
one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN.

NOTE 3: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed
NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation specific.
The UE can take preferences indicated by the upper layers (e.g.
policies, applications) into account.

NOTE 4: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot
exceed eight.

If the UE initiates an initial registration for emergency services or
needs to prolong the established NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the initial registration procedure (e.g. due to uplink
signalling pending), the UE shall set the Follow-on request indicator to
1.

If the UE supports S1 mode, the UE shall:

\- set the S1 mode bit to \"S1 mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

\- include the S1 UE network capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message; and

\- if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\" to
transfer a PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode, set the HO attach bit to
\"attach request message containing PDN connectivity request with
request type set to handover to transfer PDU session from N1 mode to S1
mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

If the UE supports the LTE positioning protocol (LPP) in N1 mode as
specified in 3GPP TS 36.355 \[26\], the UE shall set the LPP bit to
\"LPP in N1 mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE has one or more stored UE policy sections identified by a UPSI
with the PLMN ID part indicating the HPLMN or the selected PLMN, the UE
shall include the UE STATE INDICATION message (see annex D) in the
Payload container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE does not have a valid 5G NAS security context, the UE shall
send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without including the NAS message
container IE. The UE shall set the Payload container type IE to \"UE
policy container\" and include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message
(i.e. containing cleartext IEs and non-cleartext IEs, if any) in the NAS
message container IE that is sent as part of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE
message as described in subclauses 4.4.6 and 5.4.2.3.

NOTE 1: In this version of the protocol, the UE can only include the
Payload container IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message to carry a
payload of type \"UE policy container\".

If the UE has a valid 5G NAS security context and the UE needs to send
non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall send a REGISTRATION REQUEST message
including the NAS message container IE as described in subclause 4.4.6.
If the UE does not need to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall send a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message without including the NAS message container
IE.

If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes a NAS message container IE,
the AMF shall process the REGISTRATION REQUEST message that is obtained
from the NAS message container IE as described in subclause 4.4.6.

Figure 5.5.1.2.2.1: Registration procedure for initial registration

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.3\]

The network may initiate 5GMM common procedures, e.g. the
identification, authentication and security procedures during the
registration procedure, depending on the information received in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

During a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to
\"emergency registration\", if the AMF is configured to support
emergency registration for unauthenticated SUCIs, the AMF may choose to
skip the authentication procedure even if no 5G NAS security context is
available and proceed directly to the execution of the security mode
control procedure.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

During a registration procedure with 5GS registration type IE set to
\"emergency registration\", the AMF shall not check for mobility and
access restrictions, regional restrictions or subscription restrictions,
when processing the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the initial registration request is accepted by the network, the AMF
shall send a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE.

For each of the information elements: 5GMM capability, S1 UE network
capability, and UE security capability, the AMF shall store all octets
received from the UE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, up to the
maximum length defined for the respective information element.

NOTE 1: This information is forwarded to the new AMF during inter-AMF
handover or to the new MME during inter-system handover to S1 mode.

The AMF shall assign and include a TAI list as a registration area the
UE is registered to in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE, upon
receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall delete its old TAI list
and store the received TAI list. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was
received over non-3GPP access, the AMF shall include only the N3GPP TAI
in the TAI list.

NOTE 2: The N3GPP TAI is operator-specific.

The AMF may include service area restrictions in the Service area list
IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE, upon receiving a
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the service area restrictions shall act
as described in subclause 5.3.5.

The AMF may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC).
The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if the
initial registration procedure is not for emergency services, the UE
shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs\". In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list
the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall
replace the stored list on each receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message. If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain a list,
then the UE shall delete the stored list.

If the initial registration procedure is not for emergency services, and
if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs\", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the
corresponding list(s).

If the Service area list IE is not included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message, any tracking area in the registered PLMN and its equivalent
PLMN(s) in the registration area is considered as an allowed tracking
area as described in subclause 5.3.5.

If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message contains the LADN indication IE,
based on the LADN indication IE, UE subscription information, UE
location and local configuration about LADN and:

\- if the LADN indication IE includes requested LADN DNNs, the UE
subscribed DNN list includes the requested LADN DNNs or the wildcard
DNN, and the LADN service area of the requested LADN DNN has an
intersection with the current registration area, the AMF shall determine
the requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE as LADN DNNs
for the UE;

\- if no requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE and the
wildcard DNN is included in the UE subscribed DNN list, the AMF shall
determine the LADN DNN(s) configured in the AMF whose LADN service area
has an intersection with the current registration area as LADN DNNs for
the UE; or

\- if no requested LADN DNNs included in the LADN indication IE and the
wildcard DNN is not included in the UE subscribed DNN list, the AMF
shall determine the LADN DNN(s) included in the UE subscribed DNN list
whose LADN service area has an intersection with the current
registration area as LADN DNNs for the UE.

If the LADN indication IE is not included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message, the AMF shall determine the LADN DNN(s) included in the UE
subscribed DNN list whose service area has an intersection with the
current registration area as LADN DNNs for the UE, except for the
wildcard DNN included in the UE subscribed DNN list.

The AMF shall include the LADN information which consists of the
determined LADN DNNs for the UE and LADN service area(s) available in
the current registration area in the LADN information IE of the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

The UE, upon receiving the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with the LADN
information, shall store the received LADN information. If there exists
one or more LADN DNNs which are included in the LADN indication IE of
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and are not included in the LADN
information IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE considers such
LADN DNNs as not available in the current registration area.

The 5G-GUTI reallocation shall be part of the initial registration
procedure. During the initial registration procedure, if the AMF has not
allocated a new 5G-GUTI by the generic UE configuration update
procedure, the AMF shall include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the
new assigned 5G-GUTI together with the assigned TAI list.

If a 5G-GUTI or the SOR transparent container IE is included in the
REGISTRATION ACCCEPT message, the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter
state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in
subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

If the Operator-defined access category definitions IE or the Extended
emergency number list IE is included in the REGISTRATION ACCCEPT
message, the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state
5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The AMF shall include the MICO indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message only if the MICO indication IE was included in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message, the AMF supports and accepts the use of MICO mode. If
the AMF supports and accepts the use of MICO mode, the AMF may indicate
\"all PLMN registration area allocated\" in the MICO indication IE in
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If \"all PLMN registration area
allocated\" is indicated in the MICO indication IE, the AMF shall not
assign and include the TAI list in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. If
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message included an MICO indication IE
indicating \"all PLMN registration area allocated\", the UE shall treat
all TAIs in the current PLMN as a registration area and delete its old
TAI list.

The AMF shall include the T3512 value IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message only if the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was sent over the 3GPP
access.

The AMF shall include the non-3GPP de-registration timer value IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message only if the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was
sent for the non-3GPP access.

Upon receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter, enter state 5GMM-REGISTERED and set the
5GS update status to 5U1 UPDATED.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message included a T3512 value IE, the UE
shall use the value in the T3512 value IE as periodic registration
update timer (T3512).

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message included a non-3GPP de-registration
timer value IE, the UE shall use the value in non-3GPP de-registration
timer value IE as non-3GPP de-registration timer.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contained a 5G-GUTI, the UE shall
return a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the AMF to acknowledge the
received 5G-GUTI, stop timer T3519 if running, and delete any stored
SUCI. The UE shall provide the 5G-GUTI to the lower layer of 3GPP access
if the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is sent over the non-3GPP access, and
the UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED in both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
the same PLMN.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains the Network slicing
indication IE with the Network slicing subscription change indication
set to \"Network slicing subscription changed\", or contains a
configured NSSAI IE with a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN and
optionally the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the configured NSSAI for the
current PLMN, the UE shall return a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the
AMF to acknowledge the successful update of the network slicing
information.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains the Operator-defined access
category definitions IE or the Extended emergency number list IE or
both, the UE shall return a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the AMF to
acknowledge reception of the operator-defined access category
definitions or the extended local emergency numbers list or both.

Upon receiving a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message, the AMF shall stop timer
T3550 and change to state 5GMM-REGISTERED. The 5G-GUTI, if sent in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall be considered as valid.

**ensure that** {

**when** { The UE is powered on }

**then** { MUSIM UE transmits REGISTRATION REQUEST message and sets one
or more MUSIM feature bits in 5GMM capability IE to \"supported\"

NAS signalling connection release, paging indication for voice services,
reject paging request, paging restriction) }

}

##### 9.1.5.1.16.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-31 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: 3GPP TS 24.501, clauses 4.25 and 5.5.1.2.2. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.25\]

A network and a MUSIM UE may support one or more of the MUSIM features
(i.e. the N1 NAS signalling connection release, the paging indication
for voice services, the reject paging request, the paging restriction
and the paging timing collision control).

If MUSIM UE supports one or more MUSIM features, the UE indicates
support of one or more MUSIM features (except for the paging timing
collision control) during the registration procedure. If the UE has
indicated support of the N1 NAS signalling connection release or the
reject paging request or both and the UE supports the paging
restriction, the UE indicates support of the paging restriction.

If the UE indicates support of one or more MUSIM features and the
network decides to accept one or more MUSIM features, the network
indicates the support of one or more MUSIM features during the
registration procedure. The network only indicates the support of the
paging restriction together with the support of either N1 NAS signalling
connection release or the reject paging request.

The network does not indicate support for any MUSIM feature to the UE
during the registration for emergency services.

If a UE stops fulfilling the condition to be considered a MUSIM UE as
defined in subclause 3.1, and the UE has negotiated support of one or
more MUSIM features, then the UE shall initiate a registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update to indicate that all the
MUSIM features are not supported (except for the paging timing collision
control) as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

...

If the MUSIM UE supports the N1 NAS signalling connection release, then
the UE shall set the N1 NAS signalling connection release bit to \"N1
NAS signalling connection release supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE
of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message otherwise the UE shall not set the
N1 NAS signalling connection release bit to \"N1 NAS signalling
connection release supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the MUSIM UE supports the paging indication for voice services, then
the UE shall set the paging indication for voice services bit to
\"paging indication for voice services supported\" in the 5GMM
capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message otherwise the UE shall
not set the paging indication for voice services bit to \"paging
indication for voice services supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the MUSIM UE supports the reject paging request, then the UE shall
set the reject paging request bit to \"reject paging request supported\"
in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message otherwise
the UE shall not set the reject paging request bit to \"reject paging
request supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

If the MUSIM UE sets:

\- the reject paging request bit to \"reject paging request supported\";

\- the N1 NAS signalling connection release bit to \"N1 NAS signalling
connection release supported\"; or

\- both of them;

and supports the paging restriction, then the UE shall set the paging
restriction bit to \"paging restriction supported\" in the 5GMM
capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message otherwise the UE shall
not set the paging restriction bit to \"paging restriction supported\"
in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

5.5.1.2.2 Initial registration initiation

...

If the UE supports UAS services, the UE shall set the UAS bit to \"UAS
services supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

When the UE supporting UAS services initiates an initial registration
for UAS services, the UE shall include the service-level device ID in
the Service-level-AA container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
and set the value to the CAA-level UAV ID. The UE shall include the
service-level-AA server address in the Service-level-AA container IE of
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and set the value to the USS address,
if it is provided by the upper layers.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

5.5.1.2.4 Initial registration accepted by the network

If the UE has included the service-level device ID set to the CAA-level
UAV ID in the Service-level-AA container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message, and if:

> \- the UE has a valid aerial UE subscription information;
>
> \- the UUAA procedure is to be performed during the registration
> procedure according to operator policy;
>
> \- there is no valid successful UUAA result for the UE in the UE 5GMM
> context; and
>
> \- the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was not received over non-3GPP
> access,

then the AMF shall initiate the UUAA-MM procedure with the UAS-NF as
specified in TS 23.256 \[6AB\] and shall include a service-level-AA
pending indication in the Service-level-AA container IE of the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The AMF shall store in the UE 5GMM context
that a UUAA procedure is pending. The AMF shall start timer T3550 and
enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in
subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was received
over non-3GPP access, the AMF shall not initiate UUAA-MM procedure.

...

If the UE has included the service-level device ID set to the CAA-level
UAV ID in the Service-level-AA container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message and the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains the service-levelAA
pending indication in the Service-level-AA container IE, the UE shall
return a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the AMF to acknowledge
reception of the service-level-AA pending indication, and the UE shall
not attempt to perform another registration procedure for UAS services
until the UUAA-MM procedure is completed, or to establish a PDU session
for USS communication or a PDU session for C2 communication until the
UUAA-MM procedure is completed successfully. If the UE has included the
service-level device ID set to the CAA-level UAV ID in the
Service-level-AA container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message does not contain the service-level-AA
pending indication in the Service-level-AA container IE, the UE shall
consider the UUAA-MM procedure is not triggered.

##### 9.1.5.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-33 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.3.2, 5.5.1.3.4. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by sending a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE detects entering a tracking area that is not in the list
of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the AMF;

\...

If case b) is the only reason for initiating the registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update, the UE shall indicate
\"periodic registration updating\" in the 5GS registration type IE;
otherwise the UE shall indicate \"mobility registration updating\".

\...

After sending the REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF the UE shall
start timer T3510. If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall
stop timer T3502. If timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop
timer T3511.

If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include
the last visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

The UE shall handle the 5GS mobility identity IE in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message as follows:

\...

b\) for all other cases, if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall
indicate the 5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE.

\...

When the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration
update is initiated in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE may include a PDU session
status IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, indicating which PDU
sessions associated with the access type the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message is sent over are active in the UE.

\...

Figure 5.5.1.3.2.1: Registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.4\]

The AMF shall assign and include a TAI list as a registration area the
UE is registered to in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The UE, upon
receiving a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall delete its old TAI list
and store the received TAI list. If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message was
received over non-3GPP access, the AMF shall include only the N3GPP TAI
in the TAI list.

\...

Upon receipt of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter, enter state 5GMM-REGISTERED and set the
5GS update status to 5U1 UPDATED.

\...

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains a 5G-GUTI, the UE shall
return a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the AMF to acknowledge the
received 5G-GUTI, stop timer T3519 if running, and delete any stored
SUCI.

##### 9.1.5.2.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-34 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.3.1, 5.5.1.3.2 and 5.5.1.3.4.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.1\]

This procedure is used by a UE for both mobility and periodic
registration update of 5GS services. This procedure, when used for
periodic registration update of 5GS services, is performed only in 3GPP
access.

This procedure used for periodic registration update of 5GS services is
controlled in the UE by timer T3512. When timer T3512 expires, the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration area
updating is started. Start and reset of timer T3512 is described in
subclause 10.2.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by sending a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE detects entering a tracking area that is not in the list
of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the AMF;

b\) when the periodic registration updating timer T3512 expires;

...

If item b) is the only reason for initiating the registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update, the UE shall indicate
\"periodic registration updating\" in the 5GS registration type IE;
otherwise the UE shall indicate \"mobility registration updating\".

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.4\]

...

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message included a T3512 value IE, the UE
shall use the value in T3512 value IE as periodic registration update
timer (T3512). If the T3512 value IE is not included, the UE shall use
the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message.

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED (and shall
store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any 5G-GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. The UE shall enter the
state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the rejected request was not for initiating an emergency PDU session,
the UE shall subsequently, automatically initiate the initial
registration procedure.

##### 9.1.5.2.10 Mobility registration update / MUSIM / NAS signalling connection release

##### 9.1.5.2.10 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-38 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-102 .H6}

**with** { UE configured to release the NAS signalling connection and
transmit REGISTRATION REQUEST message with request type IE set as "NAS
Signalling connection release" and Follow-on request indicator set to
"No follow-on request pending" }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE receives REGISTRATION ACCEPT message with "N1 NAS
signalling connection release supported" in 5GS network feature support
IE}

**then** { UE enters 5GMM-REGISTERED or 5GMM-IDLE state}

}

##### 9.1.5.2.10.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-38 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.3.2, 5.5.1.3.4. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by sending a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE detects entering a tracking area that is not in the list
of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the AMF;

\...

If case b) is the only reason for initiating the registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update, the UE shall indicate
\"periodic registration updating\" in the 5GS registration type IE;
otherwise, if the UE initiates the registration procedure for mobility
and periodic registration update due to case Zg), the UE shall indicate
\"disaster roaming mobility registration updating\" in the 5GS
registration type IE; otherwise the UE shall indicate \"mobility
registration updating\".

\...

If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include
the last visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

The UE shall handle the 5GS mobility identity IE in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message as follows:

\...

b\) for all other cases, if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall
indicate the 5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE.

\...

If the network supports the N1 NAS signalling connection release, and
the MUSIM UE requests the network to release the NAS signalling
connection, the UE shall set Request type to \"NAS signalling connection
release\" in the UE request type IE, set the Follow-on request indicator
to \"No follow-on request pending\" and, if the network supports the
paging restriction, may set the paging restriction preference in the
Paging restriction IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. In addition,
the UE shall not include the Uplink data status IE or the Allowed PDU
session status IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message even if the UE has
one or more active always-on PDU sessions associated with the 3GPP
access.

NOTE 15: If the network has already indicated support for N1 NAS
signalling connection release in the current stored registration area
and the UE doesn\'t have an emergency PDU session established, the MUSIM
UE is allowed to request the network to release the NAS signalling
connection during registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update that is due to mobility outside the registration
area even before detecting whether the network supports the N1 NAS
signalling connection release in the current TAI.

NOTE 16: If the network has already indicated support for paging
restriction in the current stored registration area and the UE doesn\'t
have an emergency PDU session established, the MUSIM UE is allowed to
include paging restriction together with the request to the network to
release the NAS signalling connection during registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update that is due to mobility
outside the registration area even before detecting whether the network
supports the paging restriction in the current TAI.

\...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.4\]

If the UE indicates support of the N1 NAS signalling connection release
in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the network decides to accept
the N1 NAS signalling connection release, then the AMF shall set the N1
NAS signalling connection release bit to \"N1 NAS signalling connection
release supported\" in the 5GS network feature support IE of the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

\...

If the MUSIM UE requests the release of the NAS signalling connection,
by setting Request type to \"NAS signalling connection release\" in the
UE request type IE included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, and the
AMF supports the N1 NAS signalling connection release, the AMF shall
initiate the release of the NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update.

##### 9.1.5.2.11.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-39 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.22.2, 5.5.1.2.2, 5.5.1.3.2 and
5.5.1.3.5. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

5.5.1.2.2 Initial registration initiation

...

If the UE supports UAS services, the UE shall set the UAS bit to \"UAS
services supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

When the UE supporting UAS services initiates an initial registration
for UAS services, the UE shall include the service-level device ID in
the Service-level-AA container IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
and set the value to the CAA-level UAV ID. The UE shall include the
service-level-AA server address in the Service-level-AA container IE of
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and set the value to the USS address,
if it is provided by the upper layers.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

5.5.1.3.2 Mobility and periodic registration update initiation

...

If the UE supports UAS services, the UE shall set the UAS bit to \"UAS
services supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.5\]

5.5.1.3.5 Mobility and periodic registration update not accepted by the
network

...

If the AMF receives the mobility and periodic registration update
request including the service-level device ID set to the CAA-level UAV
ID in the Service-level-AA container IE and the AMF determines that the
UE is not allowed to use UAS services via 5GS based on the user\'s
subscription data and the operator policy, the AMF shall return a
REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause \#79 (UAS services not
allowed).

...

\#79 (UAS services not allowed).

The UE shall abort the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update procedure, set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT
UPDATED and enter state 5GMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION-UPDATE.
Additionally, the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter. The
UE may re-attempt the registration procedure to the current PLMN for
services other than UAS services and shall not include the service-level
device ID set to the CAA-level UAV ID in the Service-level-AA container
IE of REGISTRATION REQUEST message unless the UE receives a
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message including the service-level-AA
service status indication in the Service-level-AA container IE with the
UAS field set to \"UAS services enabled\".

If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the EPS update
status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, reset the tracking area updating attempt
counter and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

##### 9.1.6.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-40 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.2.1, 5.5.2.2.1 and 5.5.2.2.6.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.1\]

The de-registration procedure is used:

a\) by the UE to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the
UE is registered over 3GPP access;;

b\) by the UE to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP
access, or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both
accesses;

c\) by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS
services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access;

d\) by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS
services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP access, or both when the UE is
registered in the same PLMN over both accesses; and

e\) by the network to inform the UE to re-register to the network.

The de-registration procedure with appropriate de-registration type
shall be invoked by the UE:

a\) if the UE is switched off; and

b\) as part of the eCall inactivity procedure defined in
subclause 5.5.3.

The de-registration procedure with appropriate de-registration type
shall be invoked by the network:

a\) if the network informs whether the UE should re-register to the
network.

The de-registration procedure with appropriate access type shall be
invoked by the UE:

a\) if the UE wants to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access
when the UE is registered over 3GPP access; or

b\) the UE wants to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access,
non-3GPP access, or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over
both accesses.

If the de-registration procedure is triggered due to USIM removal, the
UE shall indicate \"switch off\" in the de-registration type IE.

If the de-registration procedure is requested by the UDM for a UE that
has an emergency PDU session, the AMF shall not send a DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message to the UE.

If the de-registration procedure for 5GS services is performed, the PDU
sessions, if any, for this particular UE are released locally without
peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the network.

The UE is allowed to initiate the de-registration procedure even if the
timer T3346 is running.

NOTE: When the UE has no PDU sessions over non-3GPP access, or the UE
moves all the PDU sessions over a non-3GPP access to a 3GPP access, the
UE and the AMF need not initiate de-registration over the non-3GPP
access.

The AMF shall provide the UE with a non-3GPP de-registration timer.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.2.1\]

The de-registration procedure is initiated by the UE by sending a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message (see example in figure 5.5.2.2.1). The
De-registration type IE included in the message indicates whether the
de-registration procedure is due to a \"switch off\" or not. The access
type included in the message indicates whether the de-registration
procedure is:

a\) for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over
3GPP access only;

b\) for 5GS services over non-3GPP access when the UE is registered over
non-3GPP access only; or

c\) for 5GS services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access when the UE is registered in the same PLMN
over both accesses.

If the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile
identity IE with the valid 5G-GUTI. If the UE does not have a valid
5G-GUTI, the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile identity IE with its SUCI.

If the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI and it does not have a valid
SUCI, then the UE shall populate the5GSmobile identity IE with its PEI.

If the de-registration request is not due to switch off and the UE is in
the state 5GMM-REGISTERED or 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED, timer T3521
shall be started in the UE after the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has
been sent. The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED.

If the UE is to be switched off, the UE shall try for a period of 5
seconds to send the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. During this period,
the UE may be switched off as soon as the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message
has been sent.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.2.6\]

...

d\) De-registration procedure collision.

De-registration containing de-registration type \"switch off\":

\- If the UE receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message before the
UE-initiated de-registration procedure has been completed, this message
shall be ignored and the UE-initiated de-registration procedure shall
continue.

Otherwise:

\- If the UE receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message before the
UE-initiated de-registration procedure has been completed, it shall
treat the message as specified in subclause 5.5.2.3.2 with the following
modification:

\- If the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message received by the UE contains
de-registration type \"re-registration required\", and the UE-initiated
de-registration procedure is with de-registration type \"normal
de-registration\", the UE need not initiate the registration procedure
for initial registration.

e\) De-registration and 5GMM common procedure collision.

De-registration containing de-registration type \"switch off\":

\- If the UE receives a message used in a 5GMM common procedure before
the de-registration procedure has been completed, this message shall be
ignored and the de-registration procedure shall continue.

Otherwise:

\- If the UE receives a message used in a 5GMM common procedure before
the de-registration procedure has been completed, both the 5GMM common
procedure and the de-registration procedure shall continue.

##### 9.1.6.1.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-41 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clause 5.5.2.2.6 and TS 38.331 clause 5.7.2.4.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.2.6\]

c\) T3521 timeout.

On the first four expiries of the timer, the UE shall retransmit the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message and shall reset and restart timer T3521.
On the fifth expiry of timer T3521, the de-registration procedure shall
be aborted and the UE proceeds as follows:

1\) if the de-registration procedure was performed due to disabling of
5GS services, the UE shall enter the 5GMM-NULL state; or

2\) if the de-registration type \"normal de-registration\" was requested
for reasons other than disabling of 5GS services, the UE shall enter the
5GMM-DEREGISTERED state.

...

e\) De-registration and 5GMM common procedure collision.

De-registration containing de-registration type \"switch off\":

\- If the UE receives a message used in a 5GMM common procedure before
the de-registration procedure has been completed, this message shall be
ignored and the de-registration procedure shall continue.

Otherwise:

\- If the UE receives a message used in a 5GMM common procedure before
the de-registration procedure has been completed, both the 5GMM common
procedure and the de-registration procedure shall continue.

h\) Transmission failure of DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indication
without TAI change from lower layers.

The UE shall restart the de-registration procedure.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.7.2.4\]

The UE shall:

1\> if AS security is not started and radio link failure occurs before
the successful delivery of ULInformationTransfer messages has been
confirmed by lower layers; or

1\> if mobility (i.e. handover, RRC connection re-establishment) occurs
before the successful delivery of ULInformationTransfer messages has
been confirmed by lower layers:

2\> inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the
information contained in the concerned ULInformationTransfer messages.

##### 9.1.6.1.3 UE-initiated de-registration / Abnormal / Change of cell into a new tracking area

##### 9.1.6.1.3.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-42 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-113 .H6}

**with** { UE in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED state and de-registration
request is not due to switch off }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE changes into a new tracking area that is not in the stored
TAI list }

**then** { UE aborts the de-registration procedure and initiates a
mobility registration procedure }

}

##### (2) {#section-114 .H6}

**with** { UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED state for a mobility
registration procedure due to change of cell into a new tracking area
list during UE-initiated de-registration procedure }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE receives REGISTRATION ACCEPT message }

**then** { UE re-initiates the de-registration procedure after
completing the mobility registration procedure }

}

##### (3) {#section-115 .H6}

**Void**

##### 9.1.6.1.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-42 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.2.6. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.2.2.6\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

...

f\) Change of cell into a new tracking area.

If a cell change into a new tracking area that is not in the stored TAI
list occurs before the UE-initiated de-registration procedure is
completed, the de-registration procedure shall be aborted and
re-initiated after successfully performing a registration procedure for
mobility or periodic update used for mobility (i.e. the 5GS registration
type IE set to \"mobility registration updating\" in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message). If the de-registration procedure was initiated due to
removal of the USIM or the UE is to be switched off, the UE shall abort
the de-registration procedure and enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

##### 9.1.6.1.3.3 Test description {#test-description-42 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-116 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state }

**ensure that** {

**when** { the SS sends a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates
\"re-registration required\" and the de-registration request is for 3GPP
access }

**then** { the UE sends a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the network
and releases the existing NAS signalling connection, then initiates an
initial registration and also re-establishes any previously established
PDU sessions. }

}

##### 9.1.6.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-43 .H6}

References: The conformance requirement covered in the present TC is
specified in: 3GPP TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.2.3.2. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause5.5.2.3.2\]

NOTE 1: When the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration
required\", user interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE
cannot re-establish the PDU session (s), if any, automatically.

...

Upon sending a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall delete the
rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration required\", then
the UE shall ignore the 5GMM cause IE if received.

If the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration not required\",
the UE shall take the actions depending on the received 5GMM cause
value:

\#3 (Illegal UE);

...

As an implementation option, the UE may enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.22.2, 5.5.2.1 and 5.5.2.3.1. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.22.2\]

The 5GS supports the USS UAV Authorization and Authentication (UUAA)
procedure for a UE supporting UAS services. Depending on operator policy
or regulatory requirements, the UUAA-MM procedure can be performed by
the UE and the AMF at a registration procedure as specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2 or the UUAA-SM procedure can be performed by the UE
and the SMF at a PDU session establishment procedure as specified in
subclause 6.4.1.2. The UE shall support UUAA-MM and UUAA-SM, and the
network shall support UUAA-SM and may optionally support UUAA-MM. The
UUAA procedure needs to be performed by 5GS with USS successfully before
the connectivity for UAS services is established.

During the registration procedure as described in subclause 5.5.1.2, the
UE supporting UAS services provides CAA-level UAV ID to the AMF, and the
AMF may trigger the UUAA-MM procedure. If the UE supporting UAS services
does not provide CAA-level UAV ID to the AMF and the network is
configured to perform UUAA-MM at registration procedure, the AMF may
accept the registration request and shall mark in the UE\'s 5GMM context
that the UE is not allowed to request UAS services. If the UE wants to
use the UAS services by providing the CAA-Level UAV ID later on, the UE
shall perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update.

When a UE supporting UAS services requests to establish a PDU session as
described in subclause 6.4.1.2 for USS communication, the UE provides
CAA-level UAV ID to the network, and the SMF may trigger the UUAA-SM
procedure based on the DNN and S-NSSAI combination for aerial services
according to the user\'s subscription data and the CAA-level UAV ID
provided by the UE.

...

After successful UUAA procedure, either the AMF or the SMF may initiate
re-authentication of the UAV when required by the USS. If UUAA-MM fails
during a re-authentication and there are PDU sessions established using
UAS services, the AMF shall request the SMF to perform the release of
these PDU sessions and may trigger a network-initiated de-registration
procedure based on operator policy. If UUAA-SM fails during a
re-authentication, the SMF shall release the PDU session related to
re-authentication.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.1\]

The de-registration procedure is used:

...

h\) by the network to inform the UE supporting UAS service that it is
deregistered for UAS services in 5GS.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.3.1\]

The network initiates the de-registration procedure by sending a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE (see example in
figure 5.5.2.3.1.1).

NOTE 1: If the AMF performs a local de-registration, it will inform the
UE with a 5GMM messages (e.g. SERVICE REJECT message or REGISTRATION
REJECT message) with 5GMM cause \#10 \"implicitly de-registered\" only
when the UE initiates a 5GMM procedure.

The network may include a 5GMM cause IE to specify the reason for the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. The network shall start timer T3522. The
network shall indicate whether re-registration is needed or not in the
De-registration type IE. The network shall also indicate via the access
type whether the de-registration procedure is:

a\) for 3GPP access only;

b\) for non-3GPP access only; or

c\) for 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both when the UE is registered
in the same PLMN for both accesses.

...

If the network de-registration is triggered due to:

a\) an unsuccessful outcome of an ongoing UUAA-MM procedure;

...

c\) the UE not allowed to use UAS services via 5GS due to a change of
the aerial UE subscription information,

then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message to \#79 \"UAS services not allowed\".

NOTE 3: If the UE supporting UAS service has requested other services
than UAS services, or if there are other ongoing network slice-specific
authentication and authorization on pending NSSAIs, it is then an
operator policy or configuration decision whether to keep the UE
supporting UAS service registered to the network, but that UE supporting
UAS services is not allowed to access UAS services via 5GS as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.256 \[6AB\].

...

The AMF shall trigger the SMF to release locally the PDU session(s) over
the indicated access(es), if any, for the UE and enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED. If a PDU session is associated with one or
more multicast MBS sessions, the SMF shall consider the UE as removed
from the associated multicast MBS sessions.

Figure 5.5.2.3.1.1: Network-initiated de-registration procedure

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.2\]

Upon receipt of the result of the UUAA-MM procedure from the UAS-NF, the
AMF shall include:

a\) the service-level-AA response with the SLAR field set to:

1\) \"Service level authentication and authorization was successful\" if
the AMF detects the UUAA-MM procedure has succeeded; or

2\) \"Service level authentication and authorization was not successful
or service level authorization is revoked\" if the AMF detects the
UUAA-MM procedure has failed;

b\) if the CAA-Level UAV ID is provided by the UAS-NF, the service-level
device ID with the value set to the CAA-Level UAV ID; and;

c\) if a payload is received from the UAS-NF:

1\) the service-level-AA payload with the value set to the payload; and

2\) if a payload type associated with the payload is received, the
service-level-AA payload type with the values set to the payload type;
and

3\) if the payload type associated with the payload is for C2
authorization payload, the service-level-AA response with C2AR field set
to either \"C2 authorization was successful\" or \"C2 authorization was
not successful or C2 authorization is revoked\" according to the
authorization result received from the UAS-NF;

in the Service-level-AA container IE of the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message.

##### 9.1.7.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-46 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.1, 5.6.1.5 and 5.6.1.7. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.1\]

The purpose of the service request procedure is to change the 5GMM mode
from 5GMM-IDLE to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, and/or to request the
establishment of user-plane resources for PDU sessions which are
established without user-plane resources. In latter case, the 5GMM mode
can be the 5GMM-IDLE mode or the 5GMM-CONNECTED mode if the UE requires
to establish user-plane resources for PDU sessions.

...

The UE shall invoke the service request procedure when:

...

d\) the UE, in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access, has uplink user data
pending;

\...

If one of the above criteria to invoke the service request procedure is
fulfilled, then the service request procedure shall only be initiated by
the UE when the following conditions are fulfilled:

\- its 5GS update status is 5U1 UPDATED, and the TAI of the current
serving cell is included in the TAI list; and

\- no 5GMM specific procedure is ongoing.

The UE shall not invoke the service request procedure when the UE is in
the state 5GMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED.

Figure 5.6.1.1.1: Service Request procedure

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.5\]

If the service request cannot be accepted, the network shall return a
SERVICE REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate 5GMM cause
value and stop timer T3517.

...

If the AMF determines that the UE is in a non-allowed area or is not in
an allowed area as specified in subclause 5.3.5, then:

a\) if the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message is set to
\"signalling\" or \"data\", the AMF shall send a SERVICE REJECT message
with the 5GMM cause value set to \#28 \"Restricted service area\";

...

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the SERVICE REJECT message.

\#28 (Restricted service area).

The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE, and
perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update unless the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST
message was set to \"elevated signalling\" (see subclause 5.3.5 and
5.5.1.3).

If the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message was set to
\"elevated signalling\", the UE shall not re-initiate service request
procedure until the UE enters an allowed area or leaves a non-allowed
area, except for emergency services, high priority access or responding
to paging or notification.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.7\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) T3517 expired.

The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.

If the UE triggered the service request procedure in 5GMM-IDLE mode and
the service type of the SERVICE REQUEST message was not set to
\"emergency services fallback\", then the 5GMM sublayer shall increment
the service request attempt counter, abort the procedure and release
locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure. The
service request attempt counter shall not be incremented, if:

1\) the service request procedure is initiated to establish an emergency
PDU session;

2\) the UE has an emergency PDU session established;

3\) the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN;
or

4\) the service request is initiated in response to paging or
notification from the network.

If the service request attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5,
the UE shall start timer T3525. Additionally, if the service request was
initiated for an MO MMTEL voice call, a notification that the service
request was not accepted due to the UE having started timer T3525 shall
be provided to the upper layers.

NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers requesting implementation
specific mechanisms, e.g. the MMTEL voice call being attempted to
another IP-CAN, or establishment of a CS voice call (if supported and
not already attempted in the CS domain).

The UE shall not attempt service request until expiry of timer T3525
unless:

1\) the service request is initiated in response to paging or
notification from the network;

2 the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN;

3\) the service request is initiated to establish an emergency PDU
session;

4\) the UE has an emergency PDU session established; or

5\) the UE is registered in a new PLMN.

NOTE 2: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE
deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified
in subclause 5.4.1.3.7.

##### 9.1.7.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-47 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.6.1.1, 5.6.1.2 and 5.6.1.7. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.1\]

The purpose of the service request procedure is to change the 5GMM mode
from 5GMM-IDLE to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, and/or to request the
establishment of user-plane resources for PDU sessions which are
established without user-plane resources. In latter case, the 5GMM mode
can be the 5GMM-IDLE mode or the 5GMM-CONNECTED mode if the UE requires
to establish user-plane resources for PDU sessions.

NOTE 1: The lower layer indicates when the user-plane resources for PDU
sessions are successfully established or released.

This procedure is used when:

...

\- the UE has user data pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in
5GMM-IDLE or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access;

The UE shall invoke the service request procedure when:

...

e\) the UE, in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication, has user data pending due to no user-plane
resources established for PDU session(s) used for user data transport;

Figure 5.6.1.1.1: Service Request procedure

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.2\]

The UE initiates the service request procedure by sending a SERVICE
REQUEST message to the AMF and starts timer T3517.

...

For cases d) and e) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the Uplink data status IE
shall be included in the SERVICE REQUEST message to indicate the PDU
session(s) the UE has pending user data to be sent. If the UE is not a
UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN:

a\) if there exists an emergency PDU session which is indicated in the
Uplink data status IE the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message
shall be set to \"emergency services\"; or

b\) otherwise, the service type IE in the SERVICE REQUEST message shall
be set to \"data\".

...

The Uplink data status IE may be included in the SERVICE REQUEST message
to indicate which PDU session(s) associated with the access type the
SERVICE REQUEST message is sent over have pending user data to be sent.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.7\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) T3517 expired.

The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.

If the UE triggered the service request procedure in 5GMM-IDLE mode and
the service type of the SERVICE REQUEST message was not set to
\"emergency services fallback\", then the 5GMM sublayer shall increment
the service request attempt counter, abort the procedure and release
locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure. The
service request attempt counter shall not be incremented, if:

1\) the service request procedure is initiated to establish an emergency
PDU session;

2\) the UE has an emergency PDU session established;

3\) the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN;
or

4\) the service request is initiated in response to paging or
notification from the network.

If the service request attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5,
the UE shall start timer T3525. Additionally, if the service request was
initiated for an MO MMTEL voice call, a notification that the service
request was not accepted due to the UE having started timer T3525 shall
be provided to the upper layers.

NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers requesting implementation
specific mechanisms, e.g. the MMTEL voice call being attempted to
another IP-CAN, or establishment of a CS voice call (if supported and
not already attempted in the CS domain).

The UE shall not attempt service request until expiry of timer T3525
unless:

1\) the service request is initiated in response to paging or
notification from the network;

2\) the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN;

3\) the service request is initiated to establish an emergency PDU
session;

4\) the UE has an emergency PDU session established; or

5\) the UE is registered in a new PLMN.

NOTE 2: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE
deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified
in subclause 5.4.1.3.7.

##### 9.1.7.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-48 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.6.1.1, 5.6.1.2.1, and 5.6.1.4.1 and
in TS 36.331, clause 5.3.3.4.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.1\]

The purpose of the service request procedure is to change the 5GMM mode
from 5GMM-IDLE to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.

...

The UE shall invoke the service request procedure when:

...

o\) the network supports the N1 NAS signalling connection release, the
MUSIM UE,

\- is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, requests the network to release the NAS
signalling connection and, if the network supports the paging
restriction, optionally includes paging restriction;

\- is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication, requests the
network to release the NAS signalling connection and, if the network
supports the paging restriction, optionally includes paging restriction;
or

\- is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication, rejects the
RAN paging, requests the network to release the NAS signalling
connection and, if the network supports the paging restriction,
optionally includes paging restriction; or

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.2.1\]

...

For cases o and p in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall not include the
Uplink data status IE and the Allowed PDU session status IE in the
SERVICE REQUEST message. Further,

\- for case o in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall set Request type to
\"NAS signalling connection release\" in the UE request type IE and
Service type to \"signalling\";

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.4.1\]

For cases other than h) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the
reception of the SERVICE ACCEPT message as successful completion of the
procedure. The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop
timer T3517 and enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.

...

the AMF shall initiate the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection
as follows:

\- for case o in subclause 5.6.1.1, after the completion of the service
request procedure;

##### 9.1.7.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-49 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.6.1.1, 5.6.2.2.1 and 5.6.1.4.1. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.1\]

...

p\) the network supports the reject paging request, the MUSIM UE in
5GMM-IDLE mode when responding to paging rejects the paging request from
the network, requests the network to release the NAS signalling
connection and, if the network supports the paging restriction,
optionally includes paging restriction

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.2.2.1\]

...

The MUSIM UE based on implementation may use the paging cause indicated
by lower layers (see 3GPP TS 38.331 \[30\]), if any, to accept the
paging, reject the paging or ignore the paging indication.

Upon reception of a paging indication, if the network supports the
rejection of paging request and if a MUSIM UE decides not to accept the
paging, the UE may initiate a service request procedure to reject the
paging as specified in clause 5.6.1.1

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.6.1.4.1\]

For cases other than h) in subclause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the
reception of the SERVICE ACCEPT message as successful completion of the
procedure. The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop
timer T3517 and enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.

##### 9.1.8.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-50 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2, 5.5.1.2.4, 5.5.1.3.2,
5.5.1.3.4, 9.11.3.6 and 9.11.3.9A. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE performs initial registration for 5GS services;

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

c\) when the UE performs initial registration for SMS over NAS; and

d\) when the UE moves from GERAN to NG-RAN coverage or the UE moves from
a UTRAN to NG-RAN coverage.

...

The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by
sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, starting timer T3510.
If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3502. If
timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.

...

If the UE requests the use of SMS over NAS, the UE shall include the 5GS
update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the SMS
requested bit set to "SMS over NAS supported". When the 5GS update type
IE is included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST for reasons other than
requesting the use of SMS over NAS, and the UE does not need to register
for SMS over NAS, the UE shall set the SMS requested bit of the 5GS
update type IE to "SMS over NAS not supported" in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the initial registration request is accepted by the network, the AMF
shall send a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE.

...

If the 5GS update type IE was included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message with the SMS requested bit set to "SMS over NAS supported", and
SMSF selection is successful, then the AMF shall send the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message after the SMSF has confirmed that the activation of the
SMS service was successful. When sending the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message, the AMF shall:

a\) set the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration result IE to "SMS
over NAS allowed" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, if the UE has set
the SMS requested bit of the 5GS registration type IE to "SMS over NAS
supported" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the network allows
the use of SMS over NAS for the UE; and

b\) store the SMSF address and the value of the SMS allowed bit of the
5GS registration result IE in the UE 5GMM context and consider the UE
available for SMS over NAS.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by sending a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF,

l\) when the UE needs to register for SMS over NAS, indicate a change in
the requirements to use SMS over NAS, or de-register from SMS over NAS;

...

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic update by sending a REGISTRATION
REQUEST message to the AMF when the UE needs to request the use of SMS
over NAS transport or the current requirements to use SMS over NAS
transport change in the UE. The UE shall set the SMS requested bit of
the 5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified
in subclause 5.5.1.2.2.

When initiating a registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update and the UE needs to send the 5GS update type IE for
a reason different than indicating a change in requirement to use SMS
over NAS, the UE shall set the SMS requested bit of the 5GS update type
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the same value as indicated by
the UE in the last REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE no longer requires the use of SMS over NAS, then the UE shall
include the 5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with
the SMS requested bit set to "SMS over NAS not supported".

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.3.4\]

If the registration update request has been accepted by the network, the
AMF shall send a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE.

...

If the 5GS update type IE was included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message with the SMS requested bit set to "SMS over NAS not supported"
and:

a\) the SMSF address is stored in the UE 5GMM context and:

1\) the UE is considered available for SMS over NAS; or

2\) the UE is considered not available for SMS over NAS and the SMSF has
confirmed that the activation of the SMS service is successful; or

b\) the SMSF address is not stored in the UE 5GMM context, the SMSF
selection is successful and the SMSF has confirmed that the activation
of the SMS service is successful;

then the AMF shall set the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration
result IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2.4. If the UE 5GMM context does not contain an SMSF
address or the UE is not considered available for SMS over NAS, then the
AMF shall:

a\) store the SMSF address in the UE 5GMM context if not stored already;
and

b\) store the value of the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration
result IE in the UE 5GMM context and consider the UE available for SMS
over NAS.

If SMSF selection in the AMF or SMS activation via the SMSF is not
successful, or the AMF does not allow the use of SMS over NAS, then the
AMF shall set the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration result IE to
"SMS over NAS not allowed\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

If the 5GS update type IE was included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message with the SMS requested bit set to \"SMS over NAS not
supported\", then the AMF shall:

a\) mark the 5GMM context to indicate that the UE is not available for
SMS over NAS; and

NOTE 2: The AMF can notify the SMSF that the UE is deregistered from SMS
over NAS based on local configuration.

b\) set the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration result IE to \"SMS
over NAS not supported\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

When the UE receives the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, if the UE is also
registered over another access to the same PLMN, the UE considers the
value indicated by the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration result IE
as applicable for both accesses over which the UE is registered.

##### 9.1.8.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-51 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clause 4.5.4.2, and TS 24.011 clause 9.11.3.9A.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 4.5.4.2\]

If the lower layers indicate that the access attempt is allowed, the NAS
shall take the following action depending on the event which triggered
the access attempt:

a\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was an
MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started
indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication, the NAS shall
notify the upper layers that the access attempt is allowed;

b\) if the event which triggered the access attempt was a request from
upper layers to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS, 5GMM shall
initiate the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5 to
send the SMS in an UL NAS TRANSPORT message;

\[TS 24.011 clause 5.4\]

In the case of a SMS transfer via the PS domain, when the MS chooses to
use the same PS signalling connection (in Iu mode and in S1 mode if
packet-switched service is used); or in the case of a SMS transfer via
the PS domain in A/Gb mode; or in the case of SMS transfer through the
EPS, or in the case of SMS transfer in N1 mode, then:

\- the MS shall transmit the CP-DATA for the successive RPDU and shall
not transmit the final CP‑ACK for the current SMS (i.e. the one that
acknowledges the CP‑DATA that carried the RP‑ACK);

\- the Transaction Identifier used for the successive RPDU shall be
different to that used for the current RPDU; and

\- the MS shall not transmit the CP-DATA for the successive RPDU before
the final CP‑DATA (i.e. the one that carried the RP‑ACK) has been
received.

NOTE: When an MS sends successive memory available notifications and/or
mobile originated short messages on different RR connections (in A/Gb
mode) or signalling connections (in Iu mode and S1 mode), the MS is
strongly recommended to use different Transaction Identifiers for the
old and new MM connections.

It is possible that the final CP‑ACK of a short message transfer may not
be received (e.g. due to transmission errors and/or hand overs).

For mobile terminated transfers, if the CP‑ACK is lost, the reception of
a CP‑DATA with a different transaction identifier and carrying an RPDU
shall be interpreted as the implicit reception of the awaited CP‑ACK
followed by the reception of the new CP‑DATA message.

For mobile originated transfers, if the CP‑ACK is lost or not sent by
the MS, the following events shall be interpreted as the implicit
reception of the awaited CP‑ACK:

\- in the case of a SMS transfer via the CS domain,, the reception of a
CM SERVICE REQUEST followed by a CP‑DATA with a different transaction
identifier and carrying an RPDU; or

\- in the case of a SMS transfer via the PS domain, the reception of a
CP-DATA with a different transaction identifier and carrying an RPDU.

##### 9.1.9.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-52 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.16, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.4.2, 5.4.4.3,
5.4.4.4, 5.5.1.3.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16
requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.16\]

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to
represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the
UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is applicable to neither
NB-N1 mode nor non-3GPP access.

If the UE supports RACS:

a\) the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
\"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message;

b\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for initial registration
and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE
radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE
radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a non-cleartext
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a network-assigned UE
radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
are applicable, the UE shall include the network-assigned UE radio
capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

...

g\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update due to entering a tracking area that is not
in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the
AMF and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current
UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the
UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a
non-cleartext IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a
network-assigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID are applicable, the UE shall include the
network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

If the network supports RACS:

a\) the network may assign a network-assigned UE radio capability ID to
a UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message;

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to:

a\) allow the AMF to update the UE configuration for access and mobility
management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF by
providing new parameter information within the command; or

b\) request the UE to perform a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update towards the network to update access and
mobility management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF
(see subclause 5.5.1.3).

##### 9.1.9.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-53 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.16, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.4.2, 5.4.4.3,
5.4.4.4, 5.5.1.3.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16
requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.16\]

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to
represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the
UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is applicable to neither
NB-N1 mode nor non-3GPP access.

If the UE supports RACS:

a\) the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
\"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message;

b\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for initial registration
and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE
radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE
radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a non-cleartext
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a network-assigned UE
radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
are applicable, the UE shall include the network-assigned UE radio
capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

\...

d\) upon receiving a network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message,
the UE shall store the network-assigned UE radio capability ID and the
PLMN ID or SNPN identity of the serving network along with a mapping to
the current UE radio configuration in its non-volatile memory as
specified in annex C. The UE shall be able to store at least the last 16
received network-assigned UE radio capability IDs with the associated
PLMN ID or SNPN identity and the mapping to the corresponding UE radio
configuration;

...

g\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update due to entering a tracking area that is not
in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the
AMF and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current
UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the
UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a
non-cleartext IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a
network-assigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID are applicable, the UE shall include the
network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

If the network supports RACS:

a\) the network may assign a network-assigned UE radio capability ID to
a UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message;

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to:

a\) allow the AMF to update the UE configuration for access and mobility
management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF by
providing new parameter information within the command; or

b\) request the UE to perform a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update towards the network to update access and
mobility management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF
(see subclause 5.5.1.3).

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.2\]

The AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure by
sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.

The AMF shall in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message either:

a\) include one or more of the following parameters: 5G-GUTI, TAI list,
allowed NSSAI that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), LADN information,
service area list, MICO indication, NITZ information, configured NSSAI
that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), rejected NSSAI, network slicing
subscription change indication, operator-defined access category
definitions, SMS indication, service gap time value, \"CAG information
list\", UE radio capability ID, 5GS registration result, UE radio
capability ID deletion indication or truncated 5G-S-TMSI configuration;

b\) include the Configuration update indication IE with the Registration
requested bit set to \"registration requested\"; or

c\) include a combination of both a) and b).

If an acknowledgement from the UE is requested, the AMF shall indicate
\"acknowledgement requested\" in the Acknowledgement bit of the
Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message and shall start timer T3555. Acknowledgement shall be requested
for all parameters except when only NITZ is included.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.3\]

Upon receiving the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall
stop timer T3346 if running and use the contents to update appropriate
information stored within the UE.

If \"acknowledgement requested\" is indicated in the Acknowledgement bit
of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE
message.

...

If the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS
supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message and the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message includes:

a\) a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
\"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\", the UE
shall delete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated
with the RPLMN or RSNPN stored at the UE; and

b\) a UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall store the UE radio
capability ID as specified in annex C

**when** { UE enters a new tracking area that is not in the list of
tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the AMF }

**then** { UE sends REGISTRATION REQUEST message including the
manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID }

}

##### (2) {#section-142 .H6}

**with** { UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED and 5GMM-IDLE mode and having
assigned a new UE Radio Capability ID in the Registration Accept message
}

ensure that {

**when** { UE moves to cell belong to another equivalent PLMN }

**then** { UE sends REGISTRATION REQUEST message including the
manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID }

}

##### 9.1.9.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-54 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.16, 5.5.1.3. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.16\]

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to
represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the
UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is applicable to neither
NB-N1 mode nor non-3GPP access.

If the UE supports RACS:

a\) the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
\"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message;

b\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for initial registration
and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE
radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE
radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a non-cleartext
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a network-assigned UE
radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
are applicable, the UE shall include the network-assigned UE radio
capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

...

e\) the UE shall not use a network-assigned UE radio capability ID
assigned by a PLMN in PLMNs equivalent to the PLMN which assigned it;

f\) upon receiving a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set
to \"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\" in
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall delete all network-assigned UE radio capability
IDs stored at the UE for the serving network, initiate a registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and include an
applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID for the current
UE radio configuration, if available at the UE, in the UE radio
capability ID IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message; and

g\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update due to entering a tracking area that is not
in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the
AMF and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current
UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the
UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a
non-cleartext IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a
network-assigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID are applicable, the UE shall include the
network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

If the network supports RACS:

a\) the network may assign a network-assigned UE radio capability ID to
a UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message;

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3\]

When the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, if the UE supports RACS, the UE shall:

a\) set the RACS bit to \"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

b\) if the UE has an applicable network-assigned UE radio capability ID
for the current UE radio configuration in the selected PLMN or SNPN,
include the applicable network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the UE
radio capability ID IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message; and

c\) if the UE:

1\) does not have an applicable network-assigned UE radio capability ID
for the current UE radio configuration in the selected PLMN or SNPN; and

2\) has an applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID for
the current UE radio configuration,

include the applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID in
the UE radio capability ID IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

##### 9.1.9.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-55 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 4.16, Annex C. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.16\]

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to
represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the
UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is applicable to neither
NB-N1 mode nor non-3GPP access.

If the UE supports RACS:

a\) the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
\"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message;

b\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for initial registration
and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE
radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE
radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a non-cleartext
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a network-assigned UE
radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
are applicable, the UE shall include the network-assigned UE radio
capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

If the network supports RACS:

a\) the network may assign a network-assigned UE radio capability ID to
a UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message;

\[TS 24.501, Annex C\]

The following 5GMM parameters shall be stored in a non-volatile memory
in the ME together with the SUPI from the USIM:

\- configured NSSAI(s);

\- NSSRG information;

\- NSSAI inclusion mode(s);

\- MPS indicator;

\- MCS indicator;

\- operator-defined access category definitions;

\- network-assigned UE radio capability IDs;

...

Each network-assigned UE radio capability ID is stored together with a
PLMN identity of the PLMN that provided it as well as a mapping to the
corresponding UE radio configuration, and is valid in that PLMN. A
network-assigned UE radio capability ID can only be used if the SUPI
from the USIM matches the SUPI stored in the non-volatile memory of the
ME, else the UE shall delete the network-assigned UE radio capability
ID.

##### 9.1.9.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-56 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 4.16, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.4.2, 5.4.4.3,
5.5.1.2.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.16\]

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to
represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the
UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is applicable to neither
NB-N1 mode nor non-3GPP access.

If the UE supports RACS:

a\) the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
\"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message;

b\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for initial registration
and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE
radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE
radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a non-cleartext
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a network-assigned UE
radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
are applicable, the UE shall include the network-assigned UE radio
capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

\...

d\) upon receiving a network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message,
the UE shall store the network-assigned UE radio capability ID and the
PLMN ID or SNPN identity of the serving network along with a mapping to
the current UE radio configuration in its non-volatile memory as
specified in annex C. The UE shall be able to store at least the last 16
received network-assigned UE radio capability IDs with the associated
PLMN ID or SNPN identity and the mapping to the corresponding UE radio
configuration;

...

f\) upon receiving a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set
to \"delete network-assigned UE radio capability IDs\" in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message,
the UE shall delete all network-assigned UE radio capability IDs stored
at the UE for the serving network, initiate a registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update and include an applicable
manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio
configuration, if available at the UE, in the UE radio capability ID IE
of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message; and

g\) if the UE performs a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update due to entering a tracking area that is not
in the list of tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the
AMF and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current
UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the
UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE as a
non-cleartext IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If both a
network-assigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID are applicable, the UE shall include the
network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

If the network supports RACS:

a\) the network may assign a network-assigned UE radio capability ID to
a UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message;

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to:

a\) allow the AMF to update the UE configuration for access and mobility
management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF by
providing new parameter information within the command; or

b\) request the UE to perform a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update towards the network to update access and
mobility management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF
(see subclause 5.5.1.3).

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.2\]

The AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure by
sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.

The AMF shall in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message either:

a\) include one or more of the following parameters: 5G-GUTI, TAI list,
allowed NSSAI that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), LADN information,
service area list, MICO indication, NITZ information, configured NSSAI
that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), rejected NSSAI, network slicing
subscription change indication, operator-defined access category
definitions, SMS indication, service gap time value, \"CAG information
list\", UE radio capability ID, 5GS registration result, UE radio
capability ID deletion indication or truncated 5G-S-TMSI configuration;

b\) include the Configuration update indication IE with the Registration
requested bit set to \"registration requested\"; or

c\) include a combination of both a) and b).

If an acknowledgement from the UE is requested, the AMF shall indicate
\"acknowledgement requested\" in the Acknowledgement bit of the
Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message and shall start timer T3555. Acknowledgement shall be requested
for all parameters except when only NITZ is included.

...

If the AMF includes a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the AMF shall indicate
\"registration requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the
Configuration update indication IE.

...

If the UE is not in NB-N1 mode and the UE supports RACS, the AMF may
include either a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE radio capability ID
deletion indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.3\]

Upon receiving the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall
stop timer T3346 if running and use the contents to update appropriate
information stored within the UE.

If \"acknowledgement requested\" is indicated in the Acknowledgement bit
of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE
message.

...

If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message indicates \"registration
requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration
update indication IE and:

...

d\) a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
\"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\" is
included, and:

1\) the UE is not in NB-N1 mode;

2\) a new allowed NSSAI, a new configured NSSAI or a Network slicing
subscription change indication is not included; and

3\) the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM
capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message,

the UE shall, after the completion of the generic UE configuration
update procedure, start a registration procedure for mobility and
registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.

...

If the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS
supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message and the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message includes:

a\) a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
\"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\", the UE
shall delete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated
with the RPLMN or RSNPN stored at the UE; and

b\) a UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall store the UE radio
capability ID as specified in annex C

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS
supported\" in the 5GMM Capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message and the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message includes:

a\) a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
\"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\", the UE
shall delete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated
with the RPLMN or RSNPN stored at the UE, then the UE shall, after the
completion of the ongoing registration procedure, initiate a
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update as
specified in subclause 5.5.1.3.2 over the existing N1 NAS signalling
connection; and

b\) a UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall store the UE radio
capability ID as specified in annex C.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.16\]

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to
represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the
UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is applicable to neither
NB-N1 mode nor non-3GPP access.

If the UE supports RACS:

a\) the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
\"RACS supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message;

c\) if the radio configuration at the UE changes (for instance because
the UE has disabled a specific radio capability) then:

1\) if the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE
radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update. The UE shall include the
applicable UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE of
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and shall include the 5GS update type
IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NG-RAN-RCU bit set to
\"UE radio capability update needed\". If both a network-assigned UE
radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
are applicable, the UE shall include the network-assigned UE radio
capability ID in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message; and

2\) if the UE does not have an applicable UE radio capability ID for the
new UE radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and include the
5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the
NG-RAN-RCU bit set to \"UE radio capability update needed\";

NOTE: Performing the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update and including the 5GS update type IE in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NG-RAN-RCU bit set to \"UE radio
capability update needed\" without a UE radio capability ID included in
the REGISTRATION REQUEST message can trigger the network to assign a new
UE radio capability ID to the UE.

...

If the network supports RACS:

a\) the network may assign a network-assigned UE radio capability ID to
a UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message;

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

m\) when the UE needs to indicate PDU session status to the network
after performing a local release of PDU session(s) as specified in
subclauses 6.4.1.5 and 6.4.3.5;

n\) when the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode changes the radio capability for
NG-RAN or E-UTRAN;

...

For case n), the UE shall include the 5GS update type IE in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the NG-RAN-RCU bit set to \" UE radio
capability update needed\". Additionally, if the UE is not in NB-N1
mode, the UE supports RACS and the UE has an applicable UE radio
capability ID for the new UE radio configuration in the serving PLMN or
SNPN, the UE shall include the applicable UE radio capability ID in the
UE radio capability ID of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

...

If the UE is not in NB-N1 mode and the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS
supported\" in the 5GMM Capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message, the AMF may include either a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE
radio capability ID deletion indication IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message. If the UE radio capability ID IE or the UE radio capability ID
deletion indication IE is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message,
the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state
5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.401 \[10\]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to
represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the
UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is not applicable to NB-S1
mode.

If the UE supports RACS:

\- the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
\"RACS supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST
and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST messages;

\- if the UE performs an attach procedure and the UE has an applicable
UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the
selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID
availability IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message and set the IE to \"UE
radio capability ID available\";

\- if the UE performs a tracking area updating procedure and the UE has
an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio
configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio
capability ID availability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message and set the IE to \"UE radio capability ID available\";

\- If the UE is requested to provide its UE radio capability ID by the
network during a security mode control procedure, the UE shall include
its UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE of the
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message. If both a network-assigned UE radio
capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID are
applicable, the UE shall include the network-assigned UE radio
capability ID in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message;

\- if the radio configuration at the UE changes (for instance because
the UE has disabled a specific radio capability) then:

a\) if the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE
radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a tracking area updating
procedure, include a UE radio capability information update needed IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and include a UE radio
capability ID availability IE set to \"UE radio capability ID
available\" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If both a
network-assigned UE radio capability ID and a manufacturer-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID are applicable, the UE shall include the
network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message; and

b\) if the UE does not have an applicable UE radio capability ID for the
new UE radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a tracking area
updating procedure and shall include a UE radio capability information
update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message;

NOTE: Performing the tracking area updating procedure with the UE radio
capability information update needed IE included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message and without the UE radio capability ID
availability IE set to \"UE radio capability ID available\" in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in b) above can
trigger the network to assign a new UE radio capability ID to the UE.

....

\[TS 24.301, clause 5.5.3.3.2\]

The UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2, in state
EMM-REGISTERED, shall initiate the combined tracking area updating
procedure:

...

zf) in WB-S1 mode, when the applicable UE radio capability ID for the
current UE radio configuration changes due to a reselection to a new
PLMN or a revocation of the network-assigned UE radio capability IDs by
the serving PLMN; or

...

For cases n, zc, ze and zf, the UE shall include a UE radio capability
information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

##### 9.1.10.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-59 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.3, 5.4.7.2.2, 5.5.1.2.2, 5.5.1.2.4
and TS 23.502, clause 4.2.9.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16
requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.3\]

If the UE receives a new allowed NSSAI for the associated access type in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new
allowed NSSAI as valid for the associated access type, store the allowed
NSSAI for the associated access type as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2
and consider the old allowed NSSAI for the associated access type as
invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old Allowed NSSAI as valid
for the associated access type.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.7.2.2\]

When the upper layers provide an EAP-response message associated with
the HPLMN S-NSSAI, the UE shall create a NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC
AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message.

The UE shall set the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC
AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the EAP-response message.

The UE shall set the S-NSSAI IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC
AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the HPLMN S-NSSAI associated with the
EAP-response message.

The UE shall send the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE
message. Apart from this action, the network slice-specific
authentication and authorization procedure is transparent to the 5GMM
layer of the UE.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by
sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, starting timer T3510.
If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3502. If
timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.

...

If the UE supports network slice-specific authentication and
authorization, the UE shall set the NSSAA bit to \"network
slice-specific authentication and authorization supported\" in the 5GMM
capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the UE indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization, and if the Requested NSSAI IE includes
one or more S-NSSAIs subject to network slice-specific authentication
and authorization, the AMF shall in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
include:

a\) the allowed NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s) or the mapped
S-NSSAI(s), if any:

1\) which are not subject to network slice-specific authentication and
authorization and are allowed by the AMF; or

2\) for which the network slice-specific authentication and
authorization has been successfully performed;

b\) optionally, the rejected NSSAI;

c\) pending NSSAI containing one or more S-NSSAIs for which network
slice-specific authentication and authorization will be performed or is
ongoing, and one or more S-NSSAIs from the pending NSSAI which the AMF
provided to the UE during the previous registration procedure for which
network slice-specific authentication and authorization will be
performed or is ongoing, if any; and

d\) the \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator in the 5GS registration
result IE set to indicate that the network slice-specific authentication
and authorization procedure will be performed by the network, if the
allowed NSSAI is not included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization, and if:

a\) the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or none of the S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message are allowed;

b\) all subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default are subject to network
slice-specific authentication and authorization; and

c\) the network slice-specific authentication and authorization
procedure has not been successfully performed for any of the subscribed
S-NSSAIs marked as default,

the AMF shall in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message include:

a\) the \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator in the 5GS registration
result IE to indicate that the network slice-specific authentication and
authorization procedure will be performed by the network;

b\) pending NSSAI containing one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default for which network slice-specific authentication and
authorization will be performed or is ongoing and one or more S-NSSAIs
from the pending NSSAI which the AMF provided to the UE during the
previous registration procedure for which network slice-specific
authentication and authorization will be performed or is ongoing (if
any); and

c\) optionally, the rejected NSSAI.

If the UE indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization, and if:

a\) the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or none of the S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message are allowed; and

b\) one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default are not subject to
network slice-specific authentication and authorization or the network
slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure has been
successfully performed for one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default;

the AMF shall in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message include:

a\) pending NSSAI containing one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default for which network slice-specific authentication and
authorization will be performed or is ongoing (if any) and one or more
S-NSSAIs from the pending NSSAI which the AMF provided to the UE during
the previous registration procedure for which network slice-specific
authentication and authorization will be performed or is ongoing (if
any);

b\) allowed NSSAI containing S-NSSAI(s) for the current PLMN each of
which corresponds to a subscribed S-NSSAI marked as default which are
not subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization
or for which the network slice-specific authentication and authorization
has been successfully performed;

c\) allowed NSSAI containing one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default, as the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI in roaming
scenarios, which are not subject to network slice-specific
authentication and authorization or for which the network slice-specific
authentication and authorization has been successfully performed; and

d\) optionally, the rejected NSSAI.

When the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message includes a pending NSSAI, the
pending NSSAI shall contain all S-NSSAIs for which network
slice-specific authentication and authorization will be performed or is
ongoing from the requested NSSAI of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
that was received over the 3GPP access, non-3GPP access, or both the
3GPP access and non-3GPP access

...

The UE that has indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization receiving the pending NSSAI in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message shall store the S-NSSAI(s) in the pending
NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2. If the registration area
contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs,
the UE shall store the received pending NSSAI for each of the equivalent
PLMNs as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2. If the pending NSSAI is not
included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the \"NSSAA to be
performed\" indicator is not set to \"Network slice-specific
authentication and authorization is to be performed\" in the 5GS
registration result IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, then the UE
shall delete the pending NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN, if
existing, as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\[TS 23.502 clause 4.2.9.2\]

19a. \[Conditional\] If a new Allowed NSSAI (i.e. including any new
S-NSSAIs in a Requested NSSAI for which the NSSAA procedure succeeded
and/or excluding any S-NSSAI(s) in the existing Allowed NSSAI for the UE
for which the procedure has failed) and/or new Rejected S-NSSAIs (i.e.
including any S-NSSAI(s) in the existing Allowed NSSAI for the UE for
which the procedure has failed, or any new requested S-NSSAI(s) for
which the NSSAA procedure failed) need to be delivered to the UE, or if
the AMF re-allocation is required, the AMF initiates the UE
Configuration Update procedure, for each Access Type, as described in
clause 4.2.4.2. If the Network Slice-Specific Re-Authentication and
Re-Authorization fails and there are PDU session(s) established that are
associated with the S-NSSAI for which the NSSAA procedure failed, the
AMF shall initiate the PDU Session Release procedure as specified in
clause 4.3.4 to release the PDU sessions with the appropriate cause
value.

##### 9.1.10.2.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-60 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-155 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED state }

**ensure that** {

**when** { SS sends NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message }

**then** { the UE shall ignore the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION
COMMAND message and proceed with the de-registration procedure }

}

##### 9.1.10.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-60 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.4.7.2.4. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.7.2.4\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) Transmission failure of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION
COMPLETE message with TAI change from lower layers

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the network slice-specific
authentication and authorization procedure shall be aborted and a
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
indicating \"mobility registration updating\" in the 5GS registration
type IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message shall be initiated.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the
network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure.

b\) Transmission failure of NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION
COMPLETE message indication without TAI change from lower layers

It is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure
that triggered the network slice-specific authentication and
authorization procedure.

c\) Network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure
and de-registration procedure collision

If the UE receives NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message
after sending a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message and the access type
included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is the same as the access
in which the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message is
received, then the UE shall ignore the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC
AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the de-registration
procedure. Otherwise, the UE shall proceed with both procedures.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains the Network slicing
indication IE with the Network slicing subscription change indication
set to \"Network slicing subscription changed\", or contains a
configured NSSAI IE with a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN and
optionally the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the configured NSSAI for the
current PLMN, the UE shall return a REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the
AMF to acknowledge the successful update of the network slicing
information.

...

The AMF shall include the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN and shall
include the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI contained in the
requested NSSAI from the UE if available, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message if the UE included the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message and the AMF allows one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested
NSSAI.

The AMF may also include rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message. Rejected NSSAI contains S-NSSAI(s) which was included in the
requested NSSAI but rejected by the network associated with rejection
cause(s) with the following restrictions:

a\) rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN shall not include an
S-NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN which is associated to multiple
mapped S-NSSAIs and some of these mapped S-NSSAIs are not allowed; and

b\) rejected NSSAI for the current registration area shall not include
an S-NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN which is associated to multiple
mapped S-NSSAIs and some of these mapped S-NSSAIs are not allowed.

NOTE 6: The UE can avoid requesting an S-NSSAI associated with a mapped
S-NSSAI, which was included in the previous requested NSSAI but neither
in the allowed NSSAI nor in the rejected NSSAI in the consequent
registration procedures.

If the UE indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization, and if the Requested NSSAI IE includes
one or more S-NSSAIs subject to network slice-specific authentication
and authorization, the AMF shall in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
include:

a\) the allowed NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s) or the mapped
S-NSSAI(s), if any:

1\) which are not subject to network slice-specific authentication and
authorization and are allowed by the AMF; or

2\) for which the network slice-specific authentication and
authorization has been successfully performed;

b\) optionally, the rejected NSSAI;

c\) pending NSSAI containing one or more S-NSSAIs for which network
slice-specific authentication and authorization will be performed or is
ongoing, and one or more S-NSSAIs from the pending NSSAI which the AMF
provided to the UE during the previous registration procedure for which
network slice-specific authentication and authorization will be
performed or is ongoing, if any; and

d\) the \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator in the 5GS registration
result IE set to indicate whether network slice-specific authentication
and authorization procedure will be performed by the network, if the
allowed NSSAI is not included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization, and if:

a\) the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or none of the S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message are allowed;

b\) all subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default are subject to network
slice-specific authentication and authorization;

c\) the network slice-specific authentication and authorization
procedure has not been successfully performed for any of the subscribed
S-NSSAIs marked as default; and

d\) the network slice-specific authentication and authorization
procedure has not failed or been revoked for all subscribed S-NSSAI
marked as default;

the AMF shall in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message include:

a\) the \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator in the 5GS registration
result IE to indicate whether network slice-specific authentication and
authorization procedure will be performed by the network; and

b\) pending NSSAI containing one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default for which network slice-specific authentication and
authorization will be performed or is ongoing and one or more S-NSSAIs
from the pending NSSAI which the AMF provided to the UE during the
previous registration procedure for which network slice-specific
authentication and authorization will be performed or is ongoing (if
any).

If the UE indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization, and if:

a\) the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or none of the S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message are allowed; and

b\) one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default are not subject to
network slice-specific authentication and authorization or the network
slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure has been
successfully performed for one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default;

the AMF shall in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message include:

a\) pending NSSAI containing one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default for which network slice-specific authentication and
authorization will be performed or is ongoing (if any) and one or more
S-NSSAIs from the pending NSSAI which the AMF provided to the UE during
the previous registration procedure for which network slice-specific
authentication and authorization will be performed or is ongoing (if
any);

b\) allowed NSSAI containing S-NSSAI(s) for the current PLMN each of
which corresponds to a subscribed S-NSSAI marked as default which are
not subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization
or for which the network slice-specific authentication and authorization
has been successfully performed; and

c\) allowed NSSAI containing one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default, as the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI in roaming
scenarios, which are not subject to network slice-specific
authentication and authorization or for which the network slice-specific
authentication and authorization has been successfully performed.

When the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message includes a pending NSSAI, the
pending NSSAI shall contain all S-NSSAIs for which network
slice-specific authentication and authorization will be performed or is
ongoing from the requested NSSAI of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message
that was received over the 3GPP access, non-3GPP access, or both the
3GPP access or non-3GPP access.

The AMF may include a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if:

a\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message did not include the requested
NSSAI;

b\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the requested NSSAI
containing an S-NSSAI that is not valid in the serving PLMN;

c\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the requested NSSAI
containing S-NSSAI(s) with incorrect mapped S-NSSAI(s); or

d\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the Network slicing
indication IE with the Default configured NSSAI indication bit set to
\"Requested NSSAI created from default configured NSSAI\".

If a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN is included in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the AMF shall also include the mapped
S-NSSAI(s) for the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN if available in
the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. In this case the AMF shall start timer
T3550 and enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in
subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data
in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF has valid ciphering key
data applicable to the UE\'s subscription and current tracking area,
then the AMF shall include the ciphering key data in the Ciphering key
data IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.

The AMF shall include the Network slicing indication IE with the Network
slicing subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing
subscription changed\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UDM has
indicated that the subscription data for network slicing has changed. In
this case the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state
5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The UE that has indicated the support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization receiving the pending NSSAI in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message shall store the S-NSSAI(s) in the pending
NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2. If the registration area
contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs,
the UE shall store the received pending NSSAI for each of the equivalent
PLMNs as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2. If the pending NSSAI is not
included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message and the \"NSSAA to be
performed\" indicator is not set to \"Network slice-specific
authentication and authorization is to be performed\" in the 5GS
registration result IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, then the UE
shall delete the pending NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN, if
existing, as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
S-NSSAI(s):

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not attempt to
use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current PLMN until switching off the UE, the
UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated,
or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as described in
subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall
not attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current registration area
until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current
registration area, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network
slice-specific authentication and authorization\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
failed or revoked NSSAA as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN over any access until
switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.2.

If the UE sets the NSSAA bit in the 5GMM capability IE to \"Network
slice-specific authentication and authorization not supported\", and:

a\) if the Requested NSSAI IE only includes the S-NSSAI(s) subject to
network slice-specific authentication and authorization and one or more
subscribed S-NSSAIs (containing one or more S-NSSAIs each of which may
be associated with a new S-NSSAI) marked as default which are not
subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization are
available, the AMF shall in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message include:

1\) the allowed NSSAI containing S-NSSAI(s) for the current PLMN each of
which corresponds to a subscribed S-NSSAI marked as default which are
not subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization;

2\) the allowed NSSAI containing the subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as
default, as the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI in roaming
scenarios, which are not subject to network slice-specific
authentication and authorization; and

3\) the rejected NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s) subject to network
slice specific authentication and authorization with the rejection cause
indicating \"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\", except
if the S-NSSAI(s) is associated to multiple mapped S-NSSAIs and some of
these mapped S-NSSAIs are not subject to NSSAA; or

b\) if the Requested NSSAI IE includes one or more S-NSSAIs subject to
network slice-specific authentication and authorization, the AMF shall
in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message include:

1\) the allowed NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s) or the mapped S-NSSAI(s)
which are not subject to network slice-specific authentication and
authorization; and

2\) the rejected NSSAI containing:

i\) the S-NSSAI(s) subject to network slice specific authentication and
authorization with the rejection cause indicating \"S-NSSAI not
available in the current PLMN or SNPN\", except if the S-NSSAI is
associated to multiple mapped S-NSSAIs and some of these mapped S-NSSAIs
are not subject to NSSAA; and

ii\) the S-NSSAI(s) which was included in the requested NSSAI but
rejected by the network associated with the rejection cause indicating
\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\" or the rejection
cause indicating \"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration
area\", if any.

If the UE does not indicate support for network slice-specific
authentication and authorization, and if:

a\) the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message; or

b\) none of the S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message are allowed;

and one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs (containing one or more S-NSSAIs
each of which may be associated with a new S-NSSAI) marked as default
which are not subject to network slice-specific authentication and
authorization are available, the AMF shall:

a\) put the allowed S-NSSAI(s) for the current PLMN each of which
corresponds to a subscribed S-NSSAI marked as default and not subject to
network slice-specific authentication and authorization in the allowed
NSSAI of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message;

b\) put the subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default and not subject to
network slice-specific authentication and authorization, as the mapped
S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI in roaming scenarios, in the allowed
NSSAI of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message; and

c\) determine a registration area such that all S-NSSAIs of the allowed
NSSAI are available in the registration area.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains the Network slicing
indication IE with the Network slicing subscription change indication
set to \"Network slicing subscription changed\", the UE shall delete the
network slicing information for each and every PLMN except for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains the allowed NSSAI, then the
UE shall store the included allowed NSSAI together with the PLMN
identity of the registered PLMN and the registration area as specified
in subclause 4.6.2.2. If the registration area contains TAIs belonging
to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the UE shall store the
received allowed NSSAI in each of allowed NSSAIs which are associated
with each of the PLMNs.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message contains a configured NSSAI IE with a
new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN and optionally the mapped
S-NSSAI(s) for the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, the UE shall
store the contents of the configured NSSAI IE as specified in
subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message:

a\) includes the \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator in the 5GS
registration result IE;

b\) includes a pending NSSAI; and

c\) does not include an allowed NSSAI,

the UE shall not initiate a:

a\) 5GSM procedure except for emergency services or high priority access
until the UE receives an allowed NSSAI; and

b\) service request procedure except for cases f) and i) in
subclause 5.6.1.1.

...

If required by operator policy, the AMF shall include the NSSAI
inclusion mode IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message (see
table 4.6.2.3.1 of subclause 4.6.2.3). Upon receipt of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message:

a\) if the message includes the NSSAI inclusion mode IE, the UE shall
operate in the NSSAI inclusion mode indicated in the NSSAI inclusion
mode IE over the current access within the current PLMN and its
equivalent PLMN(s), if any, in the current registration area; or

b\) otherwise:

1\) if the UE has NSSAI inclusion mode for the current PLMN and access
type stored in the UE, the UE shall operate in the stored NSSAI
inclusion mode;

2\) if the UE does not have NSSAI inclusion mode for the current PLMN
and the access type stored in the UE and if the UE is performing the
registration procedure over:

i\) 3GPP access, the UE shall operate in NSSAI inclusion mode D in the
current PLMN and the current access type;

ii\) untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE shall operate in NSSAI inclusion
mode B in the current PLMN and the current access type; or

iii\) trusted non-3GPP access, the UE shall operate in NSSAI inclusion
mode D in the current PLMN and the current access type; or

3\) if the 5G-RG does not have NSSAI inclusion mode for the current PLMN
and wireline access stored in the 5G-RG, and the 5G-RG is performing the
registration procedure over wireline access, the 5G-RG shall operate in
NSSAI inclusion mode B in the current PLMN and the current access type.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request is rejected because:

a\) all the S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI are either
rejected for the current PLMN, rejected for the current registration
area, or rejected for the failed or revoked NSSAAs; and

b\) the UE set the NSSAA bit in the 5GMM capability IE to:

1\) \"Network slice-specific authentication and authorization
supported\" and:

i\) there are no subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default;

ii\) all subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default are not allowed; or

iii\) network slice-specific authentication and authorization has failed
or been revoked for all subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default and based
on network local policy, the network decides not to initiate the network
slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization procedures for any
subscribed S-NSSAI marked as default requested by the UE; or

2\) \"Network slice-specific authentication and authorization not
supported\"; and

i\) there are no subscribed S-NSSAIs which are marked as default; or

ii\) all subscribed S-NSSAIs marked as default are either not allowed or
are subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization;

the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to \#62 \"No network slices
available\". If the UE had included requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message, then the network shall include the rejected S-NSSAI(s)
in the Rejected NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION REJECT message. Otherwise,
the network may include the rejected NSSAI.

...

\#62 (No network slices available).

The UE shall abort the initial registration procedure, set the 5GS
update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE or 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.
Additionally, the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REJECT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
S-NSSAI(s):

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN or SNPN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current PLMN or SNPN until
switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, an entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed as described in
subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as described in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall
not attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current registration area
until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current
registration area, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network
slice-specific authentication and authorization\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
failed or revoked NSSAA as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN over any access until
switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.2.

and TS 23.502, clause 4.2.9.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16
requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.3\]

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the
rejected S-NSSAI(s):

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not attempt to
use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current PLMN until switching off the UE, the
UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated,
or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as described in
subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall
not attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current registration area
until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current
registration area, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network
slice-specific authentication and authorization\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
failed or revoked NSSAA as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN over any access until
switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current

##### 9.1.11.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-64 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.5, 5.1.3.2.1, 5.1.3.2.2, TS
23.122 clause 4.9.3.0. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16
requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

...

\#74 (Temporarily not authorized for this SNPN).

5GMM cause \#74 is only applicable when received from a cell belonging
to an SNPN. 5GMM cause \#74 received from a cell not belonging to an
SNPN is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is
specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. The UE shall
reset the registration attempt counter and store the SNPN identity in
the \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" list for the specific access type
for which the message was received. The UE shall enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform an SNPN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]. If the message has been successfully integrity
checked by the NAS, the UE shall set the SNPN-specific attempt counter
for 3GPP access and the SNPN-specific attempt counter for non-3GPP
access for the current SNPN to the UE implementation-specific maximum
value.

If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and
the UE also supports the registration procedure over the other access to
the same SNPN, the UE shall in addition handle 5GMM parameters and 5GMM
state for this access, as described for this 5GMM cause value.

NOTE 4: When 5GMM cause \#74 is received over 3GPP access, the term
\"other access\" in \"the UE also supports the registration procedure
over the other access to the same SNPN\" is used to express access to
SNPN services via a PLMN.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.1.3.5\]

The substate 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH is chosen in the UE, if the
UE is searching for PLMNs or SNPNs. This substate is left either when a
cell has been selected (the new substate is NORMAL-SERVICE or
LIMITED-SERVICE) or when it has been concluded that no cell is available
at the moment (the new substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE).

This substate is not applicable to non-3GPP access.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.2\]

In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour, the 5GS update (5U)
status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.

If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), the 5GS update status is stored in a non-volatile
memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in the USIM,
else in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in annex C.

If the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode, the 5GS update
status for each SNPN whose SNPN identity is included in the \"list of
subscriber data\" configured in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) is
stored in the non-volatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.

The 5GS update status value is changed only after the execution of a
registration, network-initiated de-registration, 5GS based primary
authentication and key agreement, service request, paging procedure or
due to change in TAI which does not belong to the current registration
area while T3346 is running.

5U1: UPDATED

The last registration attempt was successful.

5U2: NOT UPDATED

The last registration attempt failed procedurally, e.g. no response or
reject message was received from the AMF.

5U3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

The last registration, service request, or registration for mobility or
periodic registration update attempt was correctly performed, but the
answer from the AMF was negative (because of roaming or subscription
restrictions).

\[TS 23.122, clause 4.9.3.0\]

The ME is configured with a \"list of subscriber data\" containing zero
or more entries. Each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" consists
of:

...The MS shall maintain a list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" and a
list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" in the ME. Each entry of those
lists consists of an SNPN identity.

The MS shall add an SNPN to the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\",
if a message with cause value \#74 \"Temporarily not authorized for this
SNPN\" (see 3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\]) is received by the MS in response to
an LR request from the SNPN. In addition, if:

\- the message is integrity-protected; or

\- the message is not integrity-protected, and the value of the
SNPN-specific attempt counter for that SNPN is equal to the MS
implementation specific maximum value as defined in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\];

then the MS shall start an MS implementation specific timer not shorter
than 60 minutes. The MS shall remove an SNPN from the list of
\"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\", if:

a\) there is a successful LR after a subsequent manual selection of the
SNPN;

b\) the MS implementation specific timer not shorter than 60 minutes
expires;

c\) the timer T3247 expires and the value of the SNPN-specific attempt
counter for that SNPN is less than the MS implementation specific
maximum value as defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\];

d\) the MS is switched off; or

e\) an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity
of the SNPN is updated or the USIM is removed if:

\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using
EAP-AKA\'; or

\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;

was performed in the selected SNPN.

If an SNPN is removed from the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\"
list, the MS shall stop the MS implementation specific timer not shorter
than 60 minutes, if running.

##### 9.1.11.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-65 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.5, 5.1.3.2.1, 5.1.3.2.2, TS
23.122 clause 4.9.3.0. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16
requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

...

\#75 (Permanently not authorized for this SNPN).

5GMM cause \#75 is only applicable when received from a cell belonging
to an SNPN with a globally-unique SNPN identity. 5GMM cause \#75
received from a cell not belonging to an SNPN or a cell belonging to an
SNPN with a non-globally-unique SNPN identity is considered as an
abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. The UE shall
reset the registration attempt counter and store the SNPN identity in
the \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" list for the specific access type
for which the message was received and, if the UE supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, the selected entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. If
the registration request is not for onboarding services in SNPN, the UE
shall enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform an SNPN
selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]. If the registration request
is for onboarding services in SNPN, the UE shall enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform an SNPN selection for
onboarding services according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]. If the message
has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS, the UE shall set the
SNPN-specific attempt counter for 3GPP access and the SNPN-specific
attempt counter for non-3GPP access for the current SNPN to the UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and
the UE also supports the registration procedure over the other access to
the same SNPN, the UE shall in addition handle 5GMM parameters and 5GMM
state for this access, as described for this 5GMM cause value.

NOTE 6: When 5GMM cause \#75 is received over 3GPP access, the term
\"other access\" in \"the UE also supports the registration procedure
over the other access to the same SNPN\" is used to express access to
SNPN services via a PLMN.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.1.3.5\]

The substate 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH is chosen in the UE, if the
UE is searching for PLMNs or SNPNs. This substate is left either when a
cell has been selected (the new substate is NORMAL-SERVICE or
LIMITED-SERVICE) or when it has been concluded that no cell is available
at the moment (the new substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE).

This substate is not applicable to non-3GPP access.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.2\]

In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour, the 5GS update (5U)
status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.

If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), the 5GS update status is stored in a non-volatile
memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in the USIM,
else in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in annex C.

If the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode, the 5GS update
status for each SNPN whose SNPN identity is included in the \"list of
subscriber data\" configured in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) is
stored in the non-volatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.

The 5GS update status value is changed only after the execution of a
registration, network-initiated de-registration, 5GS based primary
authentication and key agreement, service request, paging procedure or
due to change in TAI which does not belong to the current registration
area while T3346 is running.

5U1: UPDATED

The last registration attempt was successful.

5U2: NOT UPDATED

The last registration attempt failed procedurally, e.g. no response or
reject message was received from the AMF.

5U3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

The last registration, service request, or registration for mobility or
periodic registration update attempt was correctly performed, but the
answer from the AMF was negative (because of roaming or subscription
restrictions).

\[TS 23.122, clause 4.9.3.0\]

The ME is configured with a \"list of subscriber data\" containing zero
or more entries. Each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" consists
of:

... The MS shall add an SNPN to the list of \"permanently forbidden
SNPNs\" which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials
from a credentials holder, associated with the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, if a
message with cause value \#75 \"Permanently not authorized for this
SNPN\" (see 3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\]) is received by the MS in response to
an LR request from the SNPN.

The MS shall remove an SNPN from the list of \"permanently forbidden
SNPNs\" which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials
from a credentials holder, associated with the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, if:

a\) there is a successful LR after a subsequent manual selection of the
SNPN;

b\) the MS is configured to use timer T3245 and timer T3245 expires;

c\) the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the timer T3247 expires
and the value of the SNPN-specific attempt counter for that SNPN is less
than the MS implementation specific maximum value as defined in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\] ;

d\) an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the subscribed SNPN
identity identifying the SNPN is updated or the USIM is removed if:

\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using
EAP-AKA\'; or

\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;

was performed in the selected SNPN; or

e\) the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is updated or
USIM is removed for the selected PLMN subscription.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.8\]

Upon receiving an EAP-success message, if the ME has not generated a
partial native 5G NAS security context as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.2.3, the ME shall:

a\) generate the K~AUSF~ from the EMSK, the K~SEAF~ from the K~AUSF~,
and the K~AMF~ from the ABBA that was received with the EAP-success
message, and the K~SEAF~ as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\];

b\) create a partial native 5G NAS security context identified by the
ngKSI value in the volatile memory of the ME; and

c\) store the K~AMF~ in the created partial native 5G NAS security
context.

The UE shall consider the procedure complete.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.2.2.11\]

Upon receiving an EAP-failure message, the UE shall delete the partial
native 5G NAS security context if any was created as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.2.3.

The UE shall consider the procedure complete.

If the EAP-failure message is received in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT
message:

1\) if the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message has been successfully integrity
checked by the NAS:

\- The UE shall set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete
the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and ngKSI;

In case of PLMN, the USIM shall be considered invalid until switching
off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed;

In case of SNPN, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the
SNPN identity of the current SNPN shall be considered invalid until the
UE is switched off or the entry is updated. Additionally, the UE shall
consider the USIM as invalid for the current SNPN until switching off or
the UICC containing the USIM is removed;

\- The UE shall set:

i\) the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\"
events, the counter for \"USIM considered invalid for 5GS services over
non-3GPP access\" events, and the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered
invalid for non-GPRS services\" events if maintained by the UE, in case
of PLMN; or

ii\) the counter for \"the entry for the current SNPN considered invalid
for 3GPP access\" events and the counter for \"the entry for the current
SNPN considered invalid for non-3GPP access\" events in case of SNPN;

to UE implementation-specific maximum value;

\[TS 24.501, clause 9.12.1\]

The serving network name (SNN) is used:

\- in the Network name field of the AT\_KDF\_INPUT attribute defined in
*IETF RFC 5448* \[40\];

\- in K~AUSF~ derivation function as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]
annex A; and

\- in RES\* and XRES\* derivation function as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\] annex A.

SNN shall contain a UTF-8 string without terminating null characters.

SNN is of maximum length of 1020 octets.

SNN consists of SNN-service-code and SNN-network-identifier, delimited
by a colon.

SNN-network-identifier identifies the serving PLMN or the serving SNPN.

MCC and MNC in the SNN-PLMN-ID are MCC and MNC of the serving PLMN. If
the MNC of the serving PLMN has two digits, then a zero is added at the
beginning.

MCC and MNC in the SNN-SNPN-ID are MCC and MNC of the serving SNPN. If
the MNC of the serving SNPN has two digits, then a zero is added at the
beginning.

SNN-NID contains an NID in hexadecimal digits.

ABNF syntax of SNN is specified in table 9.12.1.1

NOTE: SNN-service-code allows for distinguishing of ANID specified in
3GPP TS 24.302 \[16\] and SNN as either of SNN or ANID can be carried in
the AT\_KDF\_INPUT attribute.

EXAMPLE 1: In case of a PLMN, if PLMN ID contains MCC = 234 and MNC =
15, SNN is 5G:mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org.

EXAMPLE 2: In case of an SNPN, if SNPN ID contains a PLMN ID of MCC =
234 and MNC = 15 and an NID of 123456ABCDEH, SNN is

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer
T3346.

...\#12 (Tracking area not allowed).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally,
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter.

If:

1\) the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode, the UE shall
store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\" and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is
not integrity protected, the UE shall memorize the current TAI was
stored in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\" for non-integrity protected NAS reject message;
or

2\) the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode, the UE shall
store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\" for the current SNPN and, if the UE
supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder,
the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected
PLMN subscription, and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. If the REGISTRATION REJECT is not
integrity protected, the UE shall memorize the current TAI was stored in
the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service\" for the current SNPN and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, for
non-integrity protected NAS reject message.

If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall handle the EMM parameters EMM
state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI
list, eKSI and attach attempt counter as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the case when the EPS attach request procedure
is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

##### 9.1.11.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-68 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.5 and TS 23.122 clause 4.9.3.1.3
and 4.9.3.1.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer
T3346.

...\#6 (Illegal ME).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI.

In case of PLMN, the UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for 5GS
services until switching off, the UICC containing the USIM is removed or
the timer T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.19a.1;

In case of SNPN, if the UE is not performing initial registration for
onboarding services in SNPN and the UE does not support access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, the UE shall consider
the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of
the current SNPN as invalid until the UE is switched off, the entry is
updated or the timer T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.19a.2. In
case of SNPN, if the UE is not performing initial registration for
onboarding services in SNPN and the UE supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, the UE shall consider the
selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" as invalid for 3GPP
access until the UE is switched off, the entry is updated or the timer
T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.19a.2. Additionally, if EAP
based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using EAP-AKA\'
or 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure was
performed in the current SNPN, the UE shall consider the USIM as invalid
for the current SNPN until switching off, the UICC containing the USIM
is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.19a.2.

If the UE is not performing initial registration for onboarding services
in SNPN and the UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs (if any)
and enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-SUPI. If the message has been
successfully integrity checked by the NAS, then the UE shall:

1\) set the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS
services\" events and the counter for \"USIM considered invalid for 5GS
services over non-3GPP access\" events in case of PLMN if the UE
maintains these counters; or

2\) set the counter for \"the entry for the current SNPN considered
invalid for 3GPP access\" events and the counter for \"the entry for the
current SNPN considered invalid for non-3GPP access\" events in case of
SNPN if the UE maintains these counters;

to a UE implementation-specific maximum value.

3\) delete the 5GMM parameters stored in non-volatile memory of the ME
as specified in annex C.

If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall handle the EMM parameters EMM
state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list
and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the case when the EPS
attach request procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same
value. The USIM shall be considered as invalid also for non-EPS services
until switching off, the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the
timer T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.7a in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]. If the message has been successfully integrity
checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM
considered invalid for non-GPRS services\", then the UE shall set this
counter to a UE implementation-specific maximum value.

If the UE is performing initial registration for onboarding services in
SNPN, the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter, store the
SNPN identity in the \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" list for onboarding
services, enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, and perform an SNPN
selection or an SNPN selection for onboarding services according to
3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]. If the message has been successfully integrity
checked by the NAS, the UE shall set the SNPN-specific attempt counter
for the current SNPN to the UE implementation-specific maximum value.

If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and
the UE also supports the registration procedure over the other access,
the UE shall in addition handle 5GMM parameters and 5GMM state for this
access, as described for this 5GMM cause value.\[TS 23.122, clause
4.9.3.1.3\]

When the MS needs to access an SNPN for onboarding services in SNPN, the
MS shall select an SNPN indicating that onboarding is allowed and, if
the onboarding SNPN selection information is pre-configured, also
matching the onboarding SNPN selection information. If more than one
such SNPNs are available, how the MS selects one of those SNPNs is MS
implementation specific. The MS shall not select an SNPN not indicating
that onboarding is allowed or not matching the onboarding SNPN selection
information, if pre-configured, for onboarding services in SNPN.

The MS shall limit its search for the SNPN to the NG-RAN access
technology.

Once the MS selects the SNPN, the MS shall attempt initial registration
for onboarding services in SNPN on the selected SNPN using the NG-RAN
access technology and the default UE credentials for primary
authentication.

If successful registration is achieved, the MS may indicate to upper
layers the selected SNPN. How this indication is displayed by upper
layers is implementation specific.

If successful registration is not achieved and one or more other SNPNs
indicating that onboarding is allowed and matching the onboarding SNPN
selection information, if pre-configured, are available, the MS can
select such other SNPN and attempt initial registration for onboarding
services in SNPN on the selected SNPN using the NG-RAN access technology
and the default UE credentials for primary authentication, or the MS can
perform SNPN selection not for onboarding services in SNPN as specified
in clause 4.9.3.1.1 or clause 4.9.3.1.2 depending on its SNPN selection
mode.

If:

\- registration cannot be achieved because no SNPNs indicating that
onboarding is allowed and matching the onboarding SNPN selection
information, if pre-configured, are available; or

\- there were one or more SNPNs indicating that onboarding is allowed
and matching the onboarding SNPN selection information, if
pre-configured, but an LR failure made registration on all those SNPNs
unsuccessful;

the MS can indicate no onboarding services to upper layers, enter
limited service state and wait until a new SNPN indicating that
onboarding is allowed and matching the onboarding SNPN selection
information, if pre-configured, is available and then repeat the
procedure, or the MS can perform SNPN selection not for onboarding
services in SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3.1.1 or clause 4.9.3.1.2
depending on its SNPN selection mode.

\[TS 23.122, clause 4.9.3.1.4\]

The MS shall indicate to upper layers one or more SNPNs, which are
available and indicate that onboarding is allowed.

These include SNPNs in the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" for
onboarding services and the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" for
onboarding services. The MS may indicate to the user whether the
available SNPNs are present in the list of \"temporarily forbidden
SNPNs\" or the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\".

The MS shall limit its search for the SNPN to the NG-RAN access
technology.

For each SNPN indicated to upper layers, the MS shall indicate to the
upper layers along with the SNPN identity:

a\) whether the SNPN matches the onboarding SNPN selection information,
if pre-configured; and

b\) the human-readable network name, if the system information broadcast
includes the human-readable network name for the SNPN.

\[TS 23.122 clause 4.9.3.0\]

The ME is configured with a \"list of subscriber data\" containing zero
or more entries. Each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" consists
of:

...

The MS shall add an SNPN to the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\"
(for onboarding services, if the MS is registered for onboarding
services in SNPN or performing initial registration for onboarding
services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, associated with the selected
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription, if a message with cause value \#75 \"Permanently not
authorized for this SNPN\", \#3 \"Illegal UE\" (applicable in an
onboarding SNPN only), \#6 \"Illegal ME\" (applicable in an onboarding
SNPN only), or \#7 \"5GS services not allowed\" (applicable in an
onboarding SNPN only) (see 3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\]) is received by the MS
in response to an LR request from the SNPN.

The MS shall remove an SNPN from the list of \"permanently forbidden
SNPNs\" (for onboarding services, if the MS is registered for onboarding
services in SNPN or performing initial registration for onboarding
services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, associated with the selected
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription, if:

a\) there is a successful LR after a subsequent manual selection of the
SNPN;

b\) the MS is configured to use timer T3245 and timer T3245 expires;

c\) the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the timer T3247 expires
and the value of the SNPN-specific attempt counter for that SNPN is less
than the MS implementation specific maximum value as defined in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\];

d\) an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the subscribed SNPN
identity identifying the SNPN is updated or the USIM is removed if:

\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using
EAP-AKA\'; or

\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;

was performed in the selected SNPN; or

e\) the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is updated or
USIM is removed for the selected PLMN subscription.

##### (1) {#section-179 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED state for onboarding
service and SS initiates a 5G AKA based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE receives an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message }

**then** { UE shall store the SNPN identity in the \"permanently
forbidden SNPNs\" list for onboarding services, enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, and perform SNPN selection }

}

##### (2) {#section-180 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED state using credentials
from a credentials holder and SS initiates an 5G AKA based primary
authentication and key agreement procedure }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE receives an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message }

**then** { the UE shall consider the entry of the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" as invalid for 3GPP access until the UE is
switched off or the entry is updated, and the USIM is considered invalid
until switching off the UE }

9.1.11.7.2 Conformance requirements

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.4.1.3.5 and clause 5.5.1.2.2, TS23.122
clauses 4.9.3.0. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.1.3.5\]

If the authentication response (RES) returned by the UE is not valid,
the network response depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in
the initial NAS message, that is:

> \- if the 5G-GUTI was used; or
>
> \- if the SUCI was used.

If the 5G-GUTI was used, the network should initiate an identification
procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the 5G AKA based
primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received
SUCI.

If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in
a restarted 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure, or the network decides not to initiate the identification
procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful 5G AKA
based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the network
should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message,

> 1\) if the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message has been successfully
> integrity checked by the NAS:
>
> the UE shall set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete
> the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and ngKSI.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

...

If the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder and the UE is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN or a subscribed
SNPN, the UE shall set the SSNPNSI bit to \"SOR-SNPN-SI supported\" in
the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

\[TS 23.122 clause 4.9.3.0\]

The ME is configured with a \"list of subscriber data\" containing zero
or more entries. Each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" consists
of:

...

The MS shall add an SNPN to the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\"
(for onboarding services, if the MS is registered for onboarding
services in SNPN or performing initial registration for onboarding
services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, associated with the selected
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription, if a message with cause value \#75 \"Permanently not
authorized for this SNPN\", \#3 \"Illegal UE\" (applicable in an
onboarding SNPN only), \#6 \"Illegal ME\" (applicable in an onboarding
SNPN only), or \#7 \"5GS services not allowed\" (applicable in an
onboarding SNPN only) (see 3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\]) is received by the MS
in response to an LR request from the SNPN.

The MS shall remove an SNPN from the list of \"permanently forbidden
SNPNs\" (for onboarding services, if the MS is registered for onboarding
services in SNPN or performing initial registration for onboarding
services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, associated with the selected
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription, if:

a\) there is a successful LR after a subsequent manual selection of the
SNPN;

b\) the MS is configured to use timer T3245 and timer T3245 expires;

c\) the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the timer T3247 expires
and the value of the SNPN-specific attempt counter for that SNPN is less
than the MS implementation specific maximum value as defined in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\];

d\) an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the subscribed SNPN
identity identifying the SNPN is updated or the USIM is removed if:

\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using
EAP-AKA\'; or

\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;

was performed in the selected SNPN; or

e\) the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is updated or
USIM is removed for the selected PLMN subscription.

##### 9.1.12.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-70 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.2, 5.5.1.2.4 and 10.2. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by
sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, starting timer T3510.
If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3502. If
timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.

...

The UE shall set the ER-NSSAI bit to \"Extended rejected NSSAI
supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI and the AMF determines that
maximum number of UEs reached for one or more S-NSSAI(s) in the
requested NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.5**, the AMF shall
include the rejected NSSAI** containing one or more S-NSSAIs with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\" in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE **in the** REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. In addition, the AMF may include a back-off timer value
for each S-NSSAI with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to
maximum number of UEs reached\" included in the Extended rejected NSSAI
IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. To avoid that large numbers of
UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network should select
the value for the backoff timer for each S-NSSAI for the informed UEs so
that timeouts are not synchronised.

...

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
S-NSSAI(s):

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN or SNPN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current PLMN or SNPN until
switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall
not attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current registration area
until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current
registration area, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network
slice-specific authentication and authorization\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
failed or revoked NSSAA as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over any access
until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the
current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or
deleted as described in subclause 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\"

Unless the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI is zero,
the UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
maximum number of UEs reached as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and
shall not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over
the current access until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the
USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the
SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s)
are removed as described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

NOTE 15: If the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI in
the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is zero as
specified in subclause 10.5.7.4a of TS 24.008, the UE does not consider
the S-NSSAI as the rejected S-NSSAI.

If there is one or more S-NSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\", then for each S-NSSAI, the UE shall behave as follows:

a\) stop the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI, if running;

b\) start the timer T3526 with:

1\) the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI, if a
back-off timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI that is neither
zero nor deactivated; or

2\) an implementation specific back-off timer value, if no back-off
timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI; and

c\) remove the S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of
UEs reached when the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI expires.

stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI and the AMF determines that
maximum number of UEs reached for one or more S-NSSAI(s) in the
requested NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.5**, the AMF shall
include the rejected NSSAI** containing one or more S-NSSAIs with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\" in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE **in the** REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. In addition, the AMF may include a back-off timer value
for each S-NSSAI with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to
maximum number of UEs reached\" included in the Extended rejected NSSAI
IE of the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. To avoid that large numbers of
UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network should select
the value for the backoff timer for each S-NSSAI for the informed UEs so
that timeouts are not synchronised.

...

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
S-NSSAI(s):

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN or SNPN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current PLMN or SNPN until
switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall
not attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current registration area
until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current
registration area, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network
slice-specific authentication and authorization\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
failed or revoked NSSAA as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over any access
until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the
current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or
deleted as described in subclause 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\"

Unless the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI is zero,
the UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
maximum number of UEs reached as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and
shall not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over
the current access until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the
USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the
SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s)
are removed as described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

NOTE 15: If the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI in
the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is zero as
specified in subclause 10.5.7.4a of TS 24.008, the UE does not consider
the S-NSSAI as the rejected S-NSSAI.

If there is one or more S-NSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\", then for each S-NSSAI, the UE shall behave as follows:

a\) stop the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI, if running;

b\) start the timer T3526 with:

1\) the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI, if a
back-off timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI that is neither
zero nor deactivated; or

2\) an implementation specific back-off timer value, if no back-off
timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI; and

c\) remove the S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of
UEs reached when the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI expires.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.2.5, 4.6.1. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

\#62 (No network slices available).

The UE shall abort the initial registration procedure, set the 5GS
update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.
ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION or 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH. Additionally,
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REJECT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
S-NSSAI(s):

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN or SNPN\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN or SNPN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current PLMN or SNPN until
switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, an entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as described in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall
not attempt to use this S-NSSAI(s) in the current registration area
until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current
registration area, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the current
SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or deleted as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network
slice-specific authentication and authorization\"

The UE shall store the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
failed or revoked NSSAA as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and shall not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over any access
until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, the
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the
current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed or
deleted as described in subclause 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.2.

\"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\"

Unless the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI is zero,
the UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
maximum number of UEs reached as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and
shall not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over
the current access until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the
USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the
SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s)
are removed as described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

NOTE 6: If the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI in
the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is zero as
specified in subclause 10.5.7.4a of TS 24.008, the UE does not consider
the S-NSSAI as the rejected S-NSSAI.

If there is one or more S-NSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\", then for each S-NSSAI, the UE shall behave as follows:

a\) stop the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI, if running;

b\) start the timer T3526 with:

1\) the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI, if a
back-off timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI that is neither
zero nor deactivated; or

2\) an implementation specific back-off timer value, if no back-off
timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI; and

c\) remove the S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of
UEs reached when the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI expires.

If the UE has an allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI that contains
S-NSSAI(s) which are not included in the rejected NSSAI the UE may stay
in the current serving cell, apply the normal cell reselection process
and start an initial registration with a requested NSSAI that includes
any S-NSSAI from the allowed NSSAI or the configured NSSAI that is not
in the rejected NSSAI. Otherwise the UE may perform a PLMN selection or
SNPN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\] and additionally, the
UE may disable the N1 mode capability for the current PLMN or SNPN if
the UE does not have an allowed NSSAI and each S-NSSAI in configured
NSSAI, if available, was rejected with cause \"S-NSSAI not available in
the current PLMN or SNPN\" or \"S-NSSAI not available due to the failed
or revoked network slice-specific authentication and authorization\" as
described in subclause 4.9.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN nor
configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN and~,~

1\) if at least one S-NSSAI in the default configured NSSAI is not
rejected, the UE may stay in the current serving cell, apply the normal
cell reselection process, and start an initial registration with a
requested NSSAI with that default configured NSSAI; or

2\) if all the S-NSSAI(s) in the default configured NSSAI are rejected
and at least one S-NSSAI is rejected due to \"S-NSSAI not available in
the current registration area\",

i\) if the REGISTRATION REJECT message is integrity protected and the UE
is not operating in SNPN access operation mode, the UE shall store the
current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\"
and enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE; or

ii\) if the REGISTRATION REJECT message is integrity protected and the
UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode, the UE shall store the
current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\"
for the current SNPN and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

Otherwise, the UE may perform a PLMN selection or SNPN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\] and additionally, the UE may disable
the N1 mode capability for the current PLMN or SNPN if each S-NSSAI in
the default configured NSSAI was rejected with cause \"S-NSSAI not
available in the current PLMN or SNPN\" or \"S-NSSAI not available due
to the failed or revoked network slice-specific authentication and
authorization\" as described in subclause 4.9.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN nor
configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN and has rejected NSSAI for
the reached maximum number of UEs, and the UE wants to obtain services
in the current serving cell without performing a PLMN selection or SNPN
selection, the UE may stay in the current serving cell and attempt to
use the rejected S-NSSAI(s) for the maximum number of UEs reached in the
current serving cell after the rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed as
described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the EPS update
status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, reset the attach attempt counter and enter
the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.6.1\]

The rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is applicable
for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN, and the access type over which
the rejected NSSAI was sent. The AMF shall send a rejected NSSAI
including S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available
due to maximum number of UEs reached\", when one or more S-NSSAIs are
indicated that **the maximum number of UEs has been reached. If the
timer T3526 associated with the** S-NSSAI(s) **was started upon
reception of the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached,
the UE may** remove the S-NSSAI(s) from the rejected NSSAI including
S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to
maximum number of UEs reached\", if the timer **T3526 associated with
the** S-NSSAI(s) expires. If one or more S-NSSAIs are removed from the
rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, the timer T3526
associated with the removed S-NSSAI(s) shall be stopped, if running. The
UE shall not stop the timer T3526 if the UE selects an E-UTRA cell
connected to EPC.

If the UE receives a rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs
reached, the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different
PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the UE shall treat the received
rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached as applicable to
these equivalent PLMNs when the UE is in this registration area.

##### 9.1.12.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-73 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.4.4.3 & 10.2. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-17 requirements

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.4.3\]

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the
rejected S-NSSAI(s):

...

\"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\"

Unless the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI is zero,
the UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
maximum number of UEs reached as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and
shall not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over
the current access until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the
USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the
SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s)
are removed as described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

NOTE 3: If the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI in
the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is zero as
specified in subclause 10.5.7.4a of TS 24.008, the UE does not consider
the S-NSSAI as the rejected S-NSSAI.

If there is one or more S-NSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\", then for each S-NSSAI, the UE shall behave as follows:

a\) stop the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI, if running;

b\) start the timer T3526 with:

1\) the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI, if
back-off timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI that is neither
zero nor deactivated; or

2\) an implementation specific back-off timer value, if no back-off
timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI; and

c\) remove the S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of
UEs reached when the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI expires.

##### 9.1.12.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-74 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.2.3.1, 5.5.2.3.2. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-17 requirements

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.3.1\]

The network initiates the de-registration procedure by sending a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE (see example in
figure 5.5.2.3.1.1).

NOTE 1: If the AMF performs a local de-registration, it will inform the
UE with a 5GMM messages (e.g. SERVICE REJECT message or REGISTRATION
REJECT message) with 5GMM cause \#10 \"implicitly de-registered\" only
when the UE initiates a 5GMM procedure.

The network may include a 5GMM cause IE to specify the reason for the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. The network shall start timer T3522. The
network shall indicate whether re-registration is needed or not in the
De-registration type IE. The network shall also indicate via the access
type whether the de-registration procedure is:

a\) for 3GPP access only;

b\) for non-3GPP access only; or

c\) for 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both when the UE is registered
in the same PLMN for both accesses.

If the network de-registration is triggered due to network
slice-specific authentication and authorization failure or revocation as
specified in subclause 4.6.2.4, then the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#62 \"No network slices available\" in the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. In addition, if the UE supports extended
rejected NSSAI, the AMF shall include the Extended rejected NSSAI IE in
the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message; otherwise the AMF shall include the
Rejected NSSAI IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI and the network
de-registration is triggered due to mobility management based network
slice admission control as specified in subclause 4.6.2.5, then the
network shall set the 5GMM cause value to \#62 \"No network slices
available\" in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. In addition, the
network may include a back-off timer value for each S-NSSAI with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\" in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE of the DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

If the network de-registration is triggered for a UE supporting CAG due
to CAG restrictions, the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to \#76
\"Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only\" and
should include the \"CAG information list\" in the CAG information list
IE or the Extended CAG information list IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.3.2\]

Upon receiving the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message, if the DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message includes the rejected NSSAI, the UE takes the following
actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected S-NSSAI(s):

...

\"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
maximum number of UEs reached as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and
shall not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over
the current access until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the
USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the
SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s)
are removed as described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If there is one or more S-NSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\", then for each S-NSSAI, the UE shall behave as follows:

a\) stop the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI, if running;

b\) start the timer T3526 with:

1\) the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI, if a
back-off timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI that is neither
zero nor deactivated; or

2\) an implementation specific back-off timer value, if no back-off
timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI; and

c\) remove the S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of
UEs reached when the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI expires.

Upon sending a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall delete the
rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration not required\",
the UE shall take the actions depending on the received 5GMM cause
value:

...

\#62 (No network slices available).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter
state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE or 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.
Additionally, the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST
message takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the
rejected S-NSSAI(s):

\...

\"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached\"

Unless the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI is zero,
the UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
maximum number of UEs reached as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and
shall not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN or SNPN over
the current access until switching off the UE, the UICC containing the
USIM is removed, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the
SNPN identity of the current SNPN is updated, or the rejected S-NSSAI(s)
are removed as described in subclauses 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.2.

NOTE 3: If the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI in
the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is zero as
specified in subclause 10.5.7.4a of 3GPP TS 24.008 \[12\], the UE does
not consider the S-NSSAI as the rejected S-NSSAI.

If there is one or more S-NSSAIs in the rejected NSSAI with the
rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs
reached\", then for each S-NSSAI, the UE shall behave as follows:

a\) stop the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI, if running;

b\) start the timer T3526 with:

1\) the back-off timer value received along with the S-NSSAI, if a
back-off timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI that is neither
zero nor deactivated; or

2\) an implementation specific back-off timer value, if no back-off
timer value is received along with the S-NSSAI; and

c\) remove the S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of
UEs reached when the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI expires.

\...

If

1)  the UE has allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN or configured
    NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN or both and all the S-NSSAIs
    included in the allowed NSSAI or the configured NSSAI or both are
    rejected; or

2)  the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN nor
    configured NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN and all the S-NSSAIs
    included in the default configured NSSAI are rejected,

and the UE has rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, and
the UE wants to obtain services in the current serving cell without
performing a PLMN selection or SNPN selection, the UE may stay in the
current serving cell and attempt to use the rejected S-NSSAI(s) for the
maximum number of UEs reached in the current serving cell after the
rejected S-NSSAI(s) are removed as described in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the de-registration request is for 3GPP access only or for both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the EPS update
status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, reset the attach attempt counter and enter
the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

##### 9.1.13.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-75 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.2 and 10.2. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE performs initial registration for 5GS services;

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

c\) when the UE performs initial registration for SMS over NAS;

d\) when the UE moves from GERAN to NG-RAN coverage or the UE moves from
a UTRAN to NG-RAN coverage and the following applies:

1\) the UE initiated a GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure
while in A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or

2\) the UE has performed 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN as specified in
3GPP TS 23.216 \[6A\],

and since then the UE did not perform a successful EPS attach or
tracking area updating procedure in S1 mode or registration procedure in
N1 mode;

e\) when the UE performs initial registration for onboarding services in
SNPN; and

f\) when the UE performs initial registration for disaster roaming
services;

\...

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the
current PLMN or SNPN, if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAI
nor associated to the S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI. In addition, if
the NSSRG information is available, the subset of configured NSSAI
provided in the requested NSSAI shall be associated with at least one
common NSSRG value. If the UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state over the other
access and has already an allowed NSSAI for the other access, all the
S-NSSAI(s) in the requested NSSAI for the current access shall share at
least an NSSRG value common to all the S-NSSAI(s) of the allowed NSSAI
for the other access. If the UE is simultaneously performing the
registration procedure on the other access, the UE shall include
S-NSSAIs that share at least a common NSSRG value across all access
types.

\...

If the UE supports the NSSRG, then the UE shall set the NSSRG bit to
\"NSSRG supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message.

##### 9.1.13.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-76 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.2. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for initial registration by sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST
message to the AMF,

a\) when the UE performs initial registration for 5GS services;

b\) when the UE performs initial registration for emergency services;

c\) when the UE performs initial registration for SMS over NAS;

d\) when the UE moves from GERAN to NG-RAN coverage or the UE moves from
a UTRAN to NG-RAN coverage and the following applies:

1\) the UE initiated a GPRS attach or routing area updating procedure
while in A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or

2\) the UE has performed 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN as specified in
3GPP TS 23.216 \[6A\],

and since then the UE did not perform a successful EPS attach or
tracking area updating procedure in S1 mode or registration procedure in
N1 mode;

e\) when the UE performs initial registration for onboarding services in
SNPN; and

f\) when the UE performs initial registration for disaster roaming
services;

...

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the
current PLMN or SNPN, if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAI
nor associated to the S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI. In addition, if
the NSSRG information is available, the subset of configured NSSAI
provided in the requested NSSAI shall be associated with at least one
common NSSRG value. If the UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED state over the other
access and has already an allowed NSSAI for the other access, all the
S-NSSAI(s) in the requested NSSAI for the current access shall share at
least an NSSRG value common to all the S-NSSAI(s) of the allowed NSSAI
for the other access. If the UE is simultaneously performing the
registration procedure on the other access, the UE shall include
S-NSSAIs that share at least a common NSSRG value across all access
types.

If the UE supports the unavailability period, the UE shall set the
UN-PER bit to \"unavailability period supported\" in the 5GMM capability
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

...

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.3\]

Upon receiving the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall
stop timer T3346 if running and use the contents to update appropriate
information stored within the UE.

If \"acknowledgement requested\" is indicated in the Acknowledgement bit
of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE
message.

...

If the UE receives a new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new configured NSSAI for the
registered PLMN or SNPN as valid and the old configured NSSAI for the
registered PLMN or SNPN as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the
old configured NSSAI for the registered PLMN or SNPN as valid. The UE
shall store the new configured NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.
In addition, if the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message contains an
NSSRG information IE, the UE shall store the contents of the NSSRG
information IE as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2. If the UE receives a
new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and no
NSSRG information IE, the UE shall delete any stored NSSRG information,
if any, as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If PEI and subgrouping are configured, UEs monitoring the same PO can be
divided into one or more subgroups. With subgrouping, the UE monitors
the associated PO if the corresponding bit for subgroup the UE belongs
to is indicated as 1 by PEI corresponding to its PO, as specified in
clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 \[4\].

The following parameters are used for the determination of subgroup ID:

\- subgroupsNumPerPO: total number of subgroups for both CN assigned
subgrouping (if any) and UE\_ID based subgrouping (if any) in a PO,
which is broadcasted in system information;

\- subgroupsNumForUEID: number of subgroups for UE\_ID based subgrouping
in a PO, which is broadcasted in system information.

\[TS 38.304, clause 7.2.1\]

The UE monitors one PEI occasion per DRX cycle. A PEI occasion (PEI-O)
is a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions (MOs) and can consist of multiple
time slots (e.g. subframes or OFDM symbols) where PEI can be sent (TS
38.213 \[4\]). In multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the same
PEI is repeated in all transmitted beams and thus the selection of the
beam(s) for the reception of the PEI is up to UE implementation.

}

##### 9.2.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-80 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.4.2.1, 5.4.2.3 and 5.4.2.5.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.1\]

The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take a 5G
NAS security context into use, and initialise and start NAS signalling
security between the UE and the AMF with the corresponding 5G NAS keys
and 5G NAS security algorithms.

Furthermore, the network may also initiate the security mode control
procedure in the following cases:

a)- in order to change the 5G NAS security algorithms for a current 5G
NAS security context already in use;

b\) in order to change the value of uplink NAS COUNT used in the latest
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\], subclause 6.9.4.4; and

c\) in order to provide the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms to the
UE

For restrictions concerning the concurrent running of a security mode
control procedure with other security related procedures in the AS or
inside the core network see 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\], subclause 6.9.5.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.3\]

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall check
whether the security mode command can be accepted or not. This is done
by performing the integrity check of the message, and by checking that
the received Replayed UE security capabilities IE has not been altered
compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the network.

When the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes an EAP-success message
the UE handles the EAP-success message and the ABBA as described in
subclause 5.4.1.2.2.8.

If the UE is registered for emergency services, performing initial
registration for emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU
session and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received with ngKSI
value \"000\" and 5G-IA0 and 5G-EA0 as selected 5G NAS security
algorithms, the UE shall locally derive and take in use 5G NAS security
context. The UE shall delete existing current 5G NAS security context.

The UE shall ignore the Replayed S1 UE security capabilities IE if this
IE is included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the
\"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-EA0 as the selected 5G NAS
integrity algorithm only if the message is received when the UE is
registered for emergency services, performing initial registration for
emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU session.

If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message is set to \"native security context\" and if the ngKSI
matches a valid non-current native 5G NAS security context held in the
UE while the UE has a mapped 5G NAS security context as the current 5G
NAS security context, the UE shall take the non-current native 5G NAS
security context into use which then becomes the current native 5G NAS
security context and delete the mapped 5G NAS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall take
the 5G NAS security context indicated in the message into use. The UE
shall in addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if:

a\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take a 5G
NAS security context into use created after a successful execution of
the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or
the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure; or

b\) the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of
security context flag set to \"mapped security context\" in the NAS key
set identifier IE the ngKSI does not match the current 5G NAS security
context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted and a new 5G NAS
security context is taken into use and SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
does not indicate the \"null integrity protection algorithm\" 5G-IA0 as
the selected NAS integrity algorithm, the UE shall:

\- if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has been successfully integrity
checked using an estimated downlink NAS COUNT equal to 0, then the UE
shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5G NAS security context to
0;

\- otherwise the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new 5G NAS
security context to the downlink NAS COUNT that has been used for the
successful integrity checking of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the horizontal derivation
parameter indicating \"K~AMF~ derivation is required\", the UE shall
derive a new K\'~AMF~, as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\] for K~AMF~
to K\'~AMF~ derivation in mobility, and set both uplink and downlink NAS
COUNTs to zero. When the new 5G NAS security context is taken into use
for current access and the UE is registered with the same PLMN over the
3GPP access and the non-3GPP access:

a\) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over the non-current access, the AMF and
the UE shall activate the new 5G NAS security context over the
non-current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]. The AMF and
the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero for
the non-current access; or

b\) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-current access, the
AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the non-current
access to activate the new 5G NAS security context that was activated
over the current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]. The AMF
shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to
identify the new 5G NAS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the horizontal derivation
parameter indicating \"K~AMF~ derivation is not required\" or the
Additional 5G security parameters IE is not included in the message, the
UE is registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access, then after the completion of a security mode control procedure
over the current access:

a\) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over the non-current access, the AMF and
the UE shall activate the new 5G NAS security context for the
non-current access. If a primary authentication and key agreement
procedure was completed before the security mode control procedure, the
AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to
zero for the non-current access, otherwise the downlink NAS COUNT and
uplink NAS COUNT for the non-3GPP access are not changed; or

b\) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-current access, the
AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the non-current
access to activate the new 5G NAS security context that was activated
over the current access as described in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]. The AMF
shall include the same ngKSI in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to
identify the new 5G NAS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall send
a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected
5GS integrity algorithm and the 5G NAS integrity key based on the K~AMF~
or mapped K\'~AMF~ if the type of security context flag is set to
\"mapped security context\" indicated by the ngKSI. When the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message includes the type of security context flag set to
\"mapped security context\" in the NAS key set identifier IE, then the
UE shall check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the
ngKSI of the current 5GS security context, if it is a mapped 5G NAS
security context, in order not to re-generate the K\'~AMF~.

Furthermore, if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the
UE shall cipher the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message with the selected 5GS
ciphering algorithm and the 5GS NAS ciphering key based on the K~AMF~ or
mapped K\'~AMF~ indicated by the ngKSI. The UE shall set the security
header type of the message to \"integrity protected and ciphered with
new 5G NAS security context\".

From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS
signalling messages with the selected 5GS integrity and ciphering
algorithms.

If the AMF indicated in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that the
IMEISV is requested, the UE shall include its IMEISV in the SECURITY
MODE COMPLETE message.

If, during an ongoing registration procedure or service request
procedure, the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes the Additional 5G
security information IE with the RINMR bit set to \"Retransmission of
the initial NAS message requested\", the UE shall include the entire
uncyphered REGISTRATION REQUEST message or SERVICE REQUEST message,
which the UE had previously included in the NAS message container IE of
the initial NAS message (i.e. REGISTRATION REQUEST message or SERVICE
REQUEST message, respectively), in the NAS message container IE of the
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

If, prior to receiving the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE without
a valid 5GS NAS security context had sent a REGISTRATION REQUEST message
the UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message in the NAS
message container IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described
in subclause 4.4.6.

If the UE operating in the single-registration mode receives the
Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE, the UE shall use the IE
according to 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\].

For a UE operating in single-registration mode with N26 interface
supported in the network, after an inter-system change from S1 mode to
N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall set the value of the
Selected EPS NAS security algorithms IE in the 5G NAS security context
to the NAS security algorithms that were received from the source MME
when the UE was in S1 mode.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.2.5\]

If the security mode command cannot be accepted, the UE shall send a
SECURITY MODE REJECT message. The SECURITY MODE REJECT message contains
a 5GMM cause that typically indicates one of the following cause values:

\#23 UE security capabilities mismatch.

\#24 security mode rejected, unspecified.

If the UE detects that the received Replayed UE security capabilities IE
has been altered compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the
network, the UE shall set the cause value to \#23 \"UE security
capabilities mismatch\".

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE REJECT message, the AMF shall stop
timer T3560. The AMF shall also abort the ongoing procedure that
triggered the initiation of the NAS security mode control procedure.

Both the UE and the AMF shall apply the 5G NAS security context in use
before the initiation of the security mode control procedure, if any, to
protect the SECURITY MODE REJECT message and any other subsequent
messages according to the rules in subclause 4.4.4 and 4.4.5.

##### 9.2.4.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-82 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 4.6.2.2, 5.4.4.1, 5.4.4.2 and 5.4.4.3.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 4.6.2.2\]

If available, the configured NSSAI(s) shall be stored in a non-volatile
memory in the ME as specified in annex C.

...

If the UE receives the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message indicating
\"registration requested\" and contains no other parameters (see
subclauses 5.4.4.2 and 5.4.4.3), the UE shall delete any stored allowed
NSSAI for this PLMN, and delete any stored mapping of each S-NSSAI of
the allowed NSSAI to the S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN, if available;

...

d\) When the UE receives the Network slicing indication IE with the
Network slicing subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing
subscription changed\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall delete the network
slicing information for each of the PLMNs that the UE has slicing
information stored for (excluding the current PLMN). The UE shall not
delete the default configured NSSAI. Additionally, the UE shall update
the network slicing information for the current PLMN (if received) as
specified above in bullets a), b) and c):

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.1\]

The purpose of this procedure is to:

a\) allow the AMF to update the UE configuration for access and mobility
management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF by
providing new parameter information within the command; or

b\) request the UE to perform a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update towards the network to update access and
mobility management-related parameters decided and provided by the AMF
(see subclause 5.5.1.3).

This procedure is initiated by the network and can only be used when the
UE has an established 5GMM context, and the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode. When the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the AMF may use the paging or
notification procedure to initiate the generic UE configuration update
procedure. The AMF can request a confirmation response in order to
ensure that the parameter has been updated by the UE.

This procedure shall be initiated by the network to assign a new 5G-GUTI
to the UE after a successful service request procedure invoked as a
response to a paging request from the network and before the release of
the N1 NAS signalling connection. If the service request procedure was
triggered due to 5GSM downlink signalling pending, the procedure for
assigning a new 5G-GUTI can be initiated by the network after the
transport of the 5GSM downlink signalling.

The following parameters are supported by the generic UE configuration
update procedure without the need to request the UE to perform the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update:

a\) 5G-GUTI;

b\) TAI list;

c\) Service area list;

d\) Network identity and time zone information (Full name for network,
short name for network, local time zone, universal time and local time
zone, network daylight saving time);

e\) LADN information;

f\) Rejected NSSAI;r

g\) Network slicing indication;

h\) Operator-defined access category definitions; and

i\) SMS indication.

The following parameters can be sent to the UE with or without a request
to perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update:

a\) Allowed NSSAI; or

b\) Configured NSSAI.

The following parameter is sent to the UE with a request to perform the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update:

a\) MICO indication.

The following parameters are sent over 3GPP access only:

a\) LADN information;

b\) MICO indication;

c\) TAI list; and

d\) Service area list.

The following parameters are managed and sent per access type i.e.,
independently over 3GPP access or non 3GPP access:

a\) Allowed NSSAI; and

b\) Rejected NSSAI (when the NSSAI is rejected for the current
registration area).

The following parameters are managed commonly and sent over 3GPP access
or non 3GPP access:

a\) 5G-GUTI;

b\) Network identity and time zone information;

c\) Rejected NSSAI (when the NSSAI is rejected for the current PLMN);

Figure 5.4.4.1.1: Generic UE configuration update procedure

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.2\]

The AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure by
sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UE.

The AMF shall in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message either:

a\) include one or more of the following parameters: 5G-GUTI, TAI list,
allowed NSSAI that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), LADN information,
service area list, MICO indication NITZ information, configured NSSAI
that may include the mapped S-NSSAI(s), rejected NSSAI, network slicing
indication, operator-defined access category definitions or SMS
indication;

b\) include the Configuration update indication IE with the Registration
requested bit set to \"registration requested\"; or

c\) include a combination of both a) and b).

If an acknowledgement from the UE is requested, the AMF shall indicate
\"acknowledgement requested\" in the Acknowledgement bit of the
Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message and shall start timer T3555. Acknowledgement shall be requested
for all parameters except when only NITZ is included.

To initiate parameter re-negotiation between the UE and network, the AMF
shall indicate \"registration requested\" in the Registration requested
bit of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message.

If a new allowed NSSAI information or AMF re-configuration of supported
S-NSSAIs requires an AMF relocation, the AMF shall indicate
\"registration requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the
Configuration update indication IE and include the Allowed NSSAI IE in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.

If the AMF includes a new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message and the new configured NSSAI requires an AMF relocation
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the AMF shall indicate
\"registration requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the
Configuration update indication IE in the message.

If the AMF indicates \"registration requested\" in the Registration
requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE, acknowledgement
shall be requested.

If changes to the allowed NSSAI require the UE to initiate a
registration procedure, but the AMF is unable to determine an allowed
NSSAI for the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message shall indicate \"registration requested\" in the
Registration requested bit of the Configuration update indication IE,
and shall not contain any other parameters.

If the AMF needs to update the LADN information, the AMF shall include
the LADN information in the LADN information IE of the CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message.

During an established 5GMM context, the network may send none, one, or
more CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND messages to the UE. If more than one
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is sent, the messages need not have
the same content.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.4.4.3\]

Upon receiving the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall
stop timer T3346 if running and use the contents to update appropriate
information stored within the UE.

If \"acknowledgement requested\" is indicated in the Acknowledgement bit
of the Configuration update indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMPLETE
message.

If the UE receives a new 5G-GUTI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall consider the new 5G-GUTI as valid, the old 5G-GUTI
as invalid, stop timer T3519 if running, and delete any stored SUCI;
otherwise, the UE shall consider the old 5G-GUTI as valid. The UE shall
provide the 5G-GUTI to the lower layer of 3GPP access if the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is sent over the non-3GPP access,
and the UE is in 5GMM-REGISTERED in both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
in the same PLMN.

If the UE receives a new TAI list in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI
list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as
valid.

If the UE receives a new service area list in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new service area list as
valid and the old service area list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall
consider the old service area list, if any, as valid.

If the UE receives new NITZ information in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE considers the new NITZ information as valid and
the old NITZ information as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider
the old NITZ information as valid.

If the UE receives a LADN information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the old LADN information as
invalid and the new LADN information as valid, if any; otherwise, the UE
shall consider the old LADN information as valid.

If the UE receives a new allowed NSSAI for the associated access type in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new
allowed NSSAI as valid for the associated access type, store the allowed
NSSAI for the associated access type as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2
and consider the old allowed NSSAI for the associated access type as
invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old Allowed NSSAI as valid
for the associated access type.

If the UE receives a new configured NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message, the UE shall consider the new configured NSSAI for the
registered PLMN as valid and the old configured NSSAI for the registered
PLMN as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old configured
NSSAI for the registered PLMN as valid The UE shall store the new
configured NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the UE receives the Network slicing indication IE in the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the Network slicing
subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing subscription
changed\", the UE shall delete the network slicing information for each
and every PLMN except for the current PLMN as specified in
subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the UE receives Operator-defined access category definitions IE in
the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and the Operator-defined access
category definitions IE contains one or more operator-defined access
category definitions, the UE shall delete any operator-defined access
category definitions stored for the RPLMN and shall store the received
operator-defined access category definitions for the RPLMN. If the UE
receives the Operator-defined access category definitions IE in the
CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and the Operator-defined access
category definitions IE contains no operator-defined access category
definitions, the UE shall delete any operator-defined access category
definitions stored for the RPLMN. If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message does not contain the Operator-defined access category
definitions IE, the UE shall not delete the operator-defined access
category definitions stored for the RPLMN.

If the UE receives the SMS indication IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE
COMMAND message with the SMS availability indication set to:

a\) \"SMS over NAS not available\", the UE shall consider that SMS over
NAS transport is not allowed by the network; and

b\) \"SMS over NAS available\", the UE may request the use of SMS over
NAS transport by performing a registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3, after
the completion of the generic UE configuration update procedure.

If the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message indicates \"registration
requested\" in the Registration requested bit of the Configuration
update indication IE and:

a\) contains no other parameters or contains at least one of the
following parameters: a new allowed NSSAI, a new configured NSSAI or the
Network slicing subscription change indication, and:

1\) an emergency PDU session exists, the UE shall, after the completion
of the generic UE configuration update procedure and the release of the
emergency PDU session, release the existing N1 NAS signalling
connection, and start a registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3; or

2\) no emergency PDU Session exists, the UE shall, after the completion
of the generic UE configuration update procedure and the release of the
existing N1 NAS signalling connection, start a registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update as specified in
subclause 5.5.1.3; or

b\) an MICO indication is included without a new allowed NSSAI or a new
configured NSSAI, the UE shall, after the completion of the generic UE
configuration update procedure, start a registration procedure for
mobility and registration update as specified in subclause 5.5.1.3 to
re-negotiate MICO mode with the network.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the
rejected NSSAI:

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not attempt to use
this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current registration area as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not
attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current registration area until
switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the current registration area
or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

##### 9.2.5.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-83 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.2.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

The UE initiates the registration procedure for initial registration by
sending a REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF, starting timer T3510.
If timer T3502 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3502. If
timer T3511 is currently running, the UE shall stop timer T3511.

During initial registration the UE handles the 5GS mobile identity IE in
the following order:

...

b\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, by the same PLMN with which the UE is
performing the registration, the UE shall indicate the 5G-GUTI in the
5GS mobile identity IE;

c\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, by an equivalent PLMN, the UE shall
indicate the 5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE;

d\) if the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned, over
3GPP access or non-3GPP, by any other PLMN, the UE shall indicate the
5G-GUTI in the 5GS mobile identity IE;

e\) if a SUCI is available the UE shall include the SUCI in the 5GS
mobile identity IE; and

If the SUCI is included in the 5GS mobile identity IE and the timer
T3519 is not running, the UE shall start timer T3519 and store the value
of the SUCI sent in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. The UE shall
include the stored SUCI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message while timer
T3519 is running.

...

If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include
the last visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

The 5G-GUTI reallocation shall be part of the initial registration
procedure. During the initial registration procedure, if the AMF has not
allocated a new 5G-GUTI by the generic UE configuration update
procedure, the AMF shall include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the
new assigned 5G-GUTI together with the assigned TAI list.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.2.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.2\]

5.5.1.2.1 General

This procedure can be used by a UE for initial registration for 5GS
services.

...

The UE shall include the requested NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s)
corresponding to the slice(s) to which the UE wants to register and
shall include the mapping of the requested NSSAI which is the mapping of
each S-NSSAI of the requested NSSAI to the S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN, if
available, in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the UE has allowed
NSSAI or configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, the requested NSSAI
shall be either:

a\) the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN;

b\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or

c\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for
which no corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and those
are neither in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN nor in the
rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and registration area combination.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN nor configured
NSSAI for the current PLMN and has a default configured NSSAI, the UE
shall:

a\) include the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message using the default configured NSSAI; and

b\) include the Network slicing indication IE with the Default
configured NSSAI indication bit set to \"Requested NSSAI created from
default configured NSSAI\" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, no configured NSSAI
for the current PLMN, and no default configured NSSAI, the UE shall not
include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION message.

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to the
current PLMN, if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN nor in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN and
registration area combination.

The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of
one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN.

NOTE 3: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed
NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation.

NOTE 4: The number of S-NSSAI(s) included in the requested NSSAI cannot
exceed eight.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.1.2.4\]

The AMF shall include the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN and shall
include the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the allowed NSSAI to the
S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN contained in the requested NSSAI from the UE if
available, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UE included the
requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and the AMF allows
one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI. The AMF may also include
rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. Rejected NSSAI
contains S-NSSAI(s) which was included in the requested NSSAI but
rejected by the network associated with rejection cause(s).

The AMF may include a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if:

a\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message did not include the requested
NSSAI;

b\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the requested NSSAI
containing an S-NSSAI that is not valid in the serving PLMN; or

c\) the REGISTRATION REQUEST message included the Network slicing
indication IE with the Default configured NSSAI indication bit set to
\"Requested NSSAI created from default configured NSSAI\".

If a new configured NSSAI for the current PLMN is included in the
REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the AMF shall also include the mapping of
the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN the S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN if
available in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message. In this case the AMF shall
start timer T3550 and enter state 5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as
described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The AMF shall include the Network slicing indication IE with the Network
slicing subscription change indication set to \"Network slicing
subscription changed\" in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message if the UDM has
indicated that the subscription data for network slicing has changed. In
this case the AMF shall start timer T3550 and enter state
5GMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause 5.1.3.2.3.3.

The UE receiving the rejected NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message
takes the following actions based on the rejection cause in the rejected
NSSAI:

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current PLMN\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2 and not attempt to use
this S-NSSAI in the current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed.

\"S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area\"

The UE shall add the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the
current PLMN and registration area combination as specified in
subclause 4.6.2.2 and not attempt to use this S-NSSAI in the current
registration area until switching off the UE, the UE moving out of the
current registration area or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE did not include the requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or none of the requested NSSAI are present in the
subscribed S-NSSAIs, and one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs (containing one
or more S-NSSAIs each of which may be associated with a new S-NSSAI)
marked as default are available, the AMF shall put the subscribed
S-NSSAIs marked as default in the allowed NSSAI of the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT message. The AMF shall determine a registration area such that
all S-NSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI are available in the registration
area.

##### 9.2.5.1.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-85 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.1.2.5 and 5.5.1.2.7 and TS 24.301,
clause 5.5.1.2.5. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

If the initial registration request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the 5GMM
cause value to \#22 \"congestion\" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\#3 (Illegal UE); or

\#6 (Illegal ME).

...

\#22 (Congestion).

If the T3346 value IE is present in the REGISTRATION REJECT message and
the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the
UE shall proceed as described below; otherwise it shall be considered as
an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified
in subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

The UE shall abort the initial registration procedure, set the 5GS
update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION.

The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall
start timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.

If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE
shall start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[12\].

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The initial registration procedure is started if
still needed when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status, and attach attempt
counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the case when the EPS
attach request procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same
value.

...

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.7\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) Timer T3346 is running.

The UE shall not start the registration procedure for initial
registration unless:

1\) the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN;

2\) the UE needs to perform the registration procedure for initial
registration for emergency services; or

3\) the UE receives a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with the
\"re-registration required\" indication.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.

NOTE 1: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a
registration procedure for initial registration while timer T3346 is
running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an
abnormal case or a non-successful case.

\[TS 24.301, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

...

\#22 (Congestion);

If the T3346 value IE is present in the ATTACH REJECT message and the
value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall proceed as described below; otherwise it shall be considered as an
abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2.6.

The UE shall abort the attach procedure, reset the attach attempt
counter, set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

If the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start
timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.

If the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall
start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[13\].

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The attach procedure is started if still needed
when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status and GPRS attach
attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[13\] for the case when
the normal attach procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same
value.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\] for the case when the initial registration
procedure is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

##### 9.2.5.2.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-86 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 5.5.1.3.2. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.3.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by sending a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF,

\...

l\) when the UE needs to register for SMS over NAS, indicate a change in
the requirements to use SMS over NAS, or de-register from SMS over NAS;

\...

For a REGISTRATION REQUEST message with a 5GS registration type IE
indicating \"mobility registration updating\", UE shall include the
requested NSSAI containing the S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to the slices to
which the UE intends to register with and shall include the mapped
S-NSSAI(s) for the requested NSSAI, if available, in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message. If the UE has allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI for the
current PLMN, the requested NSSAI shall be either:

a\) the configured NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN;

b\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, if the UE has an allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN; or

c\) the allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, or a subset thereof as
described below, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the configured NSSAI for
which no corresponding S-NSSAI is present in the allowed NSSAI and those
are neither in the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN nor in the
rejected NSSAI for the current registration area.

If the UE has neither allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN nor configured
NSSAI for the current PLMN and has a default configured NSSAI, the UE
shall:

a\) include the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI IE of the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message using the default configured NSSAI; and

b\) include the Network slicing indication IE with the Default
configured NSSAI indication bit set to \"Requested NSSAI created from
default configured NSSAI\" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

If the UE has no allowed NSSAI for the current PLMN, no configured NSSAI
for the current PLMN, and no default configured NSSAI, the UE shall not
include a requested NSSAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

The subset of configured NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists
of one or more S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI applicable to this PLMN,
if the S-NSSAI is neither in the rejected NSSAIs for the current PLMN
nor in the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area.

The subset of allowed NSSAI provided in the requested NSSAI consists of
one or more S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI for this PLMN.

NOTE 3: How the UE selects the subset of configured NSSAI or allowed
NSSAI to be provided in the requested NSSAI is implementation specific.
The UE can take preferences indicated by the upper layers (e.g.
policies, applications) into account.

##### 9.2.6.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-87 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.5.2.1, 5.5.2.2.1 and 5.5.2.2.6.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.1\]

The de-registration procedure is used:

a\) by the UE to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the
UE is registered over 3GPP access;;

b\) by the UE to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP
access, or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both
accesses;

c\) by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS
services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access;

d\) by the network to inform the UE that it is deregistered for 5GS
services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP access, or both when the UE is
registered in the same PLMN over both accesses; and

e\) by the network to inform the UE to re-register to the network.

The de-registration procedure with appropriate de-registration type
shall be invoked by the UE:

a\) if the UE is switched off; and

b\) as part of the eCall inactivity procedure defined in
subclause 5.5.3.

The de-registration procedure with appropriate de-registration type
shall be invoked by the network:

a\) if the network informs whether the UE should re-register to the
network.

The de-registration procedure with appropriate access type shall be
invoked by the UE:

a\) if the UE wants to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access
when the UE is registered over 3GPP access; or

b\) the UE wants to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access,
non-3GPP access, or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over
both accesses.

If the de-registration procedure is triggered due to USIM removal, the
UE shall indicate \"switch off\" in the de-registration type IE.

If the de-registration procedure is requested by the UDM for a UE that
has an emergency PDU session, the AMF shall not send a DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message to the UE.

If the de-registration procedure for 5GS services is performed, the PDU
sessions, if any, for this particular UE are released locally without
peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the network.

The UE is allowed to initiate the de-registration procedure even if the
timer T3346 is running.

NOTE: When the UE has no PDU sessions over non-3GPP access, or the UE
moves all the PDU sessions over a non-3GPP access to a 3GPP access, the
UE and the AMF need not initiate de-registration over the non-3GPP
access.

The AMF shall provide the UE with a non-3GPP de-registration timer.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.2.1\]

The de-registration procedure is initiated by the UE by sending a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message (see example in figure 5.5.2.2.1). The
De-registration type IE included in the message indicates whether the
de-registration procedure is due to a \"switch off\" or not. The access
type included in the message indicates whether the de-registration
procedure is:

a\) for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over
3GPP access only;

b\) for 5GS services over non-3GPP access when the UE is registered over
non-3GPP access only; or

c\) for 5GS services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access when the UE is registered in the same PLMN
over both accesses.

If the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile
identity IE with the valid 5G-GUTI. If the UE does not have a valid
5G-GUTI, the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile identity IE with its SUCI.

If the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI and it does not have a valid
SUCI, then the UE shall populate the5GSmobile identity IE with its PEI.

If the de-registration request is not due to switch off and the UE is in
the state 5GMM-REGISTERED or 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED, timer T3521
shall be started in the UE after the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has
been sent. The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED.

If the UE is to be switched off, the UE shall try for a period of 5
seconds to send the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. During this period,
the UE may be switched off as soon as the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message
has been sent.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.2.6\]

\...

c\) T3521 timeout.

On the first four expiries of the timer, the UE shall retransmit the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message and shall reset and restart timer T3521.
On the fifth expiry of timer T3521, the de-registration procedure shall
be aborted and the UE proceeds as follows:

**when** { the SS sends a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates
\"re-registration required\" and the de-registration request is for non
3GPP access }

**then** { the UE sends a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the network
and releases the existing NAS signalling connection, then initiates an
initial registration and also re-establishes any previously established
PDU sessions }

}

##### 9.2.6.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-88 .H6}

References: The conformance requirement covered in the present TC is
specified in: 3GPP TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.2.3.2. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501 clause 5.5.2.3.2\]

NOTE 1: When the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration
required\", user interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE
cannot re-establish the PDU session (s), if any, automatically.

...

Upon sending a DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the UE shall delete the
rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause 4.6.2.2.

If the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration required\", then
the UE shall ignore the 5GMM cause IE if received.

If the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration not required\",
the UE shall take the actions depending on the received 5GMM cause
value:

\#3 (Illegal UE);

\#6 (Illegal ME); or

\#7 (5GS services not allowed).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. The UE shall
consider the USIM as invalid for 5GS services until switching off or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed. The UE shall delete the list of
equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]
for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the EMM cause with
the same value and with detach type set to \"re-attach not required\".

NOTE 2: The possibility to configure a UE so that the radio transceiver
for a specific radio access technology is not active, although it is
implemented in the UE, is out of scope of the present specification.

If the UE also supports the registration procedure over the other
access, the UE shall in addition handle 5GMM parameters and 5GMM state
for this access, as described for this 5GMM cause value.

\...

\#72 (Non-3GPP access to 5GCN not allowed).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally,
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

NOTE 3: The 5GMM sublayer states, the 5GMM parameters and the
registration status are managed per access type independently, i.e. 3GPP
access or non-3GPP access (see subclauses 4.7.2 and 5.1.3).

The UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for non-3GPP access (see
subclause 4.9.3).

As an implementation option, the UE may enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

##### 9.2.6.2.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-89 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clauses 5.5.2.3.2 and 5.5.2.3.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.3.2\]

Upon receiving the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message, if the DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST message indicates \"re-registration not required\" and the
de-registration request is for 3GPP access, the UE shall release locally
the PDU sessions over 3GPP access, if any. The UE shall send a
DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the network and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED for 3GPP access.

\...

If the de-registration type indicates \"re-registration not required\",
the UE shall take the actions depending on the received 5GMM cause
value:

\...

\#7 (5GS services not allowed).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete any
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. The UE shall
consider the USIM as invalid for 5GS services until switching off or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed. The UE shall delete the list of
equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]
for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the EMM cause with
the same value and with detach type set to \"re-attach not required\".

NOTE 2: The possibility to configure a UE so that the radio transceiver
for a specific radio access technology is not active, although it is
implemented in the UE, is out of scope of the present specification.

If the UE also supports the registration procedure over the other
access, the UE shall in addition handle 5GMM parameters and 5GMM state
for this access, as described for this 5GMM cause value.

\...

\#72 (Non-3GPP access to 5GCN not allowed).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally,
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

NOTE 3: The 5GMM sublayer states, the 5GMM parameters and the
registration status are managed per access type independently, i.e. 3GPP
access or non-3GPP access (see subclauses 4.7.2 and 5.1.3).

The UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for non-3GPP access (see
subclause 4.9.3).

As an implementation option, the UE may enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.2.3.4\]

b\) DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, other 5GMM cause values than those treated
in subclause 5.5.2.3.2 or no 5GMM cause IE is included, and the
De-registration type IE indicates \"re-registration not required\".

The UE shall delete 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list
of equivalent PLMNs, ngKSI, shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT
UPDATED and shall start timer T3502.

A UE not supporting S1 mode may enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]; otherwise the UE shall enter the
state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION.

A UE operating in single-registration mode shall:

\- enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED and attempt to select E-UTRAN radio
access technology and proceed with the appropriate EMM specific
procedures. In this case, the UE may disable N1 mode capability (see
subclause 4.9); or

\- enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a
PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

A UE operating in single-registration mode shall set the EPS update
status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and shall delete the EMM parameters 4G-GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI and shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.

##### 9.3.1.1.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-93 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-230 .H6}

**with** { UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED and 5GMM-IDLE on a 5GC NR cell
and has been previously registered on EPC as well, UE supporting S1 and
N1 and operating in single-registration mode, NWK supporting
Single-registration mode with N26 interface }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE detects a suitable EPC E-UTRA cell after the serving NGC
cell becomes not suitable }

**then** { UE performs a Inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode by
initiating and successfully completing a TAU procedure, mapped EPC
context used }

##### 9.3.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-93 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 5.1.4.2; TS 24.301 \[21\],
subclause 4.4.2.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.1.4.2\]

At Inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode when there is at least
one active PDU session for which interworking with EPS is supported as
specified in subclause 6.1.4.1, the UE shall enter sub states
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and 5GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and
initiate a tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]).

\[TS 24.301, subclause 4.4.2.3\]

During Inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, if
the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and:

1\) if the tracking area updating procedure is initiated as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], the UE shall transmit a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message integrity protected with the current 5G NAS security
context and the UE shall derive a mapped EPS security context (see
subclause 8.6.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 \[56\]). The UE shall include the eKSI
indicating the 5G NAS security context value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.

After receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including the
eKSI, the MME forwards the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the
source AMF, if possible, to obtain the mapped EPS security context from
the AMF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[56\]. The MME re-establishes
the secure exchange of NAS messages by either:

\- replying with a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that is integrity
protected and ciphered using the mapped EPS NAS security context. From
this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in
subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent ciphered; or

##### 9.3.1.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-94 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclauses 4.4.2.1, 4.4.2.5, 5.1.4.2,
5.5.1.3.2; TS 24.301 \[21\], subclause 5.5.5. Unless otherwise stated
these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.4.2.1\]

Before security can be activated, the AMF and the UE need to establish a
5G NAS security context. Usually, the 5G NAS security context is created
as the result of a primary authentication and key agreement procedure
between the AMF and the UE. A new 5G NAS security context may also be
created during an N1 mode to N1 mode handover. Alternatively, during
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the AMF not supporting
interworking without N26 and the UE operating in single-registration
mode may derive a mapped 5G NAS security context from an EPS security
context that has been established while the UE was in S1 mode.

\...

The key set identifier ngKSI is assigned by the AMF either during the
primary authentication and key agreement procedure or, for the mapped 5G
NAS security context, during the inter-system change. The ngKSI consists
of a value and a type of security context parameter indicating whether a
5G NAS security context is a native 5G NAS security context or a mapped
5G NAS security context. When the 5G NAS security context is a native 5G
NAS security context, the ngKSI has the value of KSI~AMF~, and when the
current 5G NAS security context is of type mapped, the ngKSI has the
value of KSI~ASME~.

The 5G NAS security context which is indicated by an ngKSI can be taken
into use to establish the secure exchange of NAS messages when a new N1
NAS signalling connection is established without executing a new primary
authentication and key agreement procedure (see subclause 5.4.1) or when
the AMF initiates a security mode control procedure. For this purpose,
the initial NAS messages (i.e. REGISTRATION REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST) and the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contain an ngKSI in the NAS key set
identifier IE indicating the current 5G NAS security context used to
integrity protect the NAS message.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.4.2.5\]

Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is
usually established by the AMF during the registration procedure by
initiating a security mode control procedure. After successful
completion of the security mode control procedure, all NAS messages
exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected using
the current 5G security algorithms, and except for the messages
specified in subclause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE
and the AMF are sent ciphered using the current 5G security algorithms.

\...

During inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, if
the UE is operating in single-registration mode and:

...b) if the UE has no valid native 5G NAS security context, the UE
shall send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without integrity protection
and encryption.

After receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without integrity
protection and encryption:

1\) if N26 interface is supported:

i\) if an EPS security context received from the source MME does not
include the NAS security algorithms set to EIA0 and EEA0, the AMF shall
either create a fresh mapped 5G NAS security context (see
subclause 8.6.2 of 3GPP TS 33.501 \[24\]) or trigger a primary
authentication and key agreement procedure to create a fresh native 5G
NAS security context; or

\...

The newly created 5G NAS security context is taken into use by
initiating a security mode control procedure and this context becomes
the current 5G NAS security context in both the UE and the AMF. This
re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.1.4.2\]

At inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE shall enter sub
states 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and initiate a registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update indicating \"mobility
registration updating\" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see subclause 5.5.1.3).

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.3.2\]

The UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the registration
procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by sending a
REGISTRATION REQUEST message to the AMF,

\...

e\) upon Inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode;

\...

If case b) is the only reason for initiating the registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration update, the UE shall indicate
\"periodic registration updating\" in the 5GS registration type IE;
otherwise the UE shall indicate \"mobility registration updating\".

If the UE indicates \"mobility registration updating\" in the 5GS
registration type IE and the UE supports S1 mode, the UE shall:

\- set the S1 mode bit to \"S1 mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message;

\- include the S1 UE network capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message; and

\- if the UE supports sending an ATTACH REQUEST message containing a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover\" to
transfer a PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode, set the HO attach bit to
\"attach request message containing PDN connectivity request with
request type set to handover to transfer PDU session from N1 mode to S1
mode supported\" in the 5GMM capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.

\...

If the last visited registered TAI is available, the UE shall include
the last visited registered TAI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

The UE shall handle the 5GS mobility identity IE in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message as follows:

a\) if the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, performs
Inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, and the UE holds a valid
4G-GUTI, the UE shall include the 5G-GUTI mapped from the 4G-GUTI as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[4\] in the 5GS mobility identity IE.
Additionally, if the UE holds a valid 5G‑GUTI, the UE shall include the
5G-GUTI in the Additional GUTI IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message in
the following order:

1\) a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned by the same PLMN with
which the UE is performing the registration, if available;

2\) a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned by an equivalent PLMN,
if available; and

3\) a valid 5G-GUTI that was previously assigned by any other PLMN, if
available; and

\...

If the UE operating in the single-registration mode performs
Inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE:

a\) shall include the UE status IE with the EMM registration status set
to \"UE is in EMM-REGISTERED state\" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message;

NOTE 1: Inclusion of the UE status IE with this setting corresponds to
the indication that the UE is \"moving from EPC\" as specified in
3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\], subclause 4.11.1.3.3 and 4.11.2.3.

b\) may include the PDU session status IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message indicating the status of the PDU session(s) mapped during the
Inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode from the PDN connection(s)
for which the EPS indicated that interworking to 5GS is supported, if
any (see subclause 6.1.4.1); and

c\) shall include a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] in the IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.

\...

The UE shall send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message including the NAS
message container IE as described in subclause 4.4.6:

\...

b\) when the UE is sending the message after an Inter-system change from
S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode and the UE has a valid 5G NAS
security context and needs to send non-cleartext IEs.

\[TS 24.301, subclause 5.5.5\]

The tracking area updating procedure is used to construct a TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message for the inter-system change from S1 mode to
N1 mode for further security verification by the MME.

The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is created by EMM by request of
5GMM which further includes the message in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message as described in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\].

The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall contain only mandatory
information elements.

The UE shall set the EPS update type IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message to \"TA updating\".

If the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall include the
eKSI (either KSI~ASME~ or KSI~SGSN~) in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. Otherwise, the UE shall set
the NAS Key Set Identifier IE to the value \"no key is available\". If
the UE has a current EPS security context, the UE shall integrity
protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the current EPS
security context and increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one. Otherwise the
UE shall not integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.
The UE shall set associated GUTI in the Old GUTI IE.

When the UE is in EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE substate and needs to
construct the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message for inter-system
change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE shall consider that the tracking
area updating procedure is not initiated and the UE shall remain in
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE state.

\- With NGC Cell A \"Serving cell\" and E-UTRA Cell A \"Non-suitable
\"Off\" cell\", the UE is switched on and when it initiates the initial
registration procedure then it is rejected as specified in subclause
4.9.8 Procedure for Registration Reject. This is made to ensure that the
UE does not have a valid native 5G NAS security context for the rest of
the test case.

\- the UE is switched-off.

\- With E-UTRA Cell A \"Serving cell\" and NGC Cell A \"Non-suitable
\"Off\" cell\", the UE is brought to state RRC\_IDLE using generic
procedure parameters Connectivity (*E-UTRA/EPC*) and Unrestricted nr PDN
(*On*)in accordance with the procedure described in TS 38.508-1 \[4\],
clause 4.5.2. 4G GUTI and eKSI are assigned and security context
established.

##### (1) {#section-232 .H6}

**with** { UE in state 5GMM-REGISTERED on an NGC cell, UE supporting S1
and N1 and operating in single-registration mode, NWK supporting
Single-registration mode with N26 interface }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE initiates a Mobility and periodic registration procedure
on an NGC cell and receives a REGISTRATION REJECT message including 5GMM
cause value \#9 (UE identity cannot be derived by the network) }

**then** { UE deletes the EPS relevant parameters 4G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI and eKSI and enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED, and,
subsequently, when it finds a suitable E-UTRA cell it moves to it and
automatically initiates an attach procedure }

##### 9.3.1.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-95 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclause 5.5.1.3.5, TS 24.301 \[21\],
clause 5.5.3.2.5. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 5.5.1.3.5\]

If the mobility and periodic registration update request cannot be
accepted by the network, the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT
message to the UE including an appropriate 5GMM cause value.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the 5GMM cause
value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\...

\#9 (UE identity cannot be derived by the network).

\...

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the EMM parameters EMM state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]
for the case when the normal tracking area updating procedure is
rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

\[TS 24.301, subclause 5.5.3.2.5\]

If the tracking area updating cannot be accepted by the network, the MME
sends a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate EMM cause value.

\...

\#9 (UE identity cannot be derived by the network);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED (and shall
store it according to subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last
visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services, the UE shall subsequently, automatically
initiate the attach procedure.

##### 9.3.1.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-96 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 \[22\], subclauses 4.6.1 and 4.6.2.2. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.6.1\]

The 5GS supports network slicing as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\].
Within a PLMN or SNPN, a network slice is identified by an S-NSSAI,
which is comprised of a slice/service type (SST) and a slice
differentiator (SD). Inclusion of an SD in an S-NSSAI is optional. A set
of one or more S-NSSAIs is called the NSSAI. The following NSSAIs are
defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]:

a\) configured NSSAI;

b\) requested NSSAI;

c\) allowed NSSAI;

d\) subscribed S-NSSAIs; and

e\) pending NSSAI.

The following NSSAIs are defined in the present document:

a\) rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN;

b\) rejected NSSAI for the current registration area;

c\) rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA; and

d\) rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached.

...

The rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is applicable
for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN. The AMF shall send a rejected
NSSAI including S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not
available due to maximum number of UEs reached\", when one or more
S-NSSAIs are indicated that **the maximum number of UEs has been
reached. If the timer T3526 associated with the** S-NSSAI(s) **was
started upon reception of the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of
UEs reached, the UE may** remove the S-NSSAI(s) from the rejected NSSAI
including S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause \"S-NSSAI not available
due to maximum number of UEs reached\", if the timer **T3526 associated
with the** S-NSSAI(s) expires. If one or more S-NSSAIs are removed from
the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, the timer
T3526 associated with the removed S-NSSAI(s) shall be stopped, if
running. The UE shall not stop the timer T3526 if the UE selects an
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC.

\[TS 24.501, subclause 4.6.2.2\]

If available, the configured NSSAI(s) shall be stored in a non-volatile
memory in the ME as specified in annex C. For a configured NSSAI, if
there is associated NSSRG information, the NSSRG information shall also
be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex C.
The support for NSSRG information by a UE or an AMF is optional.

The allowed NSSAI(s) should be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME
as specified in annex C.

Each of the configured NSSAI stored in the UE is a set composed of at
most 16 S-NSSAIs. Each of the allowed NSSAI stored in the UE is a set
composed of at most 8 S-NSSAIs and is associated with a PLMN identity or
SNPN identity, an access type and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. Each of
the configured NSSAI except the default configured NSSAI, and the
rejected NSSAI is associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and,
if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. Each of the pending NSSAI
stored in the UE is a set composed of at most 16 S-NSSAIs and is
associated with a PLMN identity or SNPN identity and, if the UE supports
access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, the
selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription. The S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the current
registration area are further associated with one or more tracking areas
where the rejected S-NSSAI(s) is not available. The S-NSSAI(s) in the
rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN shall be considered rejected
for the current PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type. The
S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA shall
be considered rejected for the current PLMN regardless of the access
type. The S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs
reached are further associated with the access type over which the
rejected NSSAI was received. There shall be no duplicated PLMN
identities or SNPN identities associated with each of the list of
configured NSSAI(s), pending NSSAI(s), rejected NSSAI(s) for the current
PLMN or SNPN, rejected NSSAI(s) for the current registration area,
rejected NSSAI(s) for the failed or revoked NSSAA, and rejected NSSAI
for the maximum number of UEs reached.

The UE stores NSSAIs as follows:

...

c\) When the UE receives the S-NSSAI(s) included in the rejected NSSAI
in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, the REGISTRATION REJECT message, the
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
message, the UE shall:

1\) store the S-NSSAI(s) into the rejected NSSAI and the mapped
S-NSSAI(s) for the rejected NSSAI based on the associated rejection
cause(s);

\...

When the UE receive ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
provided with S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID in the protocol configuration
options IE or extended protocol configuration options IE (see
subclause 6.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]), the UE shall remove the
S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN. When the UE
receive ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message provided
with S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID in the protocol configuration options IE or
extended protocol configuration options IE (see subclause 6.2.2 of
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]), the UE may remove the S-NSSAI from the rejected
NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached for each and every access
type, if any, and stop the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI if
running.

When the UE:

1\) deregisters over an access type;

2\) successfully registers in a new registration area over an access
type;

3\) enters state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED or 5GMM-REGISTERED following an
unsuccessful registration in a new registration area over an access
type; or

4\) performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE
successfully completes tracking area update procedure;

the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area corresponding to
the access type shall be deleted;

**with** { UE supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode and is switched on
without NG-RAN coverage but with very poor E-UTRA coverage }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE moves back to NG-RAN coverage after having attach attempt
counter is equal to 5 }

**then** { UE shall not disable the E-UTRA capability }

}

##### 9.3.1.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-97 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.301, clauses 4.5 and 5.5.1.2.6, TS 23.502, clause
4.13.6.1 and TS 38.331, clause 5.3.8.3. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.301, clause 4.5\]

The UE shall only disable the E-UTRA capability when in EMM-IDLE mode.

When the UE supports both N1 mode and S1 mode then the UE\'s capability
to access the 5GCN via E-UTRA shall not be affected, if the UE\'s E-UTRA
capability is disabled or enabled.

When the UE is disabling the E-UTRA capability not due to redirection to
5GCN required, it should proceed as follows:

a\) select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not
disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\]) of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs;

b\) if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the UE does not have a registered
PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 \[6\].
As an implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the
UE may select another RAT of the chosen PLMN. If disabling of E-UTRA
capability was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services
only, the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability for this PLMN
selection; or

c\) if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then
the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability and remain registered for EPS
services in E-UTRAN of the registered PLMN. If the UE chooses this
option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT
combination that can provide non-EPS services. How this periodic
scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.

...

As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling
E-UTRA when the UE\'s attach attempt counter or tracking area updating
attempt counter reaches 5 and the UE disables E-UTRA capability for
cases described in clauses 5.5.1.2.6, 5.5.1.3.4.3, 5.5.1.3.6, 5.5.3.2.6,
5.5.3.3.4.3 and 5.5.3.3.6. The UE should memorize the identity of the
PLMNs where E-UTRA capability were disabled. On expiry of this timer:

\- if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and is in idle mode as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[13\] on expiry of the timer, the UE should enable
the E-UTRA capability;

\- if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and an RR connection exists, the
UE shall delay enabling E-UTRA capability until the RR connection is
released;

\- if the UE is in Iu mode and a PS signalling connection exists but no
RR connection exists, the UE may abort the PS signalling connection
before enabling E-UTRA capability;

\- if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], on expiry of the timer, the UE should enable the
E-UTRA capability; and

\- if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], on expiry of the timer, the UE shall delay
enabling the E-UTRA capability until the N1 NAS signalling connection is
released.

If the UE attempts to establish an emergency bearer service or to access
RLOS in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE\'s
attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter have
reached 5, the UE may enable the E-UTRA capability for that PLMN
memorized by the UE.

The UE may support being configured for No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS (see
3GPP TS 24.368 \[50\] or 3GPP TS 31.102 \[17\]). If the UE supports
being configured for No E-UTRA Disabling in 5GS, No E-UTRA Disabling In
5GS is enabled if the corresponding configuration parameter is present
and set to enabled. Otherwise, No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is disabled.
If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE and the UE selects an
NG-RAN cell in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to
the UE\'s attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt
counter having reached 5, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability for
that PLMN.

For other cases, it is up to the UE implementation when to enable the
E-UTRA capability.

> NOTE: If the UE is not operating in CS/PS mode 1 operation, the value
> of the timer for enabling E-UTRA capability is recommended to be not
> larger than the default value of T3402.

\[TS 24.301, clause 5.5.1.2.6\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

...

> c\) T3410 timeout
>
> The UE shall abort the attach procedure. The NAS signalling
> connection, if any, shall be released locally.
>
> NOTE 2: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE
> deems that the network has failed the authentication check as
> specified in clause 5.4.2.7.
>
> The UE shall proceed as described below.

...

For the cases b, c, d, l, la and m:

> \- Timer T3410 shall be stopped if still running.
>
> \- For the cases b, c, d, l when the \"Extended wait time\" is
> ignored, and la when the \"Extended wait time CP data\" is ignored, if
> the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for

> type not set to \"EPS emergency attach\", the attach attempt counter
> shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5.
>
> \- If the attach attempt counter is less than 5:
>

\[TS 23.502, clause 4.13.6.1\]

Figure 4.13.6.1-1 describes the EPS fallback procedure for IMS voice.

When the UE is served by the 5G System, the UE has one or more ongoing
PDU Sessions each including one or more QoS Flows. The serving PLMN AMF
has sent an indication towards the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported, see clause 5.16.3.10 of
TS 23.501 \[2\] and the UE has registered in the IMS. If N26 is not
supported, the serving PLMN AMF sends an indication towards the UE
during the Registration procedure that interworking without N26 is
supported, see clause 5.17.2.3.1 of TS 23.501 \[2\].

Figure 4.13.6.1-1: EPS Fallback for IMS voice

1\. UE camps on NG-RAN in the 5GS and an MO or MT IMS voice session
establishment has been initiated.

2\. Network initiated PDU Session modification to setup QoS flow for
voice reaches the NG-RAN (see N2 PDU Session Request in clause 4.3.3).

3\. NG-RAN is configured to support EPS fallback for IMS voice and
decides to trigger fallback to EPS, taking into account UE capabilities,
indication from AMF that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for voice is
possible\" (received as part of initial context setup, handover resource
allocation or path switch request acknowledge as defined in
TS 38.413 \[10\]), network configuration (e.g. N26 availability
configuration) and radio conditions. If NG-RAN decides not to trigger
fallback to EPS, then the procedure stops here and following steps are
not executed.

NG-RAN may initiate measurement report solicitation from the UE
including E-UTRAN as target.

NOTE 1: If AMF has indicated that \"Redirection for EPS fallback for
voice is not possible\", then EPS fallback for IMS voice is not
performed in step 5. If NG-RAN has not received indication \"Redirection
for EPS fallback for voice\", the decision to execute EPS fallback for
IMS voice or not is based on network configuration (e.g. based on N26
availability and other criteria).

4\. NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the PDU Session modification
to setup QoS flow for IMS voice received in step 2 by PDU Session
Modification Response message towards the SMF+PGW-C (or H-SMF+P-GW-C via
V-SMF, in the case of home routed roaming scenario) via AMF with an
indication that mobility due to fallback for IMS voice is ongoing. The
SMF+PGW-C maintains the PCC rule(s) associated with the QoS Flow(s) and
reports the EPS Fallback event to the PCF if PCF has subscribed to this
event.

5\. NG-RAN initiates either handover (see clause 4.11.1.2.1), or AN
Release via inter-system redirection to EPS (see clause 4.2.6 and clause
4.11.1.3.2), taking into account UE capabilities. The SMF+PGW-C reports
change of the RAT type if subscribed by PCF as specified in clause
4.11.1.2.1, or clause 4.11.1.3.2.6. When the UE is connected to EPS,
either 6a or 6b is executed

6a. In the case of 5GS to EPS handover, see clause 4.11.1.2.1 and in the
case of inter-system redirection to EPS with N26 interface, see
clause 4.11.1.3.2. In either case the UE initiates TAU procedure and the
UE includes active flag in the request in the case of inter-system
redirection to EPS; or

6b. In the case of inter-system redirection to EPS without N26
interface, see clause 4.11.2.2. If the UE supports Request Type flag
\"handover\" for PDN connectivity request during the attach procedure as
described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 \[13\] and has received the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported, then the UE
initiates Attach with PDN connectivity request with request type
\"handover\".

In the case of inter-system redirection for the emergency service, the
UE uses the emergency indication in the RRC message as specified in
clause 6.2.2 of TS 36.331 \[16\] and E-UTRAN provides the emergency
indication to MME during Tracking Area Update or Attach procedure. For
the handover procedure see clause 4.11.1.2.1, step 1.

7\. After completion of the mobility procedure to EPS or as part of the
5GS to EPS handover procedure, the SMF+PGW-C re-initiates the setup of
the dedicated bearer(s) for the maintained PCC rule(s) in step 4
including of the dedicated bearer for IMS voice, mapping the 5G QoS to
EPC QoS parameters as specified in clause 4.11.1.2.1. The SMF+PGW-C
reports about Successful Resource Allocation and Access Network
Information if subscribed by PCF.

The IMS signalling related to IMS voice call establishment continues
after step 1 as specified in the TS 23.228 \[55\].

At least for the duration of the voice call in EPS the E-UTRAN is
configured to not trigger any handover to 5GS.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.3.8.3\]

The UE shall:

capability was disabled due to the tracking area updating attempt
counter is equal to 5 and then UE moves back to a good coverage with NR
network }

**then** { UE enables the E-UTRA capability }

##### 9.3.1.6.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-98 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.301, clauses 4.5 and 5.5.1.3.6, TS 23.502, clause
4.13.6.1 and TS 38.331, clause 5.3.8.3. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.301, clause 4.5\]

The UE shall only disable the E-UTRA capability when in EMM-IDLE mode.

When the UE supports both N1 mode and S1 mode then the UE\'s capability
to access the 5GCN via E-UTRA shall not be affected, if the UE\'s E-UTRA
capability is disabled or enabled.

When the UE is disabling the E-UTRA capability not due to redirection to
5GCN required, it should proceed as follows:

a\) select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not
disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\]) of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs;

b\) if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the UE does not have a registered
PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 \[6\].
As an implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the
UE may select another RAT of the chosen PLMN. If disabling of E-UTRA
capability was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services
only, the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability for this PLMN
selection; or

c\) if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then
the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability and remain registered for EPS
services in E-UTRAN of the registered PLMN. If the UE chooses this
option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT
combination that can provide non-EPS services. How this periodic
scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.

...

As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling
E-UTRA when the UE\'s attach attempt counter or tracking area updating
attempt counter reaches 5 and the UE disables E-UTRA capability for
cases described in clauses 5.5.1.2.6, 5.5.1.3.4.3, 5.5.1.3.6, 5.5.3.2.6,
5.5.3.3.4.3 and 5.5.3.3.6. The UE should memorize the identity of the
PLMNs where E-UTRA capability were disabled. On expiry of this timer:

\- if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and is in idle mode as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[13\] on expiry of the timer, the UE should enable
the E-UTRA capability;

\- if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and an RR connection exists, the
UE shall delay enabling E-UTRA capability until the RR connection is
released;

\- if the UE is in Iu mode and a PS signalling connection exists but no
RR connection exists, the UE may abort the PS signalling connection
before enabling E-UTRA capability;

\- if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], on expiry of the timer, the UE should enable the
E-UTRA capability; and

\- if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[54\], on expiry of the timer, the UE shall delay
enabling the E-UTRA capability until the N1 NAS signalling connection is
released.

If the UE attempts to establish an emergency bearer service or to access
RLOS in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE\'s
attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter have
reached 5, the UE may enable the E-UTRA capability for that PLMN
memorized by the UE.

The UE may support being configured for No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS (see
3GPP TS 24.368 \[50\] or 3GPP TS 31.102 \[17\]). If the UE supports
being configured for No E-UTRA Disabling in 5GS, No E-UTRA Disabling In
5GS is enabled if the corresponding configuration parameter is present
and set to enabled. Otherwise, No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is disabled.
If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE and the UE selects an
NG-RAN cell in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to
the UE\'s attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt
counter having reached 5, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability for
that PLMN.

For other cases, it is up to the UE implementation when to enable the
E-UTRA capability.

> NOTE: If the UE is not operating in CS/PS mode 1 operation, the value
> of the timer for enabling E-UTRA capability is recommended to be not
> larger than the default value of T3402.

\[TS 24.301, clause 5.5.1.3.6\]

The UE shall proceed as follows:

...

2\) if the combined attach was successful for EPS services only and the
ATTACH ACCEPT message contained an EMM cause value not treated in clause
5.5.1.3.4.3 or the EMM cause IE is not included in the message, the UE
shall proceed as follows:

a\) The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, and shall enter
state MM IDLE. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be
incremented, unless it was already set to 5;

b\) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

\- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to
EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3411 expires the
combined tracking area updating procedure indicating \"combined TA/LA
updating with IMSI attach\" is triggered;

c\) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

\- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in
CS/PS mode 1 of operation with \"IMS voice available\" shall start timer
T3402 if the value of the timer as indicated by the network is not zero,
shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM.

\- If the value of T3402 as indicated by the network is zero, the UE
shall perform the actions defined for the expiry of the timer T3402.

\- When timer T3402 expires the combined tracking area updating
procedure indicating \"combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach\" is
triggered; and

\- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with \"IMS voice not
available\" shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology and proceed with appropriate MM, GMM or 5GMM specific
procedures. If the UE selects GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology,
the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5). If No E-UTRA
Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE (see 3GPP TS 24.368 \[50\] or 3GPP
TS 31.102 \[17\]) and the UE selects NG-RAN radio access technology, it
shall not disable the E-UTRA capability; otherwise, the UE may disable
the E-UTRA capability as specified in clause 4.5; and

NOTE 2: Whether the UE requests RRC to treat the active E-UTRA cell as
barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 \[21\]) is left to the UE implementation.

d\) If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call
pending, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then
proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise
the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the EMM procedure to the MM
sublayer; and

3\) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6 apply
with the following modification.

If the attach attempt counter is incremented according to clause
5.5.1.2.6 the next actions depend on the value of the attach attempt
counter:

\- if the attach attempt counter is less than 5, the UE shall set the
update status to U2 NOT UPDATED but shall not delete any LAI, TMSI,
ciphering key sequence number and list of equivalent PLMNs; or

\- if the attach attempt counter is equal to 5, then the UE shall delete
any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number and list of equivalent
PLMNs and set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

\- The UE shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology and proceed with appropriate MM, GMM or 5GMM specific
procedures. Additionally, if the UE selects GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in
clause 4.5. If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE (see 3GPP
TS 24.368 \[50\] or 3GPP TS 31.102 \[17\]) and the UE selects NG-RAN
radio access technology, it shall not disable the E-UTRA capability;
otherwise, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in
clause 4.5.

NOTE 3: Whether the UE requests RRC to treat the active E-UTRA cell as
barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 \[21\]) is left to the UE implementation.

If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call
pending, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then
proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise
the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the EMM procedure to the MM
sublayer.

##### 9.4.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-99 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 23.122 clause 3.1, TS 24.501 clauses 4.23.2, 5.5.1.2.5
and 5.1.3.2.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 23.122 clause 3.1\]

To prevent repeated attempts to obtain service on a PLMN through
satellite NG-RAN or satellite E-UTRAN access technology, when the MS
receives an integrity protected reject message with cause value \#78
\"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" from a
satellite NG-RAN cell or a satellite E-UTRAN cell, the MS maintains a
list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" in
which it stores the PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN, the current
geographical location, if known by the MS. A timer is started when the
PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN is added to the list of \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\". If the geographical
location exists, a MS implementation specific distance value needs to be
stored. An entry in the list is deleted if the timer associated to the
entry expires or the MS successfully registers to the PLMN stored in the
entry. An entry in the list may be deleted if the current UE location is
known, a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and
the distance to the current UE location is larger than a UE
implementation specific value. For details see 3GPP TS 24.501 \[64\] and
3GPP TS 24.301 \[23A\].

NOTE 1: The list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE
location\" is provided to the AS, see 3GPP TS 38.304 \[61\].

In automatic PLMN selection mode, if the MS detects a PLMN in satellite
NG-RAN access technology which is part of the list of \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\" the MS shall consider
the PLMN as PLMN selection candidate for satellite NG-RAN access
technology only if the current MS location is known, a geographical
location is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance to the
current MS location is larger than a MS implementation specific value.

\[TS 24.501, clause 4.23.2\]

For 3GPP satellite NG-RAN the UE shall store a list of \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\". Each entry consists of:

a\) the PLMN identity of the PLMN which sent a message including 5GMM
cause value \#78 \"PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE
location\" via satellite NG-RAN access technology; and

b\) the geographical location, if known by the UE, where 5GMM cause
value \#78 was received on satellite NG-RAN access technology; and

c\) if the geographical location exists, a UE implementation specific
distance value.

Before storing a new entry in the list, the UE shall delete any existing
entry with the same PLMN identity. Upon storing a new entry, the UE
starts a timer instance associated with the entry with an implementation
specific value that shall not be set to a value smaller than the timer
value indicated by the network in the Lower bound timer value IE, if
any. If the Lower bound timer value IE was not provided by the network,
the value of the timer shall be set based on the UE implementation.

The UE is allowed to attempt to access a PLMN via satellite NG-RAN
access technology which is part of the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to
operate at the present UE location\" only if:

a\) the current UE location is known, a geographical location is stored
for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance to the current UE location
is larger than a UE implementation specific value.

b\) the timer associated with the entry of this PLMN has expired; or

c\) the access is for emergency services (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\] for
further details).

NOTE: When the UE is accessing network for emergency services, it is up
to operator and regulatory policies whether the network needs to
determine if the UE is in a location where network is not allowed to
operate.

The list shall accommodate three or more entries. The maximum number of
entries is an implementation decision. When the list is full and a new
entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted.

Each entry shall be removed if for the entry:

a\) the UE successfully registers via satellite NG-RAN access technology
to the PLMN stored in the entry except when the UE registers for
emergency services; or

b\) the timer instance associated with the entry expires.

The UE may delete the entry in the list, if the current UE location is
known, a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and
the distance to the current UE location is larger than a UE
implementation specific value.

If the UE is in 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state and an entry
from the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE
location\" is removed, the UE shall perform PLMN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

When the UE is switched off, the UE shall keep the list of \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\" in its non-volatile
memory. The UE shall delete the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate
at the present UE location\" if the USIM is removed.

If the UE is switched off when the timer instance associated with the
entry in the list is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE
is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same:

let t1 be the time remaining for timer instance associated with the
entry in the list to timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed
between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the
timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1 is equal to or
less than t, then the timer need not be restarted and considered
expired. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall
restart the timer with the value t1.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

...

If the REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause \#76 or \#78 was
received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the
message. If the REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause \#62 was
received without integrity protected, the behaviour of the UE is
specified in subclause 5.3.20.2.

Based on operator policy, if the initial registration request is
rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the
network shall set the 5GMM cause value to \#31 \"Redirection to EPC
required\".

NOTE 1: The network can take into account the UE\'s S1 mode capability,
the EPS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the EPS CIoT
network behaviour supported by the EPC to determine the rejection with
the 5GMM cause value \#31 \"Redirection to EPC required\".

...

If the UE\'s initial registration request is via a satellite NG-RAN cell
and the network using the User Location Information provided by the
NG-RAN, see 3GPP TS 38.413 \[31\], is able to determine that the UE is
in a location where the network is not allowed to operate, the network
shall set the 5GMM cause value in the REGISTRATION REJECT message to
\#78 \"PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location\".

NOTE 5: When the UE is accessing network for emergency services, it is
up to operator and regulatory policies whether the network needs to
determine if the UE is in a location where network is not allowed to
operate.

...

If the AMF received multiple TAIs from the satellite NG-RAN as described
in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], and determines that, by UE subscription and
operator\'s preferences, all of the received TAIs are forbidden for
roaming or for regional provision of service, the AMF shall include the
TAI(s) in:

a\) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas
for roaming\" IE; or

b\) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas
for regional provision of service\" IE; or

c\) both;

in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

Regardless of the 5GMM cause value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT
message via satellite NG-RAN,

\- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT
message and if the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of
\"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", the UE shall store the
TAI(s) included in the IE, if not already stored, into the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for roaming\"; and

\- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE in the
REGISTRATION REJECT message and if the TAI(s) included in the IE is not
part of the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the
IE, if not already stored, into the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\".

Furthermore, the UE shall take the following actions depending on the
5GMM cause value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

...

\#78 (PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location).

This cause value received from a non-satellite NG-RAN cell is considered
as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally,
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter. The UE shall store
the PLMN identity and, if it is known, the current geographical location
in the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE
location\" and shall start a corresponding timer instance (see
subclause 4.23.2). The UE shall enter state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform a PLMN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\].

If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall handle the EMM parameters EMM
state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, TAI list, eKSI and attach attempt
counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the case when the EPS
attach procedure is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

...

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.1.3.2.2\]

In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour, the 5GS update (5U)
status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.

If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode (see
3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\]), the 5GS update status is stored in a non-volatile
memory in the USIM if the corresponding file is present in the USIM,
else in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in annex C.

If the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode, the 5GS update
status for each SNPN whose SNPN identity is included in the \"list of
subscriber data\" configured in the ME (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[5\]) is
stored in the non-volatile memory in the ME as described in annex C.

The 5GS update status value is changed only after the execution of a
registration, network-initiated de-registration, 5GS based primary
authentication and key agreement, service request, paging procedure or
due to change in the current TAI which does not belong to the current
registration area while T3346 is running.

...

5U3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

The last registration, service request, or registration for mobility or
periodic registration update attempt was correctly performed, but the
answer from the AMF was negative (because of roaming or subscription
restrictions).

##### 9.4.1.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-100 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 23.501 clauses 5.4.11.6, TS 24.501 clause 5.3.4, TS
38.331 clause 5.2.2.4.1 and 5.2.2.4.2.

Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[23.501, clause 5.4.11.6\]

A moving radio cell for NR satellite access may indicate support for one
or more TACs for each PLMN. A UE that is registered with a PLMN may
access a radio cell and does not need to perform a Mobility Registration
Update procedure as long as at least one supported TAC for the RPLMN or
equivalent to the RPLMN is part of the UE Registration Area. A UE shall
perform a Mobility Registration Update procedure when accessing a radio
cell where none of the supported TACs for the RPLMN or equivalent to the
RPLMN are part of the UE Registration Area.

When indicating a last visited TAI in a Registration Update, a UE may
indicate any TAI supported in a radio cell for the RPLMN or equivalent
to the RPLMN for the last UE access prior to the Registration Update
that is part of the UE Registration Area.

\[24.501, clause 5.3.4\]

...

c)   The UE considers itself registered to a list of tracking areas and
does not need to trigger the registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update used for mobility (i.e. the 5GS
registration type IE set to \"mobility registration updating\" in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message) as long as the UE stays in one of the
tracking areas of the list of tracking areas received from the AMF.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.2.2.4.1\]

Upon receiving the *MIB* the UE shall:

1\> store the acquired *MIB*;

1\> if the UE is in RRC\_IDLE or in RRC\_INACTIVE, or if the UE is in
RRC\_CONNECTED while *T311* is running:

2\> if the access is not for NTN or the UE is not capable of NTN; and

2\> if the *cellBarred* in the acquired *MIB* is set to *barred*:

...

3\> consider the cell as barred in accordance with TS 38.304 \[20\];

3\> perform cell re-selection to other cells on the same frequency as
the barred cell as specified in TS 38.304 \[20\]*;*

2\> else:

3\> apply the received *systemFrameNumber*, *pdcch-ConfigSIB1*,
*subCarrierSpacingCommon*, *ssb-SubcarrierOffset* and
*dmrs-TypeA-Position*.

NOTE: A UE capable of NTN access should acquire SIB1 to determine
whether the cell is an NTN cell.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.2.2.4.2\]

Upon receiving the SIB1 the UE shall:

1\> store the acquired *SIB1*;

1\> if the access is for NTN, and the *cellBarredNTN* in the acquired
*SIB1* is set to *barred* or the *cellBarredNTN* is not included in the
acquired *SIB1*:

2\> consider the cell as barred in accordance with TS 38.304 \[20\];

2\> perform cell re-selection to other cells on the same frequency as
the barred cell as specified in TS 38.304 \[20\]*;*

....

1\> if the *cellAccessRelatedInfo* contains an entry of a selected SNPN
or PLMN and in case of PLMN the UE is either allowed or instructed to
access the PLMN via a cell for which at least one CAG ID is broadcast:

2\> in the remainder of the procedures use *npn-IdentityList,
trackingAreaCode, and cellIdentity for the cell as received in the
corresponding entry of npn-IdentityInfoList containing the selected PLMN
or SNPN;*

1\> else if the *cellAccessRelatedInfo* contains an entry with the
*PLMN-Identity* of the selected PLMN:

2\> in the remainder of the procedures use *plmn-IdentityList*,
*trackingAreaCode*, *trackingAreaList,* and *cellIdentity* for the cell
as received in the corresponding *PLMN-IdentityInfo* containing the
selected PLMN;

...

1\> else:

...

3\> else:

...

4\> forward the *cellIdentity* to upper layers;

4\> forward the *trackingAreaCode* to upper layers;

4\> forward the *trackingAreaList* to upper layers, if included;

##### 9.4.1.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-101 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501 clause 4.23.5 and TS23.501 clauses 5.4.11.8

Handling of the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and
the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service\" is specified in clause 5.3.13.

Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[24.501, clause 4.23.5\]

When a UE camps on a satellite NG-RAN cell, the UE may receive multiple
TACs from the lower layers. The UE shall construct TAIs from the
multiple TACs (i.e. concatenate the identity of the current PLMN and
each of the TACs) and select a TAI as follows:

a\) if at least one TAI belongs to the current registration area of the
UE, the UE shall select a TAI which belongs to the current registration
area of the UE according to the followings.

If there are multiple TAIs which belong to the current registration area
of the UE, the UE shall select a TAI as follows:

1\) if there is a TAI which belongs to the list of \"allowed tracking
area\" (if any) and does not belong to the list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\" (if any), the UE shall select a TAI which belongs to
the list of \"allowed tracking area\" (if any) and does not belong to
the list of \"non-allowed tracking areas\" (if any). In this case, if
there are multiple TAIs which belong to the list of \"allowed tracking
area\" (if any) and does not belong to the list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\" (if any), then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs
equal and select a TAI in an implementation-specific way (e.g. taking
into account LADN service area information). [If these multiple TAIs
contain the previous current TAI, the current TAI can be left
unchanged.]{.underline}

2\) if there is no TAI which belongs to the list of \"allowed tracking
area\" (if any) and does not belong to the list of \"non-allowed
tracking areas\" (if any) or neither the list of \"allowed tracking
area\" nor the list of \"non-allowed tracking areas\" is available, then
the UE shall consider each of these TAIs equal and select a TAI in an
implementation-specific way (e.g. taking into account LADN service area
information). [If these multiple TAIs contain the previous current TAI,
the current TAI can be left unchanged.]{.underline}

\...

b\) if no TAI belongs to the current registration area of the UE and:

1\) there is a TAI which belongs to neither the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\" nor the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\", the UE shall select a TAI
which belongs to neither the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\" nor the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\". In this case, if there are multiple TAIs which
belong to neither the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\" nor the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs
equal and select a TAI in an implementation-specific way.

2\) all TAIs belong to the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\" or the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs
equal and select a TAI in an implementation-specific way.

The UE shall consider the selected TAI as the current TAI. The UE shall
select a TAI when:

a\) the UE receives multiple TACs from the lower layers; or

b\) the UE has received multiple TACs from the lower layers upon
starting to camping on the current cell and the registration area, the
list of \"allowed tracking areas\", the list of \"non-allowed tracking
areas\", the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", or
the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service\" is updated.

Handling of the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and
the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service\" is specified in clause 5.3.13.

\[24.501, clause 5.3.13\]

If the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode, the UE shall
store a list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", as well as
a list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service\". Otherwise the UE shall store a list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\":

\...

Within the 5GS, these lists are managed independently per access type,
i.e., 3GPP access or wireline access. These lists shall be erased when:

a\) the UE is switched off, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, an
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the subscribed SNPN
identity identifying the current SNPN is updated or, if the UE supports
access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, the entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" associated with the lists is updated;
and

b\) periodically (with a period in the range 12 to 24 hours).

Over 3GPP access, when the lists are erased, the UE performs cell
selection according to 3GPP TS 38.304 \[28\] or 3GPP TS 36.304 \[25C\].
A tracking area shall be removed from the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\", as well as the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\", if the UE receives
the tracking area in the TAI list or the Service area list of \"allowed
tracking areas\" in REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or a CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message. The UE shall not remove the tracking area from
\"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" or \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\" if the UE is registered for
emergency services.

In N1 mode over 3GPP access, the UE shall update the suitable list
whenever a REGISTRATION REJECT, SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST
message is received with the 5GMM cause \#12 \"tracking area not
allowed\", \#13 \"roaming not allowed in this tracking area\", or \#15
\"no suitable cells in tracking area\", or a REGISTRATION ACCEPT or
SERVICE ACCEPT message is received with the forbidden TAI(s).

\...

\[24.501, clause 5.5.1.2.5\]

If the initial registration request cannot be accepted by the network,
the AMF shall send a REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate 5GMM cause value.

\...

If the AMF received multiple TAIs from the satellite NG-RAN as described
in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[8\], and determines that, by UE subscription and
operator\'s preferences, all of the received TAIs are forbidden for
roaming or for regional provision of service, the AMF shall include the
TAI(s) in:

a\) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas
for roaming\" IE; or

b\) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas
for regional provision of service\" IE; or

c\) both;

in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

Regardless of the 5GMM cause value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT
message via satellite NG-RAN,

\- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT
message and if the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of
\"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", the UE shall store the
TAI(s) included in the IE, if not already stored, into the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for roaming\"; and

\- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"5GS
forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE in the
REGISTRATION REJECT message and if the TAI(s) included in the IE is not
part of the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the
IE, if not already stored, into the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\".

Furthermore, the UE shall take the following actions depending on the
5GMM cause value received in the REGISTRATION REJECT message.

\#12 (Tracking area not allowed).

The UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.2.2) and shall delete
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally,
the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter.

If:

1\) the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode, the UE shall
store the current TAI in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\" and enter the state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. If the REGISTRATION REJECT message is
not integrity protected, the UE shall memorize the current TAI was
stored in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\" for non-integrity protected NAS reject message;
or

\...

If the message was received via 3GPP access and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall handle the EMM parameters EMM
state, EPS update status, 4G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI
list, eKSI and attach attempt counter as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\] for the case when the EPS attach request procedure
is rejected with the EMM cause with the same value.

\...

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in subclause 5.5.1.2.7.

\[23.501, clause 5.4.11.8\]

Forbidden Area functionality is supported as described in
clause 5.3.4.1.1 with the modifications described below:

\- The AMF and the UE receive the broadcast TAI (if a single TAI is
broadcast) or all broadcast TAIs (if multiple TAIs are broadcast) from
the NG-RAN as described clause 5.4.11.7. The AMF considers the UE to be
in a Forbidden Area if the only received TAI is forbidden or if all
received TAIs are forbidden based on subscription data. The UE considers
it is in a Forbidden Area if the only received TAI is forbidden, or if
all received TAIs are forbidden and is not within a Forbidden Area in
the case that at least one broadcast TAI is not forbidden.

\- If AMF receives multiple TAIs from the NG-RAN and determines that
some, but not all of them are forbidden by subscription or by operator
policy, the AMF shall send the forbidden TAI(s) to the UE as described
in clauses 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.3 in TS 23.502 \[3\]. The UE stores the
TAI(s) in the appropriate Forbidden Area list and removes the TAI(s)
from Registration Area if present.

Service Area Restrictions functionality is supported as described in
clause 5.3.4.1.2 with the modifications described below:

\- The AMF receives the broadcast TAI (if a single TAI is broadcast) or
all broadcast TAIs (if multiple TAIs are broadcast) from the NG-RAN as
described clause 5.4.11.7. The AMF provides the UE with Service Area
Restrictions which consist of either Allowed Areas or Non-Allowed Areas,
as described in clause 5.3.4.1.2. The UE and AMF consider the UE to be
in a Non-Allowed Area if none of the broadcast TAIs is Allowed. The UE
and AMF consider the UE to be in an Allowed Area if at least one
broadcast TAI is allowed.

##### 10.1.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-102 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1.2.1, 6.3.1.2.2 and 6.4.1.4. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements[.]{.underline}

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.1.2.1\]

In order to initiate the PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure,
the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message.

The SMF shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message to \"No procedure transaction identity assigned\".

The SMF shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
COMMAND message to the EAP-request message provided by the DN or
generated locally.

The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message, and
the SMF shall start timer T3590 (see example in figure 6.3.1.1).

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, the UE passes to the upper layers the EAP message
received in the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message. Apart from this action, the authentication and authorization
procedure initiated by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM layer of the
UE.

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.1.2.2\]

When the upper layers provide an EAP-response message responding to the
received EAP-request message, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION
AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message.

The UE shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
COMPLETE message to the EAP-response message.

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message
and the PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified
in subclause 5.4.5. Apart from this action, the authentication and
authorization procedure initiated by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM
layer of the UE.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message, the SMF
shall stop timer T3590 and provides the EAP message received in the EAP
message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the DN
or handles it locally.

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.4.1.4\]

If the connectivity with the requested DN is rejected by the network,
the SMF shall create a SM PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.

The SMF shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REJECT message to indicate the reason for rejecting the PDU session
establishment.

The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause
values:

\#8 operator determined barring;

\#26 insufficient resources;

\#27 missing or unknown DNN;

\#28 unknown PDU session type;

\#29 user authentication or authorization failed;

10.1.1.1.3 Test description

##### 10.1.1.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-103 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1.1, clause 6.3.1.2.1, 6.3.1.2.2 and
6.3.1.3.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements[.]{.underline}

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.1.1\]

The purpose of the PDU session authentication and authorization
procedure is to enable the DN:

a\) to authenticate the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the
PDU session;

b\) to authorize the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the PDU
session;

c\) both of the above; or

d\) to re-authenticate the upper layers of the UE after establishment of
the PDU session.

The PDU session authentication and authorization procedure can be
performed only during or after the UE-requested PDU session procedure
establishing a non-emergency PDU session. The PDU session authentication
and authorization procedure shall not be performed during or after the
UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure establishing an
emergency PDU session.

The network authenticates the UE using the Extensible Authentication
Protocol (EAP) as specified in IETF RFC 3748 \[32\].

EAP has defined four types of EAP messages:

a\) an EAP-request message;

b\) an EAP-response message;

c\) an EAP-success message; and

d\) an EAP-failure message.

The EAP-request message is transported from the network to the UE using
the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message of the PDU EAP message
reliable transport procedure.

The EAP-response message to the EAP-request message is transported from
the UE to the network using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE
message of the PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure.

If the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is
performed during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure:

a\) and the DN authentication of the UE completes successfully, the
EAP-success message is transported from the network to the UE as part of
the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message.

b\) and the DN authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully, the
EAP-failure message is transported from the network to the UE as part of
the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.

If the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is
performed after the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure:

a\) and the DN authentication of the UE completes successfully, the
EAP-success message is transported from the network to the UE using the
PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the PDU EAP result message
transport procedure.

b\) and the DN authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully, the
EAP-failure message is transported from the network to the UE using the
PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message of the network-requested PDU session
release procedure.

There can be several rounds of exchange of an EAP-request message and a
related EAP-response message for the DN to complete the authentication
and authorization of the request for a PDU session (see example in
figure 6.3.1.1).

The SMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in
IETF RFC 3748 \[34\] subclause 4.3 to infinite value.

NOTE: The PDU session authentication and authorization procedure
provides a reliable transport of EAP messages and therefore
retransmissions at the EAP layer of the SMF do not occur.

Figure 6.3.1.1: PDU session authentication and authorization procedure

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.1.2.1\]

In order to initiate the PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure,
the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message.

The SMF shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message to \"No procedure transaction identity assigned\".

The SMF shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
COMMAND message to the EAP-request message provided by the DN or
generated locally.

The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message, and
the SMF shall start timer T3590 (see example in figure 6.3.1.1).

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, the UE passes to the upper layers the EAP message
received in the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message. Apart from this action, the authentication and authorization
procedure initiated by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM layer of the
UE.

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.1.2.2\]

When the upper layers provide an EAP-response message responding to the
received EAP-request message, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION
AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message.

The UE shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
COMPLETE message to the EAP-response message.

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message
and the PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified
in subclause 5.4.5. Apart from this action, the authentication and
authorization procedure initiated by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM
layer of the UE.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message, the SMF
shall stop timer T3590 and provides the EAP message received in the EAP
message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the DN
or handles it locally.

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.1.3.1\]

In order to initiate the PDU EAP result message transport procedure, the
SMF shall create a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT message.

The SMF shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT
message to \"No procedure transaction identity assigned\".

The SMF shall set the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
RESULT message to the EAP-success message provided by the DN.

The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT message.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, the UE passes to the upper layers the EAP message
received in the EAP message IE of the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT
message. Apart from this action, the authentication and authorization
procedure initiated by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM layer of the
UE.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.2.3\]

Upon receipt of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message, if the UE
provided a DNN during the PDU session establishment, the UE shall stop
timer T3396, if it is running for the DNN provided by the UE. If the UE
did not provide a DNN during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop the
timer T3396 associated with no DNN if it is running. If the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message was received for an emergency PDU session,
the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no DNN if it is
running.

Upon receipt of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message, if the UE
provided an S-NSSAI and a DNN during the PDU session establishment, the
UE shall stop timer T3584, if it is running for the same \[S-NSSAI,
DNN\] combination provided by the UE. If the UE did not provide an
S-NSSAI during the PDU session establishment, the UE shall stop timer
T3584, if it is running for the same \[no S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination
provided by the UE. If the UE provided neither a DNN nor an S-NSSAI
during the PDU session establishment, the UE shall stop timer T3584, if
it is running for the same \[no S-NSSAI, no DNN\] combination provided
by the UE.

Upon receipt of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message, if the UE
provided an S-NSSAI during the PDU session establishment, the UE shall
stop timer T3585, if it is running for the S-NSSAI provided by the UE.
If the UE did not provide an S-NSSAI during the PDU session
establishment and the request type was different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", the UE shall stop the timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI
if it is running. If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message was
received for an emergency PDU session, the UE shall not stop the timer
T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running.

NOTE 1: Upon receipt of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for
a PDU session, if the UE provided a DNN (or no DNN) and an S-NSSAI (or
no S-NSSAI) when the PDU session is established, timer T3396 associated
with the DNN (or no DNN, if no DNN was provided by the UE) is running,
and timer T3584 associated with the DNN (or no DNN, if no DNN was
provided by the UE) and the S-NSSAI (or no S-NSSAI, if no S-NSSAI was
provided by the UE) is running, then the UE stops both the timer T3396
and the timer T3584.

NOTE 2: Upon receipt of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for
a PDU session, if the UE provided a DNN (or no DNN) and an S-NSSAI (or
no S-NSSAI) when the PDU session is established, timer T3585 associated
with the S-NSSAI (or no S-NSSAI, if no S-NSSAI was provided by the UE)
is running, and timer T3584 associated with the DNN (or no DNN, if no
DNN was provided by the UE) and the S-NSSAI (or no S-NSSAI, if no
S-NSSAI was provided by the UE) is running, then the UE stops both the
timer T3585 and the timer T3584.

If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message includes the Authorized
QoS rules IE, the UE shall process the QoS rules sequentially starting
with the first QoS rule.

The UE shall replace the stored authorized QoS rules, authorized QoS
flow descriptions and session-AMBR of the PDU session with the received
value(s), if any, in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message.

If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message includes a Mapped EPS
bearer contexts IE, the UE shall check each mapped EPS bearer context
for different types of errors as follows:

NOTE 3: An error detected in a mapped EPS bearer context does not cause
the UE to discard the Authorized QoS rules IE and Authorized QoS flow
descriptions IE included in the PDU SESSION MODICATION COMMAND message,
if any.

a\) Semantic error in the mapped EPS bearer operation:

1\) operation code = \"Create new EPS bearer\" and there is already an
existing mapped EPS bearer context with the same EPS bearer identity
associated with any PDU session.

2\) operation code = \"Delete existing EPS bearer\" and there is no
existing mapped EPS bearer context with the same EPS bearer identity
associated with the PDU session that is being modified.

3\) operation code = \"Modify existing EPS bearer\" and there is no
existing mapped EPS bearer context with the same EPS bearer identity
associated with the PDU session that is being modified.

In case 1, if the existing mapped EPS bearer context is associated with
the PDU session that is being modified, the UE shall not diagnose an
error, further process the create request and, if it was process
successfully, delete the old EPS bearer context.

In case 2, the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the
delete request and, if it was processed successfully, consider the
mapped EPS bearer context as successfully deleted.

Otherwise, after sending the PDU SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the
ongoing PDU session modification procedure, the UE shall initiate a PDU
session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause
\#85 \"Invalid mapped EPS bearer identity\".

b\) if the mapped EPS bearer context includes a traffic flow template,
the UE shall check the traffic flow template for different types of TFT
IE errors as follows:

2\) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

i\) TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\" when there is already an
existing TFT for the EPS bearer context.

ii\) When the TFT operation is an operation other than \"Create a new
TFT\" and there is no TFT for the EPS bearer context.

iii\) TFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" when
it would render the TFT empty.

iv\) TFT operation = \"Delete existing TFT\" for a dedicated EPS bearer
context.

In case iv, after sending the PDU SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the
ongoing PDU session modification procedure, the UE shall initiate a PDU
session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause
\#41 \"semantic error in the TFT operation\".

In the other cases the UE shall not diagnose an error and perform the
following actions to resolve the inconsistency:

In case i, the UE shall further process the new activation request and,
if it was processed successfully, delete the old TFT.

In case ii, the UE shall:

\- process the new request and if the TFT operation is \"Delete existing
TFT\" or \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", and if no error
according to items b, c, and d was detected, consider the TFT as
successfully deleted;

\- process the new request as an activation request, if the TFT
operation is \"Add packet filters in existing TFT\" or \"Replace packet
filters in existing TFT\".

In case iii, if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer
context, the UE shall process the new deletion request and, if no error
according to items b, c, and d was detected, after sending the PDU
SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification
procedure, the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by
sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped
EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause \#41 \"semantic error in the TFT
operation\".

In case iii, if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer
context, the UE shall process the new deletion request and if no error
according to items b, c, and d was detected then delete the existing
TFT, this corresponds to using match-all packet filter for the default
EPS bearer context.

2\) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

i\) When the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\", \"Add packet filters
in existing TFT\", \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" or
\"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" and the packet filter list
in the TFT IE is empty.

ii\) TFT operation = \"Delete existing TFT\" or \"No TFT operation\"
with a non-empty packet filter list in the TFT IE.

iii\) TFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" when
the packet filter to be replaced does not exist in the original TFT.

iv\) TFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" when
the packet filter to be deleted does not exist in the original TFT.

v\) TFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" with a
packet filter list also including packet filters in addition to the
packet filter identifiers.

vi\) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of
the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters
subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

In case iii, the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the
replace request and, if no error according to items c and d was
detected, include the packet filters received to the existing TFT.

In case iv, the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the
deletion request and, if no error according to items c and d was
detected, consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.

Otherwise, after sending the PDU SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the
ongoing PDU session modification procedure, the UE shall initiate a PDU
session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause
\#42 \"syntactical error in the TFT operation\".

3\) Semantic errors in packet filters:

i\) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter
components which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP
packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a
semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present
document.

ii\) When the resulting TFT, which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer
context, does not contain any packet filter applicable for the uplink
direction among the packet filters created on request from the network.

After sending the PDU SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU
session modification procedure, the UE shall initiate a PDU session
modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause \#44
\"semantic errors in packet filter(s)\".

4\) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

i\) When the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\", \"Add packet filters
to existing TFT\", and two or more packet filters in the resultant TFT
would have identical packet filter identifiers.

ii\) When the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\", \"Add packet filters
to existing TFT\" or \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", and two
or more packet filters among all TFTs associated with this PDN
connection would have identical packet filter precedence values.

iii\) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of
packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter
component identifier.

In case i, if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter
identifiers are contained in the new request, after sending the PDU
SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the ongoing PDU session modification
procedure, the UE shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure by
sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to delete the mapped
EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause \#45 \"syntactical error in packet
filter(s)\". Otherwise, the UE shall not diagnose an error, further
process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, delete
the old packet filters which have the identical packet filter
identifiers.

In case ii, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the UE shall not diagnose an error, shall further
process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall
delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence
values.

In case ii, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS
bearer context, after sending the PDU SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for
the ongoing PDU session modification procedure, the UE shall initiate a
PDU session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause
\#45 \"syntactical errors in packet filter(s)\".

Otherwise, after sending the PDU SESSSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE for the
ongoing PDU session modification procedure, the UE shall initiate a PDU
session modification procedure by sending a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message to delete the mapped EPS bearer context with 5GSM cause
\#45 \"syntactical error in packet filter(s)\".

And if a new EPS bearer identity parameter in authorized QoS flow
descriptions IE is received for a QoS flow which can be transferred to
EPS, the UE shall update the association between the QoS flow and the
mapped EPS bearer context, based on the new EPS bearer identity and the
mapped EPS bearer contexts. If the \"Delete existing EPS bearer\"
operation code in the Mapped EPS bearer contexts IE was received, the UE
shall discard the association between the QoS flow and the corresponding
mapped EPS bearer context.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, if the UE accepts the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND
message, the UE considers the PDU session as modified and the UE shall
create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message.

If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message contains the PTI value
allocated in the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure, the UE
shall stop the timer T3581. The UE should ensure that the PTI value
assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.

NOTE 4: The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. For
example, the UE can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure
is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default
value of timer T3591.

While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any received PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message with the same PTI value as a
network retransmission (see subclause 7.3.1).

If the selected SSC mode of the PDU session is \"SSC mode 3\" and the
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\", the UE can provide to the upper layers the
PDU session address lifetime if received in the PDU session address
lifetime PCO parameter of the Extended protocol configuration options IE
of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message. After the completion of
the network-requested PDU session modification procedure, the UE should
re-initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure with a
new PDU session ID as specified in subclause 6.4.1 for:

a\) the PDU session type associated with the present PDU session;

b\) the SSC mode associated with the present PDU session;

c\) the DNN associated with the present PDU session; and

d\) the S-NSSAI associated with (if available in roaming scenarios) a
mapped S-NSSAI if provided in the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure of the present PDU session.

The UE shall include the PDU session ID of the old PDU session which is
about to get released in the old PDU session ID IE of the UL NAS
TRANSPORT message that transports the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message.

NOTE 5: The UE is expected to maintain the PDU session for which the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message including 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\" is received during the time indicated by the
PDU session address lifetime value or until receiving an indication from
upper layers (e.g. that the old PDU session is no more needed).

If the selected PDU session type of the PDU session is \"Unstructured\"
or \"Ethernet\", the UE supports inter-system change from N1 mode to S1
mode, the UE does not support establishment of a PDN connection for the
PDN type set to \"non-IP\" in S1 mode, and the parameters list field of
one or more authorized QoS flow descriptions received in the authorized
QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
contains an EPS bearer identity (EBI) then the UE shall locally remove
the EPS bearer identity (EBI) from the parameters list field of such one
or more authorized QoS flow descriptions.

If the Always-on PDU session indication IE is included in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and:

a\) the value of the IE is set to \"Always-on PDU session required\",
the UE shall consider the established PDU session as an always-on PDU
session; or

b\) the value of the IE is set to \"Always-on PDU session not allowed\",
the UE shall not consider the established PDU session as an always-on
PDU session.

If the UE does not receive the Always-on PDU session indication IE in
the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message:

a\) if the network-requested PDU session modification procedure is
triggered by a UE-requested PDU session modification procedure upon the
first inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode for a PDN connection
established when in S1 mode, the UE shall not consider the modified PDU
session as an always-on PDU session; or

b\) otherwise:

1\) if the UE has received the Always-on PDU session indication IE with
the value set to \"Always-on PDU session required\" for this PDU
session, the UE shall consider the PDU session as an always-on PDU
session; or

2\) otherwise the UE shall not consider the PDU session as an always-on
PDU session.

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message and
the PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5.

After sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message, if the
\"Create new EPS bearer\" operation code in the mapped EPS bearer
contexts IE was received in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
and there is neither a corresponding authorized QoS flow descriptions IE
in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message nor an existing QoS flow
description corresponding to the EPS bearer identity included in the
mapped EPS bearer context, the UE shall send a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message including a mapped EPS bearer contexts IE to delete the
mapped EPS bearer context.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE message, the SMF
shall stop timer T3591 and shall consider the PDU session as modified.
If the selected SSC mode of the PDU session is \"SSC mode 3\" and the
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message included 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\", the SMF shall start timer T3593. If the PDU
Session Address Lifetime value is sent to the UE in the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message then timer T3593 shall be started with the
same value, otherwise it shall use a default value.

\[TS 24.008, clause 10.5.6.12\]

The purpose of the *traffic flow template* information element is to
specify the TFT parameters and operations for a PDP context. In
addition, this information element may be used to transfer extra
parameters to the network (e.g. the Authorization Token; see 3GPP TS
24.229 \[95\]). The TFT may contain packet filters for the downlink
direction, the uplink direction or packet filters that are applicable to
both directions. The packet filters determine the traffic mapping to PDP
contexts. The downlink packet filters shall be used by the network and
the uplink packet filters shall be used by the MS. A packet filter that
is applicable to both directions shall be used by the network as a
downlink packet filter and by the MS as an uplink packet filter.

The *traffic flow template* is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 3 octets. The maximum length for the IE is 257 octets.

NOTE 1: The IE length restriction is due to the maximum length that can
be encoded in a single length octet.

NOTE 2: A maximum size IPv4 packet filter can be 32 bytes. Therefore, 7
maximum size IPv4 type packet filters, plus the last packet filter which
can contain max 30 octets can fit into one TFT IE, i.e. if needed not
all packet filter components can be defined into one message. A maximum
size IPv6 packet filter can be 60 bytes. Therefore, only 4 maximum size
IPv6 packet filters can fit into one TFT IE. However, using \"Add packet
filters to existing TFT\", it\'s possible to create a TFT data structure
including 16 maximum size IPv4 or IPv6 filters.

The *traffic flow template* information element is coded as shown in
figure 10.5.144/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.162/3GPP TS 24.008.

NOTE 3: The 3GPP TS 24.301 \[120\] reuses the traffic flow template
information element for the purpose of the traffic flow aggregate
description, where the use of individual TFT parameters, e.g. the packet
filter identifier in the parameter list, can differ from this
specification.

| The *parameter identifier* field is used to identify each parameter  |
| included in the *parameters list* and it contains the hexadecimal    |
| coding of the parameter identifier. Bit 8 of the *parameter          |
| identifier* field contains the most significant bit and bit 1        |
| contains the least significant bit. In this version of the protocol, |
| the following parameter identifiers are specified:                   |
|                                                                      |

|                                                                      |
| \- 02H (Flow Identifier); and\                                       |
| - 03H (Packet Filter Identifier).                                    |
|                                                                      |
| If the *parameters list* contains a parameter identifier that is not |
| supported by the receiving entity the corresponding parameter shall  |
| be discarded.                                                        |
|                                                                      |
| The *length of parameter contents* field contains the binary coded   |
| representation of the length of the *parameter contents* field. The  |
| first bit in transmission order is the most significant bit.         |
|                                                                      |
| When the *parameter identifier* indicates Authorization Token, the   |
| *parameter contents* field contains an authorization token, as       |
| specified in 3GPP TS 29.207 \[100\]. The first octet is the most     |
| significant octet of the authorization token and the last octet is   |
| the least significant octet of the authorization token.              |
|                                                                      |
| The *parameters list* shall be coded in a way that an Authorization  |
| Token (i.e. a parameter with identifier 01H) is always followed by   |
| one or more Flow Identifiers (i.e. one or more parameters with       |
| identifier 02H).                                                     |
|                                                                      |
| If the *parameters list* contains two or more consecutive            |
| Authorization Tokens without any Flow Identifiers in between, the    |
| receiver shall treat this as a semantical TFT error.                 |
|                                                                      |
| When the *parameter identifier* indicates Flow Identifier, the       |
| *parameter contents* field contains the binary representation of a   |
| flow identifier. The Flow Identifier consists of four octets. Octets |
| 1 and 2 contains the Media Component number as specified in          |
| 3GPP TS 29.207 \[100\]. Bit 1 of octet 2 is the least significant    |
| bit, and bit 8 of octet 1 is the most significant bit. Octets 3 and  |
| 4 contains the IP flow number as specified in 3GPP TS 29.207         |
| \[100\]. Bit 1 of octet 4 is the least significant bit, and bit 8 of |
| octet 3 is the most significant bit.                                 |
|                                                                      |
| When the *parameter identifier* indicates Packet Filter Identifier,  |
| the parameter contents field contains the binary representation of   |
| one or more packet filter identifiers. Each packet filter identifier |
| is encoded in one octet, in the 4 least significant bits. This       |
| parameter is used by the MS and the network to identify one or more  |
| packet filters in a TFT when modifying the QoS of a PDP context      |
| without modifying the packet filter itself.                          |

##### 10.1.2.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-106 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.229 \[44\], clause U.2.2.1, U.2.2.1C, TS
24.501\[22\], clause 6.3.2.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements.

\[TS 24.229 clause U.2.2.1\]:

Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:

...

d\) acquire a P-CSCF address(es).

The methods for P-CSCF discovery are:

I. When using IPv4, employ the DHCP RFC 2132 \[20F\], the DHCPv4 options
for SIP servers RFC 3361 \[35A\], and RFC 3263 \[27A\] as described in
subclause 9.2.1. When using IPv6, employ Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) RFC 3315 \[40\], the DHCPv6 options for SIP
servers RFC 3319 \[41\] and DHCPv6 options for DNS RFC 3646 \[56C\] as
described in subclause 9.2.1.

II\. Transfer P-CSCF address(es) within the 5GS PDU session
establishment procedure.

The UE shall indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the network
within the extended Protocol Configuration Options information element
of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

If the network provides the UE with a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6
addresses in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message, the UE shall
assume that the list is ordered top-down with the first P-CSCF address
within the extended Protocol Configuration Options information element
as the P-CSCF address having the highest preference and the last P-CSCF
address within the extended Protocol Configuration Options information
element as the P-CSCF address having the lowest preference.

...

The UE can freely select method I or II for P-CSCF discovery, if:

\- the UE is in the home network; or

\- the UE is roaming and the P-CSCF is to be discovered in the visited
network.

...

\[TS 24.229 clause U.2.2.1C\]:

A UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure performs one of the
following procedures:

A if the UE used method II for P-CSCF discovery and if the UE receives
one or more P-CSCF address(es) in the extended Protocol Configuration
Options information element of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND
message and the one or more P-CSCF addresse(s) do not include the
address of the currently used P-CSCF, then the UE shall acquire a
different P-CSCF address from the one or more P-CSCF addresse(s) in the
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message. If more than one P-CSCF
address with the same container identifier (i.e. \"P-CSCF IPv6 Address\"
or \"P-CSCF IPv4 Address\") are included, then the UE shall assume that
the more than one P-CSCF addresses with the same container identifier
are prioritised with the first P-CSCF address with the same container
identifier within the Protocol Configuration Options information element
as the P-CSCF address with the highest priority.

If the UE used method II for P-CSCF discovery and if the UE has
previously sent the \"P-CSCF Re-selection support\" PCO indicator at PDU
session creation and if the UE receives one or more P-CSCF address(es)
in the extended Protocol Configuration Options information element of a
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message, then the UE shall acquire a
P-CSCF address from the one or more P-CSCF addresse(s) in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message. If more than one P-CSCF address
with the same container identifier (i.e. \"P-CSCF IPv6 Address\" or
\"P-CSCF IPv4 Address\") are included, then the UE shall assume that the
more than one P-CSCF addresses with the same container identifier are
prioritised with the first P-CSCF address with the same container
identifier within the Protocol Configuration Options information element
as the P-CSCF address with the highest priority;

B if the UE uses RFC 6223 \[143\] as part of P-CSCF restoration
procedures, and if the P-CSCF fails to respond to a keep-alive request,
then the UE shall acquire a different P-CSCF address using one of the
methods I, III and IV for P-CSCF discovery described in the
subclause U.2.2.1.

If the UE has an ongoing session and acquired the new P-CSCF address by
using procedure A described above, the UE may wait until the UE has
detected that the ongoing session has ended before performing an initial
registration as specified in subclause 5.1.

...

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.2.2\]:

...

When UE has requested P-CSCF IPv6 address or P-CSCF IPv4 address and the
SMF has provided P-CSCF address(es) during the PDU session establishment
procedure, if the network-requested PDU session modification procedure
is triggered for P-CSCF restoration, the SMF shall include the P-CSCF IP
address(es) in the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message as specified in subclause 5.8.2.2
of 3GPP TS 23.380 \[54\].

##### 10.1.3.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-107 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.2 and 6.3.3.3. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.2\]

In order to initiate the network-requested PDU session release
procedure, the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.

The SMF shall set the SM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
message to indicate the reason for releasing the PDU session.

The SM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause
values:

\#26 insufficient resources;

...

\#67 insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN;

...

The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause value \#26 \"insufficient
resources\" is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message. If
the 5GSM cause value is \#26 \"insufficient resources\" and the PDU
SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is sent to a UE configured for high
priority access in selected PLMN or the request type was set to
\"initial emergency request\" or \"existing emergency PDU session\" for
the establishment of the PDU session, the network shall not include a
Back-off timer value IE.

The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause value \#67 \"insufficient resources
for specific slice and DNN\" is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message. If the 5GSM cause value is \#67 \"insufficient
resources for specific slice and DNN\" and the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message is sent to a UE configured for high priority access in
selected PLMN or the request type was set to \"initial emergency
request\" or \"existing emergency PDU session\" for the establishment of
the PDU session, the network shall not include a Back-off timer value
IE.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.3\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5,
the UE considers the PDU session as released and the UE shall create a
PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

...

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#26
\"insufficient resources\" and the Back-off timer value IE, the UE shall
take different actions depending on the timer value received for timer
T3396 in the Back-off timer value:

a\) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and a DNN
was provided during the PDU session establishment, the UE shall stop
timer T3396 associated with the corresponding DNN, if it is running. If
the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and no DNN was
provided during the PDU session establishment and the request type was
different from \"initial emergency request\" and different from
\"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop timer T3396
associated with no DNN if it is running. The UE shall then start timer
T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

1\) shall not send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified
in subclause 6.4.2.1, for the same DNN that was sent by the UE, until
timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped; and

2\) shall not send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without
an DNN and with request type different from \"initial emergency
request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or a
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those
identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session
established without an DNN provided by the UE, if no DNN was provided
during the PDU session establishment and the request type was different
from \"initial emergency request\" and different from \"existing
emergency PDU session\", until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is
stopped.

The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b\) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and a
DNN was provided during the PDU session establishment, the UE shall stop
timer T3396 associated with the corresponding DNN, if it is running. If
the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and no DNN was
provided during the PDU session establishment and the request type was
different from \"initial emergency request\" and different from
\"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop timer T3396
associated with no DNN if it is running. The UE:

1\) shall not send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified
in subclause 6.4.2.1, for the same DNN until the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message for the same DNN from the network or a PDU SESSION
RELEASE COMMAND message including 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation
requested\" for the same DNN from the network; and

2\) shall not send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without
an DNN and with request type different from \"initial emergency
request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or a
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those
identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session
established without an DNN provided by the UE, if no DNN was provided
during the PDU session establishment and the request type was different
from \"initial emergency request\" and different from \"existing
emergency PDU session\", until the UE is switched off or the USIM is
removed, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
for a non-emergency PDU session established without an DNN provided by
the UE, or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message including 5GSM cause IE
set to 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an DNN provided by the UE.

The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c\) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

1\) shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding DNN, if
running, and may send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same DNN; and

2\) if no DNN was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3396 associated with no DNN, if running, and may send a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without a DNN, or a PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an DNN provided by the UE.

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#26
\"insufficient resources\" and the Back-off timer value IE is not
included, then the UE may send a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST
message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same DNN or
without a DNN.

When the timer T3396 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE
remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or
it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall
behave as follows:

\- let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let
t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

If the 5GSM cause value is \#67 \"insufficient resources for specific
slice and DNN\" and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE
shall take different actions depending on the timer value received for
timer T3584 in the Back-off timer value:

a\) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall stop timer T3584 associated with the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\]
combination as that the UE provided when the PDU session is established,
if it is running. The UE shall then start timer T3584 with the value
provided in the Back-off timer value IE.

The UE shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified in
subclause 6.4.2.1, for the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination that was
sent by the UE, until timer T3584 expires or timer T3584 is stopped;

The UE shall not stop timer T3584 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b\) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE
shall stop timer T3584 associated with the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\]
combination as that the UE provided when the PDU session is established,
if it is running.

The UE shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified in
subclause 6.4.2.1, for the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination that was
sent by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or
the UE receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same
\[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message including 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for
the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination from the network; and

The timer T3584 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c\) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE shall stop timer T3584
associated with the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination that was sent by
the UE, if running, and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same
\[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination.

If the 5GSM cause value is \#67 \"insufficient resources for specific
slice and DNN\" and the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then
the UE may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\]
combination.

When the timer T3584 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

If the timer T3584 is running when the UE enters state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE
remains the same, then timer T3584 is kept running until it expires or
it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3584 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall
behave as follows:

\- let t1 be the time remaining for T3584 timeout at switch off and let
t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.6\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) PDU session inactive for the received PDU session ID.

If the PDU session ID in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message belongs
to any PDU session in state PDU SESSION INACTIVE in the UE, the UE shall
include the 5GSM cause \#43 \"Invalid PDU session identity\" in the 5GSM
STATUS message, and set the PDU session ID to the received PDU session
ID in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in subclause 5.4.5.

\[TS 24.501, clause B.1\]

Cause \#43 --Invalid PDU session identity

This 5GSM cause is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the
PDU session identity value provided to it is not a valid value or the
PDU session identified by the PDU session identity IE in the request or
the command is not active.

\[24.501, clause 7.3.2\]

...

The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an unknown,
erroneous, or unforeseen PDU session identity received in the header of
a 5GSM message:

a\) If the UE receives a 5GSM message which includes an unassigned or
reserved PDU session identity value, the UE shall ignore the message.

b\) If the UE receives a 5GSM message which includes a PDU session
identity belonging to any PDU session in state PDU SESSION INACTIVE in
the UE, the UE shall respond with a 5GSM STATUS message including 5GSM
cause \#43 \"invalid PDU session identity\".

##### 10.1.3.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-108 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.229, clause U.2.2.1, U.2.2.1C, TS 24.501, clause
6.3.3.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.229 clause U.2.2.1\]:

Prior to communication with the IM CN subsystem, the UE shall:

...

d\) acquire a P-CSCF address(es).

The methods for P-CSCF discovery are:

I. When using IPv4, employ the DHCP RFC 2132 \[20F\], the DHCPv4 options
for SIP servers RFC 3361 \[35A\], and RFC 3263 \[27A\] as described in
subclause 9.2.1. When using IPv6, employ Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) RFC 3315 \[40\], the DHCPv6 options for SIP
servers RFC 3319 \[41\] and DHCPv6 options for DNS RFC 3646 \[56C\] as
described in subclause 9.2.1.

II\. Transfer P-CSCF address(es) within the 5GS PDU session
establishement procedure.

The UE shall indicate the request for a P-CSCF address to the network
within the extended Protocol Configuration Options information element
of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message.

If the network provides the UE with a list of P-CSCF IPv4 or IPv6
addresses in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message, the UE shall
assume that the list is ordered top-down with the first P-CSCF address
within the extended Protocol Configuration Options information element
as the P-CSCF address having the highest preference and the last P-CSCF
address within the extended Protocol Configuration Options information
element as the P-CSCF address having the lowest preference.

...

The UE can freely select method I or II for P-CSCF discovery, if:

\- the UE is in the home network; or

\- the UE is roaming and the P-CSCF is to be discovered in the visited
network.

...

\[TS 24.229 clause U.2.2.1C\]:

A UE supporting the P-CSCF restoration procedure performs one of the
following procedures:

A if the UE used method II for P-CSCF discovery and if the UE receives
one or more P-CSCF address(es) in the extended Protocol Configuration
Options information element of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND
message and the one or more P-CSCF addresse(s) do not include the
address of the currently used P-CSCF, then the UE shall acquire a
different P-CSCF address from the one or more P-CSCF addresse(s) in the
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message. If more than one P-CSCF
address with the same container identifier (i.e. \"P-CSCF IPv6 Address\"
or \"P-CSCF IPv4 Address\") are included, then the UE shall assume that
the more than one P-CSCF addresses with the same container identifier
are prioritised with the first P-CSCF address with the same container
identifier within the Protocol Configuration Options information element
as the P-CSCF address with the highest priority.

If the UE used method II for P-CSCF discovery and if the UE has
previously sent the \"P-CSCF Re-selection support\" PCO indicator at PDU
session creation and if the UE receives one or more P-CSCF address(es)
in the extended Protocol Configuration Options information element of a
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message, then the UE shall acquire a
P-CSCF address from the one or more P-CSCF addresse(s) in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message. If more than one P-CSCF address
with the same container identifier (i.e. \"P-CSCF IPv6 Address\" or
\"P-CSCF IPv4 Address\") are included, then the UE shall assume that the
more than one P-CSCF addresses with the same container identifier are
prioritised with the first P-CSCF address with the same container
identifier within the Protocol Configuration Options information element
as the P-CSCF address with the highest priority;

B if the UE uses RFC 6223 \[143\] as part of P-CSCF restoration
procedures, and if the P-CSCF fails to respond to a keep-alive request,
then the UE shall acquire a different P-CSCF address using one of the
methods I, III and IV for P-CSCF discovery described in the
subclause U.2.2.1.

If the UE has an ongoing session and acquired the new P-CSCF address by
using procedure A described above, the UE may wait until the UE has
detected that the ongoing session has ended before performing an initial
registration as specified in subclause 5.1.

...

\[TS 24.501 clause 6.3.3.3\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5,
the UE considers the PDU session as released and the UE shall create a
PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

...

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\", then after completion of the
network-requested PDU session release procedure, the UE should
re-initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure as
specified in subclause 6.4.1 for:

a\) the PDU session type associated with the released PDU session;

b\) the SSC mode associated with the released PDU session;

c\) the DNN associated with the released PDU session; and

d\) the S-NSSAI associated with (if availablde in roaming scenarios) a
mapped S-NSSAI if provided in the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure of the released PDU session.

...

NOTE 2: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
automatically.

...

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message and the
PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5.

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message, the SMF shall
stop timer T3592 and shall consider the PDU session as released.

##### (1) {#section-261 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state and at least one PDU session
has been established. the SS sends PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND with \#39
\"reactivation requested\", and the UE has sent a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message }

**ensure that** {

**when** { On the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th expiry of timer T3580 }

**then** { the UE retransmits PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
and the PDU session information which was transported together with the
initial transmission of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message }

}

##### (2) {#section-262 .H6}

**with** { the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state and has sent a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message }

**ensure that** {

**when** { on the maximum 5th expiry of timer T3580 }

**then** { the UE aborts the procedure }

}

##### 10.1.4.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-109 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.6. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.6\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a\) Expiry of timer T3580

The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3580, retransmit the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and the PDU session information
which was transported together with the initial transmission of the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer
T3580, if still needed. This retransmission can be repeated up to four
times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3580, the UE shall abort the

##### 10.1.4.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-110 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 6.3.1A.1, 6.3.1A.2, 6.3.1A.3, 6.4.1.2
and 6.4.1.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1A.1\]

The purpose of the service-level authentication and authorization
(service-level-AA) procedure is to enable the DN using NEF services for
authentication:

a\) to authenticate the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the
PDU session;

b\) to authorize the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the PDU
session;

c\) both of the above; or

d\) to re-authenticate the upper layers of the UE after establishment of
the PDU session.

The service-level authentication and authorization procedure are used
for UUAA as specified in TS 23.256 \[6AB\].

NOTE 1: The authentication protocol for UUAA is out of scope of 3GPP in
this release of specification.

The service-level authentication and authorization procedure can be
performed only during or after the UE-requested PDU session procedure
establishing a non-emergency PDU session. The service-level
authentication and authorization procedure shall not be performed during
or after the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
establishing an emergency PDU session.

If the service-level authentication and authorization procedure is
performed during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure:

a\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes successfully,
the service-level-AA response is transported from the network to the UE
as a part of the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure in the
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message; or

b\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes
unsuccessfully, the service-level-AA response is transported from the
network to the UE as a part of the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.

NOTE 2: If the SMF receives the HTTP code set to \"4xx\" or \"5xx\" as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 \[20AA\] or the SMF detects a UUAA-SM
failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.256 \[21B\], then the SMF considers
that the UUAA-SM procedure has completed unsuccessfully.

If the service-level authentication and authorization procedure is
performed for the established PDU session with re-authentication
purpose:

a\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes successfully,
the service-level-AA response is transported from the network to the UE
as a part of the network-requested PDU session modification procedure in
the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message; or

b\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes
unsuccessfully, the service-level-AA response is transported from the
network to the UE as a part of the network-requested PDU session release
procedure in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.

There can be several rounds of exchange of a service-level-AA payload
for the service to complete the service-level authentication and
authorization of the request for a PDU session (see example in
figure 6.3.1A.1-1).

If the UE receives the service-level-AA response in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message or the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT
message, the UE passes it to the upper layer.

Figure 6.3.1A.1-1: Service-level authentication and authorization
procedure

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1A.2\]

In order to initiate the service-level authentication and authorization
procedure, the SMF shall create a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message.

The SMF shall set the PTI IE of the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message to \"No procedure transaction identity assigned\".

The SMF shall set the service-level-AA payload in the Service-level-AA
container IE of the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to the
payload provided by the DN via the NEF. If a payload type associated
with the payload is provided by the DN via the NEF, the SMF shall set
the service-level-AA payload type with the value set to the payload
type.

NOTE: In case of UUAA, the service-level-AA payload is provided by the
DN via the UAS-NF.

The SMF shall send the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message, and
the SMF shall start timer T3594 (see example in figure 6.3.1A.1-1).

Upon receipt of a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, the UE passes to the upper layers the service-level-AA
payload received in the Service-level-AA container IE of the
SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message. Apart from this action,
the service-level authentication and authorization procedure initiated
by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM layer of the UE.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1A.2\]

When the upper layers provide a service-level-AA payload, the UE shall
create a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message and set the
service-level-AA payload of the Service-level-AA container IE to the
service-level-AA payload received from the upper layers, and if the
service-level-AA payload type is received in the SERVICE-LEVEL
AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message from the SMF, set the service-level-AA
payload type of the Service-level-AA container IE to the
service-level-AA payload type received from the SMF.

The UE shall transport the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message
and the PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified
in subclause 5.4.5. Apart from this action, the service-level
authentication and authorization procedure initiated by the DN is
transparent to the 5GSM layer of the UE.

Upon receipt of a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message, the SMF
shall stop timer T3594 and provides the service-level-AA payload
received in the Service-level-AA container IE of the SERVICE-LEVEL
AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the DN.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2\]

If requested by the upper layers, the UE supporting UAS services shall
initiate a request to establish a PDU session for UAS services, where
the UE:

a\) shall include the service-level device ID with the value set to the
CAA-level UAV ID;

b\) if provided by the upper layers, shall include the service-level-AA
server address, with the value set to the USS address; and

c\) if provided by the upper layers, shall include:

i\) the service-level-AA payload type, with the value set to \"UUAA
payload\"; and

ii\) the service-level-AA payload, with the value set to UUAA payload,

in the Service-level-AA container IE of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REQUEST message.

If the PDU session being established is a non-emergency PDU session, the
request type is not set to \"existing PDU session\", the
Service-level-AA container IE is included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, and

> a\) the service-level authentication and authorization by the external
> DN is required due to local policy;
>
> b\) there is a valid user\'s subscription information for the
> requested DNN or for the requested DNN and S-NSSAI; and
>
> c\) the information for the service-level authentication and
> authorization by the external DN in the Service-level-AA container IE
> includes CAA-level UAV ID,

then the SMF shall proceed with the UUAA-SM procedure as specified in
3GPP TS 23.256 \[6AB\] and refrain from accepting or rejecting the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message until the service-level
authentication and authorization procedure is completed.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.3\]

If the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message includes the
Service-level-AA container IE with the service-level device ID set to
the CAA-level UAV ID, and the SMF is provided by the UAS-NF the
successful UUAA-SM result and the CAA-level UAV ID, the SMF shall store
the successful result together with the authorized CAA-level UAV ID and
transmit the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message to the UE, where
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message shall include the
Service-level-AA container IE containing:

a\) the service-level-AA response, with the SLAR field set to \"Service
level authentication and authorization was successful\";

b\) the service-level device ID with the value set to the CAA-level UAV
ID;

c\) if a payload is received from the UAS-NF, the service-level-AA
payload with the value set to the payload; and

d\) if a payload type associated with the payload is received from the
UAS-NF, the service-level-AA payload type with the values set to the
associated payload type.

NOTE 21: UAS security information can be included in the UUAA payload by
the USS as specified in 3GPP TS 33.256 \[24B\].

##### 10.1.4.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-111 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 6.3.1A.1, 6.3.1A.2, 6.3.1A.3, 6.3.2.2,
6.4.1.2, 6.4.1.3, 4.22.3 Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17
requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1A.1\]

The purpose of the service-level authentication and authorization
(service-level-AA) procedure is to enable the DN using NEF services for
authentication:

a\) to authenticate the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the
PDU session;

b\) to authorize the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the PDU
session;

c\) both of the above; or

d\) to re-authenticate the upper layers of the UE after establishment of
the PDU session.

The service-level authentication and authorization procedure are used
for UUAA as specified in TS 23.256 \[6AB\].

NOTE 1: The authentication protocol for UUAA is out of scope of 3GPP in
this release of specification.

The service-level authentication and authorization procedure can be
performed only during or after the UE-requested PDU session procedure
establishing a non-emergency PDU session. The service-level
authentication and authorization procedure shall not be performed during
or after the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
establishing an emergency PDU session.

If the service-level authentication and authorization procedure is
performed during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure:

a\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes successfully,
the service-level-AA response is transported from the network to the UE
as a part of the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure in the
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message; or

b\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes
unsuccessfully, the service-level-AA response is transported from the
network to the UE as a part of the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message.

NOTE 2: If the SMF receives the HTTP code set to "4xx" or "5xx" as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 \[20AA\] or the SMF detects a UUAA-SM
failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.256 \[21B\], then the SMF considers
that the UUAA-SM procedure has completed unsuccessfully.

If the service-level authentication and authorization procedure is
performed for the established PDU session with re-authentication
purpose:

a\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes successfully,
the service-level-AA response is transported from the network to the UE
as a part of the network-requested PDU session modification procedure in
the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message; or

b\) and the service-level-AA procedure of the UE completes
unsuccessfully, the service-level-AA response is transported from the
network to the UE as a part of the network-requested PDU session release
procedure in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.

There can be several rounds of exchange of a service-level-AA payload
for the service to complete the service-level authentication and
authorization of the request for a PDU session (see example in
figure 6.3.1A.1-1).

If the UE receives the service-level-AA response in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message or the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT
message, the UE passes it to the upper layer.

Figure 6.3.1A.1-1: Service-level authentication and authorization
procedure

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1A.2\]

In order to initiate the service-level authentication and authorization
procedure, the SMF shall create a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message.

The SMF shall set the PTI IE of the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND
message to \"No procedure transaction identity assigned\".

The SMF shall set the service-level-AA payload in the Service-level-AA
container IE of the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to the
payload provided by the DN via the NEF. If a payload type associated
with the payload is provided by the DN via the NEF, the SMF shall set
the service-level-AA payload type with the value set to the payload
type.

NOTE: In case of UUAA, the service-level-AA payload is provided by the
DN via the UAS-NF.

The SMF shall send the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message, and
the SMF shall start timer T3594 (see example in figure 6.3.1A.1-1).

Upon receipt of a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, the UE passes to the upper layers the service-level-AA
payload received in the Service-level-AA container IE of the
SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message. Apart from this action,
the service-level authentication and authorization procedure initiated
by the DN is transparent to the 5GSM layer of the UE.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.1A.2\]

When the upper layers provide a service-level-AA payload, the UE shall
create a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message and set the
service-level-AA payload of the Service-level-AA container IE to the
service-level-AA payload received from the upper layers, and if the
service-level-AA payload type is received in the SERVICE-LEVEL
AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message from the SMF, set the service-level-AA
payload type of the Service-level-AA container IE to the
service-level-AA payload type received from the SMF.

The UE shall transport the SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message
and the PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified
in subclause 5.4.5. Apart from this action, the service-level
authentication and authorization procedure initiated by the DN is
transparent to the 5GSM layer of the UE.

Upon receipt of a SERVICE-LEVEL AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message, the SMF
shall stop timer T3594 and provides the service-level-AA payload
received in the Service-level-AA container IE of the SERVICE-LEVEL
AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the DN.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.2\]

If the UE supporting UAS services requests to establish a PDU session
for C2 communication, the UE shall include the Service-level-AA
container IE in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message. In the
Service-level-AA container IE, the UE shall include:

a\) the service-level device ID with the value set to the CAA-level UAV
ID of the UE; and

b\) if available, the service-level-AA payload with the value set to the
C2 authorization payload and the service-level-AA payload type with the
value set to \"C2 authorization payload\".

NOTE 10: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload
can include the pairing information for C2 communication and the UAV
flight authorization information.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.3\]

If the network accepts the request of the PDU session establishment for
C2 communication, the network shall send the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT message including the Service-level-AA container IE containing:

a\) the service-level-AA response with the value of C2AR field set to
the \"C2 authorization was successful\";

b\) if a payload is provided from the UAS-NF, the service-level-AA
payload with the value set to the payload; and

c\) if a payload type associated with the payload is provided from the
UAS-NF, the service-level-AA payload type with the value set to the
payload type; and

d\) if the CAA-level UAV ID is provided from the UAS-NF, the
service-level device ID with the value set to the CAA-level UAV ID.

NOTE 22: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload
can include the C2 session security information.

Upon receipt of the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message of the PDU
session for C2 communication, if the Service-level-AA container IE is
included, the UE shall forward the service-level-AA contents of the
Service-level-AA container IE to the upper layers.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.2.2\]

The UE shall include the Service-level-AA container IE in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, when requesting to modify an
established PDU session for C2 communication. In the Service-level-AA
container IE, the UE shall include:

a\) the service-level device ID with the value set to the CAA-level UAV
ID of the UE; and

b\) if available, the service-level-AA payload with the value set to the
C2 authorization payload and the service-level-AA payload type with the
value set to \"C2 authorization payload\".

NOTE 3: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload can
include the pairing information for C2 communication and the UAV flight
authorization information.\[TS 24.501, clause 4.22.3\]

The 5GS supports USS authorization of C2 communication for pairing of
UAV and UAV-C. The pairing of UAV and UAV-C needs to be authorized by
USS successfully before the user plane connectivity for C2 communication
is enabled. For C2 authorization procedure, the UE supporting UAS
services provides to the network with CAA-level UAV ID.

The USS authorization of UAV flight can also be performed during the C2
authorization procedure. The UE supporting UAS services provides the UAV
flight authorization information to the network if provided by upper
layers.

NOTE 1: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload can
include the pairing information for C2 communication and the UAV flight
authorization information (see subclauses 6.4.1.2 and 6.4.2.2).

If a UE supporting UAS services uses a common PDU session for both USS
communication and C2 communication, the C2 communication can be
authorized using UUAA-SM procedure during the PDU session establishment
procedure or during the PDU session modification procedure. If the
pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the network shall disable C2
communication for the PDU session.

NOTE 2: The network can disable C2 communication for the PDU session
e.g., by removing the QoS flow for C2 communication during PDU session
modification procedure as decribed in subclauses 6.3.2.2.

If a UE supporting UAS services uses separate PDU sessions for,
respectively, USS communication and C2 communication, the C2
communication is authorized using UUAA-SM during the PDU session
establishment procedure. If the pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the
PDU session for C2 communication shall be released by the SMF.

##### (1) {#section-268 .H6}

**with** { UE in PDU SESSION ACTIVE state and in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE is requested to modify of PDU session }

**then** { UE sends a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message }

}

##### 10.1.5.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-112 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.2.1\]

The purpose of the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure is:

a\) to enable the UE to request modification of a PDU session;

b\) to indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for a PDU
session;

c\) to revoke the previously indicated support for reflective QoS;

d\) to request specific QoS handling and segregation of service data
flows;

e\) to indicate to the network the relevant 5GSM parameters and
capabilities (e.g. the UE\'s 5GSM capabilities, whether the UE supports
more than 16 packet filters, the maximum data rate per UE for user-plane
integrity protection supported by the UE for uplink and the maximum data
rate per UE for user-plane integrity protection supported by the UE for
downlink) for a PDN connection established when in S1 mode, after the
first inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the UE is
operating in single-registration mode in the network supporting N26
interface; or

f\) to delete one or more mapped EPS bearer contexts.

NOTE: The UE does not request a PDU session modification for an LADN
when the UE is located outside the LADN service area.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.2.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session modification
procedure, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST
message.

The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the
PTI IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the allocated
PTI value.

The UE shall not perform the UE-requested PDU session modification
procedure for an emergency PDU session.

The UE shall not perform the UE-requested PDU session modification
procedure for a PDU session for LADN when the UE is located outside the
LADN service area.

If the UE requests a specific QoS handling, the UE shall include the
requested QoS rules IE indicating requested QoS rules and the requested
QoS flow descriptions IE indicating requested QoS flow descriptions for
the specific QoS handling. The QoS rules IE includes the packet filters
which describe the service data flows requested by the UE. The specific
QoS parameters requested by the UE is specified in the QoS flow
descriptions IE. If the UE requests the network to bind specific service
data flows to a dedicated QoS flow, the UE shall create a new QoS rule
by setting the rule operation code to \"Create new QoS rule\" and shall
set the segregation bit to \"Segregation requested\" for the
corresponding QoS rule in the QoS rules IE. The UE shall set the QRI
values to \"no QoS rule identifier assigned\" in the requested QoS rules
IE, if the QoS rules are newly created; otherwise, the UE shall set the
QRI values to those of the existing QoS rules for which the specific QoS
handling applies. The UE shall set the QFI values to \"no QoS flow
identifier assigned\" in the requested QoS flow descriptions IE, if the
QoS flow descriptions are newly created; otherwise, the UE shall set the
QFI values to the QFIs of the existing QoS flow descriptions for which
the specific QoS handling applies.

...

If the UE is performing the PDU session modification procedure to
request the deletion of a non-default QoS rule due to errors in QoS
operations or packet filters, the UE shall include the 5GSM cause IE in
the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message as described in
subclause 6.4.1.3.

Even if the timer T3396, T3584, or T3585 is running or is deactivated,
the UE shall indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status associated
to a PDU session, by including the extended protocol configuration
options IE in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message and setting
the 3GPP PS data off UE status.

For a PDN connection established when in S1 mode, after the first
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode in the network supporting N26 interface and the
UE requests the PDU session to be an always-on PDU session in the 5GS,
the UE shall include the Always-on PDU session requested IE and set the
value of the IE to \"Always-on PDU session requested\" in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the
PDU session ID, and the request type set to \"modification request\",
using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5, and
the UE shall start timer T3581 (see example in figure 6.4.2.2.1).

otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.3.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session release procedure, the
UE shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message.

The UE may set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST
message to indicate the reason for releasing the PDU session.

The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following 5GSM cause
values:

\#36 regular deactivation;

\#41 Semantic error in the TFT operation;

\#42 Syntactical error in the TFT operation;

\#44 Semantic errors in packet filter(s);

\#45 Syntactical error in packet filter(s).

The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the
PTI IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message to the allocated PTI
value.

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and the
PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, and the UE shall start timer T3582 (see example in
figure 6.4.3.2.1).

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.3.3\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and a PDU session
ID, if the SMF accepts the request to release the PDU session, and shall
perform the network-requested PDU session release procedure as specified
in subclause 6.3.3.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.3.5\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

b\) Collision of UE-requested PDU session release procedure and
network-requested PDU session modification procedure.

When the UE receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message during
the UE-requested PDU session release procedure, and the PDU session
indicated in PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message is the PDU session
that the UE had requested to release, the UE shall ignore the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the PDU session
release procedure.

#### 10.1.6.2 UE-requested PDU session release / Abnormal / Collision with network-requested PDU session release procedure

##### 10.1.6.2.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-114 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-270 .H6}

**with** { the UE is in PDU SESSION ACTIVE state and transported the PDU
SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message }

**ensure that** {\
**when** { UE receives a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message with the
PTI IE set to "No procedure transaction identity assigned" indicating a
PDU session that UE wants to release }

**then** { the UE aborts the UE-requested PDU session release procedure
and proceeds with the network-requested PDU session release procedure }

}

##### 10.1.6.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-114 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.3.2, 6.4.3.3 and 6.4.3.5. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.3.2\]

In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session release procedure, the
UE shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message.

The UE may set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST
message to indicate the reason for releasing the PDU session.

The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following 5GSM cause
values:

\#36 regular deactivation;

\#41 Semantic error in the TFT operation;

\#42 Syntactical error in the TFT operation;

\#44 Semantic errors in packet filter(s);

\#45 Syntactical error in packet filter(s).

The UE shall allocate a PTI value currently not used and shall set the
PTI IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message to the allocated PTI
value.

The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and the
PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, and the UE shall start timer T3582 (see example in
figure 6.4.3.2.1).

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.3.3\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and a PDU session
ID, if the SMF accepts the request to release the PDU session, and shall
perform the network-requested PDU session release procedure as specified
in subclause 6.3.3.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.3.5\]

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

...

c\) Collision of UE-requested PDU session release procedure and
network-requested PDU session release procedure.

When the UE receives a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message with the PTI
IE set to \"No procedure transaction identity assigned\" during the
UE-requested PDU session release procedure, and the PDU session
indicated in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is the same as the
PDU session that the UE requests to release, the UE shall abort the
UE-requested PDU session release procedure and proceed with the
network-requested PDU session release procedure.

##### 10.1.8.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-115 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4\]

If:

\- the 5GSM cause value \#69 \"insufficient resources for specific
slice\" and the Back-off timer value IE are included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message; or

\- an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to S-NSSAI
only based congestion control is received along a Back-off timer value
and a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID
IE set to the PDU session ID of the PDU session;

the UE shall take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3585 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a
UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.2.8):

a\) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and no S-NSSAI
was provided during the PDU session establishment and the request type
was different from \"initial emergency request\" and different from
\"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop timer T3585
associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE shall then start
timer T3585 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified
in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same
S-NSSAI that was sent by the UE, until timer T3585 expires or timer
T3585 is stopped; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until timer T3585
expires or timer T3585 is stopped.

The UE shall not stop timer T3585 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b\) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same S-NSSAI
until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives
a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU
session for the same S-NSSAI from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message including 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for
the same S-NSSAI from the network; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU session established
without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
messages including 5GSM cause IE set to 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation
requested\" for a non-emergency PDU session established without an
S-NSSAI provided by the UE.

The timer T3585 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c\) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

1\) shall stop timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if
running, and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI; and

2\) if no S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request \" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI, if running, and may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI, or another
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI provided by
the UE.

If the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE set to \"The back-off
timer is applied in all PLMNs\" is included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value \#69
\"insufficient resources for specific slice\", then the UE shall apply
the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs. Otherwise, the UE shall apply the
timer T3585 for the registered PLMN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included or no Back-off timer
value is received from the 5GMM sublayer, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI or without an S-NSSAI.

When the timer T3585 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

If the timer T3585 is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3585 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3585 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall
behave as follows:

let t1 be the time remaining for T3585 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

NOTE 2: As described in this subclause, upon PLMN change or inter-system
change, the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T3585. This means the
timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the
given 5GSM procedure, the PLMN, the S-NSSAI and optionally the DNN
combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs
inter-system change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same
S-NSSAI and optionally the same DNN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3584 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI,
a DNN, and old PLMN, but T3584 is not running and is not deactivated for
the S-NSSAI, the DNN, and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI and the same
DNN in the new PLMN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3585 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI
and old PLMN, but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the
S-NSSAI and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI in the new PLMN.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4\]

If:

\- the 5GSM cause value \#69 \"insufficient resources for specific
slice\" and the Back-off timer value IE are included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message; or

\- an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to S-NSSAI
only based congestion control is received along a Back-off timer value
and a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID
IE set to the PDU session ID of the PDU session;

the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network,
if any, and take different actions depending on the timer value received
for timer T3585 in the Back-off timer value IE or depending on the
Back-off timer value received from the 5GMM sublayer (if the UE is a UE
configured for high priority access in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.2.8):

a\) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and no S-NSSAI
was provided during the PDU session establishment and the request type
was different from \"initial emergency request\" and different from
\"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop timer T3585
associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The timer T3585 to be
stopped includes the timer T3585 applied for all the PLMNs, if running,
and the timer T3585 applied for the registered PLMN, if running. The UE
shall then start timer T3585 with the value provided in the Back-off
timer value IE or with the Back-off timer value received from the 5GMM
sublayer and:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified
in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same
S-NSSAI that was sent by the UE, until timer T3585 expires or timer
T3585 is stopped; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until timer T3585
expires or timer T3585 is stopped.

The UE shall not stop timer T3585 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b\) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The timer T3585
to be stopped includes the timer T3585 applied for all the PLMNs, if
running, and the timer T3585 applied for the registered PLMN, if
running. The UE:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same S-NSSAI
until the UE is switched off, the USIM is removed, the entry in the
\"list of subscriber data\" for the current SNPN is updated if the UE
does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, or the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is
updated if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU session for the same S-NSSAI
from the network, or a PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message for a
non-emergency PDU session for the same S-NSSAI from the network, or a
PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message without the Back-off timer value IE
for the same S-NSSAI from the network; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until the UE is
switched off, the USIM is removed, the entry in the \"list of subscriber
data\" for the current SNPN is updated if the UE does not support access
to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, or the selected
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is updated if the UE supports
access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, or the UE
receives a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, or a PDU
SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU session
established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, or a PDU SESSION
RELEASE COMMAND message without the Back-off timer value IE for a
non-emergency PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the
UE.

The timer T3585 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c\) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

1\) shall stop timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI
(including the timer T3585 applied for all the PLMNs, if running, and
the timer T3585 applied for the registered PLMN, if running), if
running, and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI; and

2\) if no S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request \" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI, if running, and may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI (including
the timer T3585 applied for all the PLMNs, if running, and the timer
T3585 applied for the registered PLMN, if running), or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI provided by the
UE.

If the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE with the ABO bit set to
\"The back-off timer is applied in all PLMNs\" is included in the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value \#69
\"insufficient resources for specific slice\", then the UE shall apply
the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs. Otherwise, the UE shall apply the
timer T3585 for the registered PLMN. Additionally, if the 5GSM
congestion re-attempt indicator IE with the CATBO bit set to \"The
back-off timer is applied in the current access type\" is included in
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value
\#69 \"insufficient resources for specific slice\", then the UE shall
apply the timer T3585 for the current access type. Otherwise, the UE
shall apply the timer T3585 for both 3GPP access type and non-3GPP
access type.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included or no Back-off timer
value is received from the 5GMM sublayer, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI or without an S-NSSAI.

When the timer T3585 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

If the timer T3585 is running when the UE enters state
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE
(if any) remains the same and the entry in the \"list of subscriber
data\" to which timer T3585 is associated (if any) is not updated, then
timer T3585 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3585 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE (if any) remains the same and the entry in the \"list of
subscriber data\" to which timer T3585 is associated (if any) is not
updated when the UE is switched on, the UE shall behave as follows:

let t1 be the time remaining for T3585 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

NOTE: As described in this subclause, upon PLMN change or inter-system
change, the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T3585. This means the
timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the
given 5GSM procedure, the PLMN, the S-NSSAI and optionally the DNN
combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs
inter-system change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same
S-NSSAI and optionally the same DNN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3584 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI,
a DNN, and old PLMN, but T3584 is not running and is not deactivated for
the S-NSSAI, the DNN, and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI and the same
DNN in the new PLMN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3585 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI
and old PLMN, but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the
S-NSSAI and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI in the new PLMN.

##### 10.1.8.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-117 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4\]

If:

\- the 5GSM cause value \#69 \"insufficient resources for specific
slice\" and the Back-off timer value IE are included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message; or

\- an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to S-NSSAI
only based congestion control is received along a Back-off timer value
and a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID
IE set to the PDU session ID of the PDU session;

the UE shall take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3585 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a
UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.2.8):

a\) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and no S-NSSAI
was provided during the PDU session establishment and the request type
was different from \"initial emergency request\" and different from
\"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop timer T3585
associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE shall then start
timer T3585 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified
in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same
S-NSSAI that was sent by the UE, until timer T3585 expires or timer
T3585 is stopped; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until timer T3585
expires or timer T3585 is stopped.

The UE shall not stop timer T3585 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b\) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same S-NSSAI
until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives
a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU
session for the same S-NSSAI from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message including 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for
the same S-NSSAI from the network; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU session established
without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
messages including 5GSM cause IE set to 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation
requested\" for a non-emergency PDU session established without an
S-NSSAI provided by the UE.

The timer T3585 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c\) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

1\) shall stop timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if
running, and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI; and

2\) if no S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request \" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI, if running, and may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI, or another
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI provided by
the UE.

If the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE set to \"The back-off
timer is applied in all PLMNs\" is included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value \#69
\"insufficient resources for specific slice\", then the UE shall apply
the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs. Otherwise, the UE shall apply the
timer T3585 for the registered PLMN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included or no Back-off timer
value is received from the 5GMM sublayer, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI or without an S-NSSAI.

When the timer T3585 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

If the timer T3585 is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3585 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3585 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall
behave as follows:

let t1 be the time remaining for T3585 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

NOTE 2: As described in this subclause, upon PLMN change or inter-system
change, the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T3585. This means the
timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the
given 5GSM procedure, the PLMN, the S-NSSAI and optionally the DNN
combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs
inter-system change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same
S-NSSAI and optionally the same DNN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3584 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI,
a DNN, and old PLMN, but T3584 is not running and is not deactivated for
the S-NSSAI, the DNN, and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI and the same
DNN in the new PLMN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3585 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI
and old PLMN, but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the
S-NSSAI and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI in the new PLMN.

}

##### 10.1.8.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-118 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.4.5.3.2, 5.4.5.3.3, and 6.4.1.4.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.5.3.2\]

In 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF initiates the NAS transport procedure by
sending the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, as shown in figure 5.4.5.3.2.1.

...

In case h4) in subclause 5.4.5.3.1, i.e. upon sending a single uplink
5GSM message which was not forwarded, because the maximum number of UEs
for a network slice has been reached, the AMF shall:

a\) include the PDU session ID in the PDU session ID IE;

b\) set the Payload container type IE to \"N1 SM information\";

c\) set the Payload container IE to the 5GSM message which was not
forwarded;

d\) set the 5GMM cause IE to the 5GMM cause \#69 \"insufficient
resources for specific slice\"; and

e\) include the Back-off timer value IE.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.5.3.3\]

Upon reception of a DL NAS TRANSPORT message, the UE shall stop the
timer T3346 if running.

Upon reception of a DL NAS TRANSPORT message, if the Payload container
type IE is set to:

...

g\) \"N1 SM information\" and:

1\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#22 \"Congestion\", the
UE passes to the 5GSM sublayer an indication that the 5GSM message was
not forwarded due to DNN based congestion control along with the 5GSM
message from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message,
and the time value from the Back-off timer value IE;

2\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#28 \"Restricted service
area\", the UE passes to the 5GSM sublayer an indication that the 5GSM
message was not forwarded due to service area restrictions along with
the 5GSM message from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT
message, enters the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE and, if
the DL NAS TRANSPORT message is received over 3GPP access, performs the
registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update
without waiting for the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection (see
subclauses 5.3.5 and 5.5.1.3);

3\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#65 \"maximum number of
PDU sessions reached\", the UE passes to the 5GSM sublayer an indication
that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because the PLMN\'s maximum
number of PDU sessions has been reached, along with the 5GSM message
from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message;

4\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#67 \"insufficient
resources for specific slice and DNN\", the UE passes to the 5GSM
sublayer an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to
S-NSSAI and DNN based congestion control along with the 5GSM message
from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, and the
time value from the Back-off timer value IE;

5\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#69 \"insufficient

indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to S-NSSAI only
based congestion control along with the 5GSM message from the Payload
container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, and the time value from
the Back-off timer value IE;

5a) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#78 \"PLMN not allowed
to operate at the present UE location\", the UE passes to the 5GSM
sublayer an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because
the UE is registered to a PLMN via a satellite NG-RAN cell that is not
allowed to operate at the present UE location along with the 5GSM
message from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message.
Additionally, the UE shall not send the UL NAS TRANSPORT message to
transport any of the data types listed in subclause 5.4.5.2.1;

6\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#90 \"payload was not
forwarded\", the UE passes to the 5GSM sublayer an indication that the
5GSM message was not forwarded due to routing failure along with the
5GSM message from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT
message;

7\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#91 \"DNN not supported
or not subscribed in the slice\", the UE passes to the 5GSM sublayer an
indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded because the DNN is
not supported or not subscribed in a slice along with the 5GSM message
from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, and the
time value from the Back-off timer value IE, if any;

8\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#92 \"insufficient
user-plane resources for the PDU session\", the UE passes to the 5GSM
sublayer an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to
insufficient user-plane resources along with the 5GSM message from the
Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message.

9\) the 5GMM cause IE is set to the 5GMM cause \#79 \"UAS services not
allowed\", the UE passes to the 5GSM sublayer an indication that the
5GSM message was not forwarded because the UE is marked in the UE\'s
5GMM context that it is not allowed to request UAS services along with
the 5GSM message from the Payload container IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT
message.\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4\]

If:

\- the 5GSM cause value \#69 \"insufficient resources for specific
slice\" and the Back-off timer value IE are included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message; or

\- an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to S-NSSAI
only based congestion control is received along a Back-off timer value
and a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID
IE set to the PDU session ID of the PDU session;

the UE shall take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3585 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a
UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.2.8):

a\) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and no S-NSSAI
was provided during the PDU session establishment and the request type
was different from \"initial emergency request\" and different from
\"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop timer T3585
associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE shall then start
timer T3585 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified
in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same
S-NSSAI that was sent by the UE, until timer T3585 expires or timer
T3585 is stopped; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until timer T3585
expires or timer T3585 is stopped.

The UE shall not stop timer T3585 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b\) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same S-NSSAI
until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives
a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU
session for the same S-NSSAI from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message including 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for
the same S-NSSAI from the network; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU session established
without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
messages including 5GSM cause IE set to 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation
requested\" for a non-emergency PDU session established without an
S-NSSAI provided by the UE.

The timer T3585 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c\) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

1\) shall stop timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if
running, and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI; and

2\) if no S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request \" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI, if running, and may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI, or another
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI provided by
the UE.

If the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE set to \"The back-off
timer is applied in all PLMNs\" is included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value \#69
\"insufficient resources for specific slice\", then the UE shall apply
the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs. Otherwise, the UE shall apply the
timer T3585 for the registered PLMN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included or no Back-off timer
value is received from the 5GMM sublayer, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI or without an S-NSSAI.

When the timer T3585 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

If the timer T3585 is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3585 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3585 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall
behave as follows:

let t1 be the time remaining for T3585 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

NOTE 2: As described in this subclause, upon PLMN change or inter-system
change, the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T3585. This means the
timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the
given 5GSM procedure, the PLMN, the S-NSSAI and optionally the DNN
combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs
inter-system change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same
S-NSSAI and optionally the same DNN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3584 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI,
a DNN, and old PLMN, but T3584 is not running and is not deactivated for
the S-NSSAI, the DNN, and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI and the same
DNN in the new PLMN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3585 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI
and old PLMN, but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the
S-NSSAI and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI in the new PLMN.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 5.4.3.2 and 6.4.1.4. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 5.4.5.3.2\]

In 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF initiates the NAS transport procedure by
sending the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, as shown in figure 5.4.5.3.2.1.

...

In case h4) in subclause 5.4.5.3.1, i.e. upon sending a single uplink
5GSM message which was not forwarded, because the maximum number of UEs
for a network slice has been reached, the AMF shall:

a\) include the PDU session ID in the PDU session ID IE;

b\) set the Payload container type IE to \"N1 SM information\";

c\) set the Payload container IE to the 5GSM message which was not
forwarded;

d\) set the 5GMM cause IE to the 5GMM cause \#69 \"insufficient
resources for specific slice\"; and

e\) include the Back-off timer value IE.

...

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.4.1.4\]

...

If:

\- the 5GSM cause value \#69 \"insufficient resources for specific
slice\" and the Back-off timer value IE are included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message; or

\- an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to S-NSSAI
only based congestion control is received along a Back-off timer value
and a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message with the PDU session ID
IE set to the PDU session ID of the PDU session;

the UE shall take different actions depending on the timer value
received for timer T3585 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a
UE configured for high priority access in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in subclause 6.2.8):

a\) If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and no S-NSSAI
was provided during the PDU session establishment and the request type
was different from \"initial emergency request\" and different from
\"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop timer T3585
associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE shall then start
timer T3585 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified
in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same
S-NSSAI that was sent by the UE, until timer T3585 expires or timer
T3585 is stopped; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until timer T3585
expires or timer T3585 is stopped.

The UE shall not stop timer T3585 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b\) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and an
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if it is running.
If the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated and no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI if it is running. The UE:

1\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
with request type different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", or another PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency PDU session for the same S-NSSAI
until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives
a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU
session for the same S-NSSAI from the network or a PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message including 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for
the same S-NSSAI from the network; and

2\) shall not send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
without an S-NSSAI and with request type different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", or another PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in subclause 6.4.2.1, for a non-emergency
PDU session established without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, if no
S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", until the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives a PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message for a non-emergency PDU session established
without an S-NSSAI provided by the UE, or a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
messages including 5GSM cause IE set to 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation
requested\" for a non-emergency PDU session established without an
S-NSSAI provided by the UE.

The timer T3585 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c\) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

1\) shall stop timer T3585 associated with the corresponding S-NSSAI, if
running, and may send another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message
or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI; and

2\) if no S-NSSAI was provided during the PDU session establishment and
the request type was different from \"initial emergency request \" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop
timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI, if running, and may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI, or another
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message without an S-NSSAI provided by
the UE.

If the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE set to \"The back-off
timer is applied in all PLMNs\" is included in the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message with the 5GSM cause value \#69
\"insufficient resources for specific slice\", then the UE shall apply
the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs. Otherwise, the UE shall apply the
timer T3585 for the registered PLMN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included or no Back-off timer
value is received from the 5GMM sublayer, then the UE may send another
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI or without an S-NSSAI.

When the timer T3585 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for emergency
services.

If the timer T3585 is running when the UE enters state5GMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3585 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3585 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall
behave as follows:

let t1 be the time remaining for T3585 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 -- t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

NOTE 2: As described in this subclause, upon PLMN change or inter-system
change, the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T3585. This means the
timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the
given 5GSM procedure, the PLMN, the S-NSSAI and optionally the DNN
combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs
inter-system change back from S1 mode to N1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same
S-NSSAI and optionally the same DNN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3584 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI,
a DNN, and old PLMN, but T3584 is not running and is not deactivated for
the S-NSSAI, the DNN, and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI and the same
DNN in the new PLMN.

Upon PLMN change, if T3585 is running or is deactivated for an S-NSSAI
and old PLMN, but T3585 is not running and is not deactivated for the
S-NSSAI and new PLMN, then the UE is allowed to send a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for the same S-NSSAI in the new PLMN.

message and enters BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE state }

}

##### 10.2.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-120 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.301, clause 6.4.1.3, 8.3.6.17and 9.9.4.29. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.4.1.3\]

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
if the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection,
the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the APN provided by
the UE. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the
PDN connection and the request type was different from \"emergency\" and
from \"handover of emergency bearer services\", the UE shall stop the
timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. If the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received in response to a
request for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the timer
T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. For any case, the UE
shall then send an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message
and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. When the default bearer is
activated as part of the attach procedure, the UE shall send the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message together with ATTACH
COMPLETE message. When the default bearer is activated as the response
to the stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE shall send
the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message alone.

If a WLAN offload indication information element is included in the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store
the WLAN offload acceptability values for this PDN connection and use
the E-UTRAN offload acceptability value to determine whether this PDN
connection is offloadable to WLAN or not.

The UE checks the PTI in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message to identify the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to which
the default bearer context activation is related (see subclause 6.5.1).

If the UE receives a serving PLMN rate control IE in the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the
serving PLMN rate control IE value and use the stored serving PLMN rate
control value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink User data container
IEs included in ESM DATA TRANSPORT messages for the corresponding PDN
connection in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 \[10\].

If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the
protocol configuration options IE or extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE shall store the APN rate control parameters value and use the
stored APN rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed limit of
uplink user data related to the APN indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in accordance with
3GPP TS 23.401 \[10\]. If the UE has a previously stored APN rate
control parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored
APN rate control parameters value for this APN with the received APN
rate control parameters value.

If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for
exception data container in the protocol configuration options IE or
extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional APN
rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the
maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data related to the APN
indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 \[10\]. If the UE has a previously stored
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value for this
APN, the UE shall replace the stored additional APN rate control
parameters for exception data value for this APN with the received
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value.

If the UE receives non-IP Link MTU parameter or IPv4 Link MTU parameter
of the protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall pass the received Non-IP
Link MTU or IPv4 Link MTU to the upper layer.

NOTE: The Non-IP Link MTU and the IPv4 Link MTU size correspond to the
maximum length of user data that can be sent either in the user data
container in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message or via S1-U interface.

If the UE receives a session-AMBR and QoS rule(s), which correspond to
the default EPS bearer of the PDN connectivity being activated, in the
protocol configuration options IE or the extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE stores the session-AMBR and QoS rule(s) for use during
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message,
the MME shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE and stop the timer
T3485, if the timer is running. If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
included a low priority indicator set to \"MS is configured for NAS
signalling low priority\", the MME shall store the NAS signalling low
priority indication within the default EPS bearer context.

\[TS 24.301, clause 8.3.6.17\]

This IE shall be included in the message only if the network wishes to
transmit the APN-AMBR values to the UE for possible uplink policy
enforcement and at least one of the values to be transmitted exceeds the
maximum value specified in the APN aggregate maximum bit rate
information element in subclause 9.9.4.2.

\[TS 24.301, clause 9.9.4.29\]

The purpose of the extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information
element is to indicate the initial subscribed APN-AMBR with a value
higher than 65280 Mbps when the UE establishes a PDN connection or to
indicate the new APN-AMBR with a value higher than 65280 Mbps if it is
changed by the network.

The receiving entity shall ignore the bit rate values which are included
in the extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element and
not higher than 65280 Mbps.

The extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element is coded
as shown in figure 9.9.4.29.1 and table 9.9.4.29.1.

The extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate is a type 4 information
element with a length of 8 octets.

##### 10.2.1.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-121 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.301, clauses 6.4.2.3, 6.4.3.1, 6.4.3.2, 6.4.3.3,
8.3.3.11, 9.9.4.29 and 9.9.4.30. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.4.2.3\]

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message, if the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396, if it is running for the APN
provided by the UE. If the UE did not provide an APN for the
establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different
from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\",
the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is
running. If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
was received for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the
timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. For any case, the
UE shall then check the received TFT before taking it into use, send an
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message and enter the state
BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. The ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message shall include the EPS bearer identity.

The linked EPS bearer identity included in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message indicates to the UE to which default
bearer, IP address and PDN the dedicated bearer is linked.

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a
PTI value other than \"no procedure transaction identity assigned\" and
\"reserved\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[12\]), the UE uses the PTI to
identify the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure to which the dedicated
bearer context activation is related.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.4.3.1\]

The purpose of the EPS bearer context modification procedure is to
modify an EPS bearer context with a specific QoS and TFT, or
re-negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS
bearer context. The EPS bearer context modification procedure is
initiated by the network, but it may also be initiated as part of the UE
requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested
bearer resource modification procedure.

The network may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification
procedure to update the APN-AMBR of the UE, for instance after an
inter-system handover. See 3GPP TS 23.401 \[10\] annex E.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.4.3.2\]

The MME shall initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure by
sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE, starting
the timer T3486, and entering the state BEARER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING
(see example in figure 6.4.3.2.1).

The MME shall include an EPS bearer identity that identifies the EPS
bearer context to be modified in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.4.3.3\]

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the UE
provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection, the UE
shall stop timer T3396, if it is running for the APN provided by the UE.
If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection and the request type was different from \"emergency\" and
from \"handover of emergency bearer services\", the UE shall stop the
timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. If the MODIFY EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received for an emergency PDN
connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN
if it is running. For any case, the UE shall then check the received TFT
before taking it into use and send a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message to the MME.

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value
other than \"no procedure transaction identity assigned\" and
\"reserved\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[12\]), the UE uses the PTI to
identify the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure to which the EPS bearer
context modification is related (see subclause 6.5.3 and
subclause 6.5.4).

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value
other than \"no procedure transaction identity assigned\" and
\"reserved\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[12\]) and the PTI is associated to a
UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or a UE requested
bearer resource modification procedure, the UE shall release the traffic
flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value provided.

...

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MME
shall stop the timer T3486 and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE.

\[TS 24.301, clause 8.3.3.11\]

This IE shall be included in the message only if the network wishes to
transmit the maximum and guaranteed bit rate values to the UE and at
least one of the values to be transmitted exceeds the maximum value
specified in the EPS quality of service information element in
subclause 9.9.4.3

\[TS 24.301, clause 9.9.4.29\]

The purpose of the extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information
element is to indicate the initial subscribed APN-AMBR with a value
higher than 65280 Mbps when the UE establishes a PDN connection or to
indicate the new APN-AMBR with a value higher than 65280 Mbps if it is
changed by the network.

The receiving entity shall ignore the bit rate values which are included
in the extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element and
not higher than 65280 Mbps.

The extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element is coded
as shown in figure 9.9.4.29.1 and table 9.9.4.29.1.

The extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate is a type 4 information
element with a length of 8 octets

\[TS 24.301, clause 9.9.4.30\]

The purpose of the Extended EPS quality of service information element
is to indicate for an EPS bearer context the maximum bit rates for
uplink and downlink and the guaranteed bit rates for uplink and
downlink, if at least one of the bit rates has a value higher than 10
Gbps.

The Extended EPS quality of service information element is coded as
shown in figure 9.9.4.30.1 and table 9.9.4.30.1. For uplink and
downlink, if sending entity only has to indicate one bit rate (i.e.,
with a value higher than 10 Gbps), it shall encode the other bit rate
(i.e., with a value smaller or equal to 10 Gbps) as \"00000000\". The
receiving entity shall ignore the bit rate which is included in the
extended quality of service information element and has a value smaller
or equal to 10 Gbps.

##### 10.2.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-122 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.301, clauses 6.4.2.3, 6.5.3.2, 6.5.3.3, 6.5.4.2,
6.5.4.3, 8.3.8, 8.3.10 and 9.9.4.30. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.4.2.3\]

The linked EPS bearer identity included in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message indicates to the UE to which default
bearer, IP address and PDN the dedicated bearer is linked.

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a
PTI value other than \"no procedure transaction identity assigned\" and
\"reserved\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 \[12\]), the UE uses the PTI to
identify the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure to which the dedicated
bearer context activation is related.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.5.3.2\]

In order to request the allocation of bearer resources for one traffic
flow aggregate, the UE shall send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
message to the MME, start timer T3480 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.5.3.2.1).

The UE shall include the EPS bearer identity of the default EPS bearer
associated with the requested bearer resource in the Linked EPS bearer
identity IE. The UE shall set the TFT operation code in the Traffic flow
aggregate IE to \"Create new TFT\". The packet filters in the Traffic
flow aggregate IE shall include at least one packet filter applicable
for the uplink direction. In the Required traffic flow QoS IE, the UE
shall indicate a QCI and, if the UE also includes a GBR, the additional
GBR required for the traffic flow aggregate.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.5.3.3\]

If the bearer resource allocation requested is accepted by the network,
the MME shall initiate either a dedicated EPS bearer context activation
procedure or an EPS bearer context modification procedure. Upon receipt
of an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message with a PTI which matches the value used for the
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer
T3480 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The UE should
ensure that the procedure transaction identity (PTI) assigned to this
procedure is not released immediately. The way to achieve this is
implementation dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE
regards any received ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or
MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a
network retransmission (see subclause 7.3.1).

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is
received, the UE shall verify that the EPS bearer identity given in the
EPS bearer identity IE is not already used by any EPS bearer context.
The UE shall then proceed as described in subclause 6.4.2.3 or subclause
6.4.2.4.

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.5.4.2\]

In order to request the modification of bearer resources for one traffic
flow aggregate, the UE shall send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
message to the MME, start timer T3481 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.5.4.2.1).

\[TS 24.301, clause 6.5.4.3\]

Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the
MME checks whether the resources requested by the UE can be established,
modified or released by verifying the EPS bearer identity given in the
EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE.

If the bearer resource modification requested is accepted by the
network, the MME shall initiate either a dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure, an EPS bearer context modification procedure or an
EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message with a PTI which matches the value used for the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer T3481 and enter
the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The UE should ensure that the
procedure transaction identity (PTI) assigned to this procedure is not
released immediately. The way to achieve this is implementation
dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any
received ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a network
retransmission (see subclause 7.3.1).

i\) If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is
received, the UE shall verify that the EPS bearer identity given in the
EPS bearer identity IE is not already used by any EPS bearer context.
The UE shall then proceed as described in subclause 6.4.2.3 or
subclause 6.4.2.4.

\[TS 24.301, clause 8.3.8\]

This IE shall be included in the message only if the UE wishes to
transmit the maximum and guaranteed bit rate values to the network and
at least one of the values to be transmitted exceeds the maximum value
specified in the EPS quality of service information element in
subclause 9.9.4.3.

\[TS 24.301, clause 8.3.10\]

This IE shall be included in the message only if the UE wishes to
transmit the maximum and guaranteed bit rate values to the network and
at least one of the values to be transmitted exceeds the maximum value
specified in the EPS quality of service information element in
subclause 9.9.4.3.

\[TS 24.301, clause 9.9.4.30\]

The purpose of the Extended quality of service information element is to
indicate for an EPS bearer context the maximum bit rates for uplink and
downlink and the guaranteed bit rates for uplink and downlink, if at
least one of the bit rates has a value higher than 10 Gbps.

The Extended quality of service information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.4.30.1 and table 9.9.4.30.1. For uplink and downlink, if the
sending entity only has to indicate one bit rate (i.e., with a value
higher than 10 Gbps), it shall encode the other bit rate (i.e., with a
value smaller or equal to 10 Gbps) as \"00000000\". The receiving entity
shall ignore a bit rate which is included in the extended quality of
service information element and has a value smaller or equal to 10 Gbps.

The Extended quality of service is a type 4 information element with a
length of 12 octets.

##### 10.3.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-124 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 24.501, clauses 6.3.2.2, 6.3.2.4. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.2.2\]

In order to initiate the network-requested PDU session modification
procedure, the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND
message.

If the authorized QoS rules of the PDU session is modified, the SMF
shall set the authorized QoS rules IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message to the authorized QoS rules of the PDU session. The SMF
shall ensure that the number of the packet filters used in the
authorized QoS rules of the PDU Session does not exceed the maximum
number of packet filters supported by the UE for the PDU session. The
SMF may bind service data flows for which the UE has requested traffic
segregation to a dedicated QoS flow for the PDU session, if possible.
Otherwise the SMF may bind the service data flows to an existing QoS
flow. The SMF shall use only one dedicated QoS flow for traffic
segregation. If the UE has requested traffic segregation for multiple
service data flows with different QoS handling, the SMF shall bind all
these service data flows to a single QoS flow. If the SMF allows traffic
segregation for service data flows in a QoS rule, then the SMF shall
create a new authorized QoS rule for these service data flows and shall
delete packet filters corresponding to these service data flows from the
other authorized QoS rules.

If the authorized QoS flow descriptions of the PDU session is modified,
the SMF shall set the authorized QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the authorized QoS flow
descriptions of the PDU session.

If SMF creates a new authorized QoS rule for a new QoS flow, then SMF
shall include the authorized QoS flow description for that QoS flow in
the authorized QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message, if:

a\) the newly created authorized QoS rules is for a new GBR QoS flow;

b\) the QFI of the new QoS flow is not the same as the 5QI of the QoS
flow identified by the QFI; or

c\) the new QoS flow can be mapped to an EPS bearer as specified in
subclause 4.11.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\].

If the session-AMBR of the PDU session is modified, the SMF shall set
the selected Session-AMBR IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND
message to the session-AMBR of the PDU session.

If interworking with EPS is supported for the PDU session and if the
mapped EPS bearer contexts of the PDU session is modified, the SMF shall
set the mapped EPS bearer contexts IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message to the mapped EPS bearer contexts of the PDU session. If
the association between a QoS flow and the mapped EPS bearer context is
changed, the SMF shall set the EPS bearer identity parameter in
authorized QoS flow descriptions IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND message to the new EPS bearer identity associated with the QoS
flow.

If the network-requested PDU session modification procedure is triggered
by a UE-requested PDU session modification procedure and the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message includes a 5GSM capability IE, the SMF
shall:

a\) if the RQoS bit is set to:

1\) \"Reflective QoS supported\", consider that the UE supports
reflective QoS for this PDU session; or

2\) \"Reflective QoS not supported\", consider that the UE does not
support reflective QoS for this PDU session; and;

b\) if the MH6-PDU bit is set to:

1\) \"Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session supported\", consider that this PDU
session is supported to use multiple IPv6 prefixes; or

2\) \"Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session not supported\", consider that this
PDU session is not supported to use multiple IPv6 prefixes.

If the SMF considers that reflective QoS is supported for QoS flows
belonging to this PDU session, the SMF may include the RQ timer IE set
to an RQ timer value in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message.

If the network-requested PDU session modification procedure is triggered
by a UE-requested PDU session modification procedure, the PDU session
type is \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\", \"IPv4v6\" or \"Ethernet\" and the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message includes a Maximum number of
supported packet filters IE, the SMF shall consider this number as the
maximum number of packet filters that can be supported by the UE for
this PDU session. Otherwise the SMF considers that the UE supports 16
packet filters for this PDU session.

For a PDN connection established when in S1 mode, upon the first
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the network-requested
PDU session modification procedure is triggered by a UE-requested PDU
session modification procedure, the SMF shall consider that the maximum
data rate per UE for user-plane integrity protection supported by the UE
for uplink and the maximum data rate per UE for user-plane integrity
protection supported by the UE for downlink are valid for the lifetime
of the PDU session.

For a PDN connection established when in S1 mode, upon the first
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the network-requested
PDU session modification procedure is triggered by a UE-requested PDU
session modification procedure and the SMF determines, based on local
policies or configurations in the SMF and the Always-on PDU session
requested IE in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message (if
available), that either:

a\) the requested PDU session needs to be an always-on PDU session, the
SMF shall include the Always-on PDU session indication IE in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and shall set the value to
\"Always-on PDU session required\"; or

b\) the requested PDU session shall not be an always-on PDU session and:

i\) if the UE included the Always-on PDU session requested IE, the SMF
shall include the Always-on PDU session indication IE in the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message and shall set the value to \"Always-on PDU
session not allowed\"; or

ii\) if the UE did not include the Always-on PDU session requested IE,
the SMF shall not include the Always-on PDU session indication IE in the
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message.

If the value of the RQ timer is set to \"deactivated\" or has a value of
zero, the UE considers that RQoS is not applied for this PDU session and
remove the derived QoS rule(s) associated with the PDU session, if any.

If the network-requested PDU session modification procedure is triggered
by a UE-requested PDU session modification procedure, the SMF shall set
the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to the PTI of
the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message received as part of the
UE-requested PDU session modification procedure.

If the network-requested PDU session modification procedure is not
triggered by a UE-requested PDU session modification procedure, the SMF
shall set the PTI IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message to
\"No procedure transaction identity assigned\".

If the selected SSC mode of the PDU session is \"SSC mode 3\" and the
SMF requests the relocation of SSC mode 3 PDU session anchor with
multiple PDU sessions as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\], the SMF
shall include 5GSM cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" , in the PDU
SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message, and may include the PDU session
address lifetime in a PDU session address lifetime PCO parameter in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND message.

The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message, and the
SMF shall start timer T3591 (see example in figure 6.3.2.2.1).

NOTE: If the SMF requests the relocation of SSC mode 3 PDU session
anchor with multiple PDU sessions as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[9\],
the reallocation requested indication indicating whether the SMF is to
be reallocated or the SMF is to be reused is provided to the AMF.

Figure 6.3.2.2.1: Network-requested PDU session modification procedure

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.2.4\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and a PDU
session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.5, if the UE rejects the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND
message, the UE shall create a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND REJECT
message.

If the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message contains the PTI value
allocated in the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure, the UE
shall release the PTI indicated by the PTI IE and shall stop the timer
T3581.

The UE shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND REJECT message to indicate the reason for rejecting the PDU
session modification.

The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following 5GSM cause
values:

\#26 insufficient resources;

\#43 invalid PDU session identity;

\#44 semantic error in packet filter(s);

\#45 syntactical error in packet filter(s);

\#83 semantic error in the QoS operation; or

\#84 syntactical error in the QoS operation.

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are

stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.2\]

In order to initiate the network-requested PDU session release
procedure, the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message.

The SMF shall set the SM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
message to indicate the reason for releasing the PDU session.

The SM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause
values:

\#26 insufficient resources;

...

The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause value \#26 \"insufficient
resources\" is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message. If
the 5GSM cause value is \#26 \"insufficient resources\" and the PDU
SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is sent to a UE configured for high
priority access in selected PLMN or the request type was set to
\"initial emergency request\" or \"existing emergency PDU session\" for
the establishment of the PDU session, the network shall not include a
Back-off timer value IE.

The SMF may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message when the 5GSM cause value \#67 \"insufficient resources
for specific slice and DNN\" is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message. If the 5GSM cause value is \#67 \"insufficient
resources for specific slice and DNN\" and the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message is sent to a UE configured for high priority access in
selected PLMN or the request type was set to \"initial emergency
request\" or \"existing emergency PDU session\" for the establishment of
the PDU session, the network shall not include a Back-off timer value
IE.

\[TS 24.501, clause 6.3.3.3\]

Upon receipt of a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and a PDU session
ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.5,
the UE considers the PDU session as released and the UE shall create a
PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message contains the PTI value
allocated in the UE-requested PDU session release procedure, the UE
shall stop the timer T3582. The UE should ensure that the PTI value
assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.

NOTE 1: The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. For
example, the UE can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure
is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default
value of timer T3592.

While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any received PDU
SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message with the same PTI value as a network
retransmission (see subclause 7.3.1).

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\", then after completion of the
network-requested PDU session release procedure, the UE should
re-initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure as
specified in subclause 6.4.1 for:

a\) the PDU session type associated with the released PDU session;

b\) the SSC mode associated with the released PDU session;

c\) the DNN associated with the released PDU session; and

d\) the S-NSSAI associated with (if available in roaming scenarios) a
mapped S-NSSAI if provided in the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure of the released PDU session.

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\" and the UE provided an S-NSSAI during the PDU
session establishment, the UE shall stop timer T3585 if it is running
for the S-NSSAI provided by the UE. The UE should then re-initiate the
UE requested PDU session establishment procedure for the same S-NSSAI.
If the UE did not provide an S-NSSAI during the PDU session
establishment and the request type was different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", the UE shall stop the timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI
if it is running, and should re-initiate the UE requested PDU session
establishment procedure without including an S-NSSAI. If the PDU SESSION
RELEASE COMMAND message was received for an emergency PDU session, the
UE shall not stop the timer T3585 associated with no S-NSSAI if it is
running.

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\" and the UE provided a DNN during the PDU
session establishment, the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running
for the DNN provided by the UE. The UE should then re-initiate the UE
requested PDU session establishment procedure for the same DNN. If the
UE did not provide a DNN during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop the
timer T3396 associated with no DNN if it is running, and should
re-initiate the UE requested PDU session establishment procedure without
including a DNN. If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message was received
for an emergency PDU session, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396
associated with no DNN if it is running.

If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM cause \#39
\"reactivation requested\" and the UE provided an S-NSSAI and a DNN
during the PDU session establishment, the UE shall stop timer T3584 if
it is running for the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination provided by the
UE. The UE should then re-initiate the UE requested PDU session
establishment procedure for the same \[S-NSSAI, DNN\] combination. If
the UE did not provide an S-NSSAI during the PDU session establishment,
the UE shall stop the timer T3584 associated with \[no S-NSSAI, DNN\] if
it is running, and should re-initiate the UE requested PDU session
establishment procedure with the same DNN but without an S-NSSAI. If the
UE did not provide a DNN during the PDU session establishment and the
request type was different from \"initial emergency request\" and
different from \"existing emergency PDU session\", the UE shall stop the
timer T3584 associated with \[S-NSSAI, no DNN\] if it is running, and
should re-initiate the UE requested PDU session establishment procedure
with the same S-NSSAI but without a DNN. If the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message was received for an emergency PDU session, the UE shall
not stop the timer T3584 associated with \[S-NSSAI, no DNN\] if it is
running. If the UE provided neither a DNN nor an S-NSSAI during the PDU
session establishment and the request type was different from \"initial
emergency request\" and different from \"existing emergency PDU
session\", the UE shall stop the timer T3584 associated with \[no
S-NSSAI, no DNN\] if it is running, and should re-initiate the UE
requested PDU session establishment procedure without an S-NSSAI and a
DNN. If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message was received for an
emergency PDU session, the UE shall not stop the timer T3584 associated
with \[no S-NSSAI, no DNN\] if it is running.

NOTE 2: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
automatically.

NOTE 3: If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM
cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for a PDU session, the UE provided
a DNN (or no DNN) and an S-NSSAI (or no S-NSSAI) when the PDU session is
established, timer T3396 associated with the DNN (or no DNN, if no DNN
was provided by the UE) is running, and timer T3584 associated with the
DNN (or no DNN, if no DNN was provided by the UE) and the S-NSSAI (or no
S-NSSAI, if no S-NSSAI was provided by the UE) is running, then the UE
stops both the timer T3396 and the timer T3584.

NOTE 4: If the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message includes 5GSM
cause \#39 \"reactivation requested\" for a PDU session, the UE provided
a DNN (or no DNN) and an S-NSSAI (or no S-NSSAI) when the PDU session is
established, timer T3585 associated with the S-NSSAI (or no S-NSSAI, if
no S-NSSAI was provided by the UE) is running, and timer T3584
associated with the DNN (or no DNN, if no DNN was provided by the UE)
and the S-NSSAI (or no S-NSSAI, if no S-NSSAI was provided by the UE) is
running, then the UE stops both the timer T3585 and the timer T3584.
