Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document contains the description and definition of the
measurements performed by network or the UE that are transferred over
the standardised interfaces in order to support NR radio link
operations, radio resource management (RRM), network operations and
maintenance (OAM), minimization of drive tests (MDT) and self-organising
networks (SON).

Only the differences relative to TS 28.552 v16.2.0 \[2\] are specified
in this specification.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in TR 21.905
\[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR
21.905 \[1\].

3.2 Abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR
21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the

4 Layer 2 measurements
======================

4.1 General
-----------

All the per DRB per cell measurements and per DRB per UE measurements
can be aggregated into per QoS level per cell and per PLMN ID per cell
by network implementation. All the performance measurements for gNB
defined in TS 28.552 \[2\] 5.1 can be calculated into per PLMN ID level
by network implementation. Per QoS level refers to per mapped 5QI for NR
SA or per QCI for EN-DC.

4.2 NR measurements performed by the gNB
----------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Measurements valid for all gNB deployment scenarios

#### 4.2.1.1 Received Random Access Preambles

##### 4.2.1.1.1 Received Random Access Preambles per cell

A use case for this measurement is RACH configuration optimization,
where Received Random Access Preambles is signalled across an OAM
interface.

#### 4.2.1.2 Packet delay

##### 4.2.1.2.1 General

Packet delay includes RAN part of delay and CN part of delay.

The RAN part of DL packet delay measurement comprises:

\- D1 (DL delay in over-the-air interface), referring to Average delay
DL air-interface in TS 28.552 \[2\] 5.1.1.1.1.

\- D2 (DL delay on gNB-DU), referring to Average delay in RLC sublayer
of gNB-DU in TS 28.552 \[2\] 5.1.3.3.3.

\- D3 (DL delay on F1-U), referring to Average delay on F1-U in TS
28.552 \[2\] 5.1.3.3.2.

\- D4 (DL delay in CU-UP), referring to Average delay DL in CU-UP in TS
28.552 \[2\] 5.1.3.3.1.

The DL packet delay measurements, i.e. D1 (the DL delay in over-the-air
interface ), D2 (the DL delay in gNB-DU), D3 (the DL delay on F1-U) and
D4 (the DL delay in CU-UP), should be measured per DRB per UE.

NOTE: The delay measurements D1, D2 and D4 are also applicable for EUTRA
in case of EN-DC related DL delay measurements on the MN side.

The RAN part (including UE) of UL packet delay measurement comprises:

\- D1 (UL PDCP packet average delay, as defined in clause 4.3.1.1).

\- D2.1 (average over-the-air interface packet delay, as defined in
4.2.1.2.2).

\- D2.2 (average RLC packet delay, as defined in 4.2.1.2.3).

\- D2.3 (average delay UL on F1-U, it is measured using the same metric
as the average delay DL on F1-U defined in TS 28.552 \[2\] clause
5.1.3.3.2).

\- D2.4 (average PDCP re-ordering delay, as defined in 4.2.1.2.4).

The UL packet delay measurements, i.e. D1(UL PDCP packet average delay),
D2.1(average over-the-air interface packet delay), D2.2(average RLC
packet delay), D2.3(average delay UL on F1-U) and D2.4(average PDCP
re-ordering delay), should be measured per DRB per UE. The unit of D1,
D2.1, D2.2, D2.3 and D2.4 is 0.1ms.

NOTE: The delay measurements D1, D2.1, D2.2 and D2.4 are also applicable
for EUTRA in case of EN-DC related UL delay measurements on the MN side.

For non CU-UP and DU split case, RAN part of packet delay excludes the
delay at FI-U interface, i.e. D2.3 and D3.

For split-DRB scenario, total UL/DL delay on the MCG or on the SCG is
calculated based on the above measurement definitions. For UL delay
calculation, the D1 measurement is the same for total UL delay on the
MCG and total UL delay on the SCG.

If network disables the PDCP re-ordering function, the value of Average
PDCP re-ordering delay i.e. D2.4 should be set to 0.

For the QoS monitoring in TS 23.501 \[4\], RAN informs the RAN part of
UL packet delay measurement, or the RAN part of DL packet delay
measurement, or both to the CN.

##### 4.2.1.2.2 Average over-the-air interface packet delay in the UL per DRB per UE

The objective of this measurement is to measure air interface UL packet
delay for OAM performance observability or for QoS verification of MDT
or for the QoS monitoring as defined in TS 23.501 \[4\].

#### 4.2.1.4 Number of stored inactive UE contexts

##### 4.2.1.4.1 General

The objective of the measurement is to measure number of stored inactive
UE contexts for OAM performance observability. It is intended to be part
of indication about the memory consumption in a RAN node.

The measurement is obtained by sampling at a pre-defined interval, the
number of inactive UE contexts for each gNB and then taking the
arithmetic mean or maximum value over pre-defined time duration.

### 4.3.1 Packet delay

#### 4.3.1.1 UL PDCP Packet Average Delay per DRB per UE

The objective of this measurement performed by UE is to measure Packet
Delay in Layer PDCP for QoS verification of MDT or for the QoS
monitoring as defined in TS 23.501 \[4\].

+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Definition | PDCP Packet Delay in the UL per DRB. This measurement  |
|            | refers to PDCP queuing delay for DRBs in the UE, which |
|            | captures the delay from packet arrival at PDCP upper   |
|            | SAP until the UL grant to transmit the packet is       |
|            | available, which has included the delay the UE gets    |
|            | resources granted (from sending SR/RACH to get the     |
|            | first grant). The measurement is done separately per   |
|            | DRB.                                                   |

NOTE: UE measures UL PDCP queueing delay at DRB level. It is up to gNB
to convert DRB level delay to QoS level delay with the assumption that
all QoS flows mapped to the same DRB get the same QoS treatment, and it
is up to gNB to calculate QoS level delay if multiple DRBs mapped with
the same QoS.

##### 4.3.1.2.1 Measurement report mapping for PDCP Excess Packet Delay

UL PDCP excess packet delay shall be measured according to configuration
as defined in TS 38.331 \[3\].

The UE shall report UL PDCP excess packet delay as the ratio of SDUs
exceeding the configured delay threshold and the total number of SDUs
received by the UE during the measurement period.

The reported PDCP excess packet delay ratio is mapped to 32 levels with
the quantities in the range of 0 \< nExcess ≤ 100% with uniform
quantization in the log domain.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 4.3.1.2.1-1.
