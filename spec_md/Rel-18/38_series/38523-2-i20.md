**Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS):** statement made by the
supplier of an implementation or system claimed to conform to a given
specification, stating which capabilities have been implemented

**ICS proforma:** document, in the form of a questionnaire, which when
completed for an implementation or system becomes an ICS

**Implementation extra Information for Testing (IXIT):** A statement
made by a supplier or implementer of an UEUT which contains or
references all of the information (in addition to that given in the ICS)
related to the UEUT and its testing environment, which will enable the
test laboratory to run an appropriate test suite against the UEUT

**IXIT proforma:** A document, in the form of a questionnaire, which
when completed for an UEUT becomes an IXIT

implementation or system claimed to conform to a given protocol
specification

**Protocol Implementation extra Information for Testing (PIXIT):** An
IXIT related to testing for conformance to a given protocol
specification

**Static conformance review**: A review of the extent to which the
static conformance requirements are claimed to be supported by the UEUT,

4 Recommended Test Case Applicability
=====================================

4.0 Introduction
----------------

The applicability of each individual test is identified in subclause
4.1. This is just a recommendation based on the purpose for which the
test case was written.

The applicability of every test is formally expressed by the use of
Boolean expressions that are based on parameters (ICS). The parameters
(ICS) included in TS 38.508-2 \[5\] are used in the test case
applicability condition without reference. Parameters (ICS) specified in
3GPP TS 36.523-2 \[10\] and 3GPP TS 34.229-2 \[9\] shall be referred
with proper reference. The parameters (ICS) shall be set according to
the capabilities of the UE on the operating band / band combination
under test.

Additional information related to the Test Case (TC), e.g. affecting its
dynamic behaviour or its execution may be provided as well.

The columns in subclause 4.1 have the following meaning:

##### Clause {#clause .H6}

The clause column indicates the clause number in TS 38.523-1 \[2\] that
contains the test body.

##### Title {#title .H6}

The title column describes the name of the test and contains the clause
title of the clause in TS 38.523-1 \[2\] that contains the test body.

##### Release {#release .H6}

The release column indicates the earliest release from which the test
case is applicable. In some specific cases it may indicate the
release(s) for which the TC is **only** applicable.

Note: Some exceptions to this interpretation may be indicated in Notes
in column \'Number of TC Executions\'.

##### Applicability - Condition {#applicability---condition .H6}

The following notations are used for the applicability column:

R recommended - the test case is recommended

O optional -- the test case is optional

N/A not applicable - in the given context, the test case is not
recommended.

Ci conditional - the test is recommended (\"R\") or not (\"N/A\")
depending on the support of other items. \"i\" is an integer identifying
a unique conditional status expression which is defined immediately
following the table. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax \"IF
\... THEN (IF \... THEN \... ELSE\...) ELSE \...\" is used to avoid
ambiguities.

NOTE: The conditions are defined in subclause 4.2.

##### Applicability - Comments {#applicability---comments .H6}

This column contains a verbal description of the condition.

##### Additional Information - Specific ICS {#additional-information---specific-ics .H6}

This column contains the mnemonics of ICS(s) affecting the dynamic
behaviour of the TC.

##### Additional Information - Specific IXIT {#additional-information---specific-ixit .H6}

This column contains the mnemonics of IXIT(s) affecting the dynamic
behaviour of the TC.

##### Additional Information - Number of TC Executions {#additional-information---number-of-tc-executions .H6}

This column contains, wherever applicable, the recommended for
certification purposes number of TC executions. It may contain also
other information e.g. exceptions to the release applicable to the test.
Clarifying notes are listed at the end of the same Table.

##### Additional Information - Release other RAT {#additional-information---release-other-rat .H6}

In regard to a particular test case, this column provides information on
the release which is used by the simulated network in the other (i.e.
non 5GS) RAT(s) where applicable. For each applicable RAT the release
shall be indicated in the format \'Rel-X RAT\'. When multiple RATs are
applicable the entries per RAT shall be separated by a comma. When a
value for a 3GPP RAT is not provided but the RAT is in the scope of the
test case then for this RAT the release indicated in the Release column
applies (per default).

Note: Void.

######## Annex A (informative): Rel-16 and later test cases completed for RedCap UEs

Currently for RedCap UEs that set the PICS complying with TS 38.508-2
\[5\] clause A.4.3.12, Rel-15 test cases and Rel-17 RedCap specific test
cases are applicable.

In the current version of the specification, Rel-16 and later test cases
listed in Table A-1 have been fully analysed and confirmed to be
completed for execution against RedCap UEs. Applicability of other
Rel-16 and later test cases are under further study.
