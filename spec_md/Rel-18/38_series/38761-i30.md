Foreword
========

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

#### 6.2.2.2 Doppler/Temporal correlation 

The Doppler should be validated in a Beam-Specific manner. It is assumed
that the beams are mapped to the inputs of the channel emulator as
follows:

\- Beam 1: Input 1 and Input 2

\- Beam 2: Input 3 and Input 4 (CDL-C UMa only)

The Doppler measurement results of UMa CDL-C for bands n41, n78, and n1
are presented in Figures 6.2.2.2-1\~6.

#### 6.2.2.3 Spatial correlation

The Spatial correlation should be validated in a Beam-Combined manner.
It is assumed that the beams are mapped to the inputs of the channel
emulator as follows:

\- Beam 1: Input 1 and Input 2

\- Beam 2: Input 3 and Input 4 (CDL-C UMa only)

\- Combined beam for CDL-C UMa: Input 1 + Input 2 + Input 3 + Input 4

\- Combined beam for CDL-C UMi: Input 1 + Input 2

The Spatial correlation measurement results of UMa CDL-C for bands n41,
n78, and n1 are presented in Figures 6.2.2.3-1\~6.

7 Lab alignment of FR1 MIMO OTA
===============================

7.1 General
-----------

**To establish valid and trustable measurement data pools for defining
FR1 MIMO OTA requirements, lab alignment campaigns are required before
measurement campaign for ensuring there is no unexpected deviations
among labs. 3GPP RAN4 performed a lab alignment campaign for bands \>
1GHz during Rel-17, and a lab alignment campaign for bands \< 1GHz
during Rel-18.**

7.2 Noise impact in MPAC on MIMO performance
--------------------------------------------

This clause includes analysis and experimental measurement results of
the impact of noise in MPAC on FR1 MIMO OTA performance.

During Rel-18, several companies studied the impact of noise in MPAC on
FR1 MIMO OTA performance, conducted experiments, and obtained similar
observations. It was found that by adding suitable attenuators after the
amplifiers in MPAC system, the impact of noise can be eliminated and the
MIMO OTA measurement results can be corrected, as shown in Figure 7.2-1.

Figure 7.2-1: Measurement setup for *correcting FR1 MIMO OTA test
results with MPAC*

The measurement results (12 orientations average in FS DMP mode) at
bands n28 (780.5MHz) and n41 (2593MHz) obtained by Lab 1 are show in
Figure 7.2-2. The same DUT were measured with different attenuation
values. It can be observed that, as the attenuation value increases, the
measurement results first get better and then become stable. At the
lower frequency, the effect of the attenuation value is more obvious,
and it requires a lager attenuation to make the measurement results
stable. The reason is that at lower frequency, the path loss from the
amplifier output to the chamber centre is smaller, and when the
amplifier noise arrives at the chamber centre, it has higher power than
that at higher frequency.

**Adding attenuators after the amplifiers can reduce the noise and make
it** neglectable for FR1 MIMO OTA testing. A suitable attenuation value
can be selected, e.g., for **band n28, the measurement results with
20dB-**attenuation and **30dB-**attenuation are almost the same, but the
**measurement result with 10dB-**attenuation is worse, which means
**20dB-**attenuation is enough for **band n28 in Lab 1's MPAC system.**

  @ 50% throughput       0.59 dB
  @ 70% throughput       0.66 dB
  @ 90% throughput       0.67 dB

Based on the observations, RAN4 reached the following agreements:

\- Labs should first exclude the impact of noise before performing MIMO
OTA measurements, especially for frequency bands \<1GHz.

\- Perform a low-band lab alignment activity at Band n28, to
cross-validate the measurement results from different labs and ensure
the validity of the data pool for requirements definition.

7.3 Lab alignment campaign for frequency bands \> 1GHz
------------------------------------------------------

### 7.3.1 Framework

*This clause defines the working procedure on how to proceed the lab
alignment campaign for frequency bands \> 1GHz.*

Labs/companies volunteer to participate in the performance requirement
part shall complete the lab alignment measurements and system validation
measurements, results should be submitted to RAN4 for review.

Using the testing conditions as defined in TS38.151.

The test bands for lab alignment are n41 and n78. Three performance
alignment devices (PADs) for each band should be tested to ensure the
alignment of measurement results.

TRMS value in SA mode will be used for alignment comparison.

The reference value of each PAD should be the average of the PAD
measurement results submitted on or before 12:00 UTC 30th April 2022,
based on the condition at least 3 labs' results collected. Submission
with measurement data after 12:00 UTC 30th April can be considered for
lab alignment, but will not change the reference TRMS value.

The acceptance criteria for declaring alignment should be defined based
on the preliminary MU value of MPAC system. The detailed criteria for
accepting the outcome of the lab alignment activity are listed in Table
7.3.3-1.

Note:

\- The PAD measurement results shall NOT be shared to anyone before
submitting to RAN4 meetings or sharing in the NR MIMO OTA reflector.
Comparison and alignment analyses should only be done in RAN4 meetings.

*- Three PADs for each band are selected. Labs should submit PAD
measurements results in an anonymous approach, i.e., the PADs for each
band should be marked as PAD\_1, PAD\_2, and PAD\_3, respectively. The
mapping between the codename PAD\_n and the actual PAD shall only be
known among the labs participated in the alignment activity, and shall
NOT be disclosed to any other companies.*

### 7.3.2 Measurement results

RAN4 carried out the lab alignment campaign for frequency bands \> 1GHz
during Rel-17. Considering the test burden and urgent timeline, RAN4
decided to select three smartphones (named as PADs, Performance
Alignment Devices) as reference DUTs, and select two bands, n41 and n78,
to perform FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment activity for frequencies bands \>
1GHz.

There are 6 test labs participated in the lab alignment campaign, the
reference value of each PAD at each band is derived based on linear
average (with dBm) of PAD measurement results submitted by all labs. The
summary of the lab alignment results is shown in Table 7.3.2-1 and
Figure 7.3.2-1. The TRMS offset between each measurement result and
reference value of FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment is shown in Table 7.3.2-2
and Figure 7.3.2-1.

bands \> 1GHz, all the 6 test labs are aligned. FR1 MIMO OTA performance
requirements for bands \> 1GHz are specified based on the measurement
results submitted by the above aligned test labs.

\- Use the same worksheet template in **R4-2316308** to submit the
measurement results. Report any systematic offsets that have been
applied to the TRMS results. The lab alignment outcome should be based
on the measurement results without power validation systematic offsets.

\- The measurement results should be submitted to RAN4 by anonymous
approach (the UE model shall not be disclosed publicly)

\- Results shall not be shared between labs before submitting to RAN4
meetings or sharing in the RAN4 reflector. Comparison and lab alignment
analysis should only be done in RAN4 meetings/discussions

5\. Lab alignment criteria:

\- The pass/fail criteria are defined as the maximum deviation between
the measurement result and the reference value

\- The reference value will be derived based on the averaging approach
(linear average in dBm) of lab alignment data pool from ≥ 3 labs

\- Apparent outliers (if identified) will not be considered in the
average process for reference value. The PAD measurement result deviates
over 1.5\* MU (i.e., 3.92 dB for band n28) from all the other labs'
results should be identified as apparent outlier.

\- Pass/fail limit for lab alignment should be defined as 0.75\*MU (+/-
1.96 dB for band n28).

6\. Volunteer lab procedures:

\- PAD delivery scheme: Decide PAD delivery scheme after all the
volunteer labs and PADs information being confirmed.

\- PAD measurement time in each volunteer lab: finalize PAD measurement
within \[7\] workdays, and deliver to the next lab ASAP with PAD
delivery In/Out information shared in email-reflector.

### 7.4.2 Measurement results

RAN4 carried out the lab alignment campaign for frequency bands \< 1GHz
during Rel-18. RAN4 decided to select three smartphones (named as PADs,
Performance Alignment Devices) as reference DUTs, and select band n28,
to perform FR1 MIMO OTA lab alignment activity for frequencies bands \<
1GHz.

There are 6 test labs participated in the lab alignment campaign, the
reference value of each PAD at each band is derived based on linear
average (with dBm) of PAD measurement results submitted by all labs.
Channel model validation results and noise impact evaluations performed
by the 6 labs are presented in Clauses 6.2.2 and 7.2. The summary of the
lab alignment results is shown in Table 7.4.2-1 and Figure 7.4.2-1. The
deviation between each TRMS measurement result and reference value is
shown in Table 7.4.2-2 and Figure 7.4.2-1.

8 Lab alignment of FR2 MIMO OTA
===============================

8.1 Framework
-------------

*This clause defines the working procedure on how to proceed the FR2
MIMO OTA lab alignment campaign.* The purpose of lab alignment activity
is to ensure there is no unexpected lab deviation and establish full
trust and confidence on the measurement data pool for specifying FR2
MIMO OTA performance requirements.

1\. Test labs are invited to participate in the lab alignment activity,
the following conditions should be fulfilled:

\- At least 3 participating labs are required.

\- Participating labs shall complete channel model validation.

\- Participating labs should have sufficient test resource to provide
on-time measurement results without delay.

\- Each lab should finalize PAD measurement within 10 workdays, and
deliver to the next lab in the same country ASAP with PAD In/Out
information shared via email-reflector; otherwise, labs in the same
country should equally share the period for testing the PADs.

2\. Test methodology:

\- Test plan: 3GPP TS 38.151

3\. Test cases for Lab Alignment Activity:

\- Test band: n261 (for PADs that support n261), n257 (for the PAD that
does not support n261)

\- Number of test cases: 2\~4 PADs per-band

\- Operation mode: NR Non-Standalone (NSA) is preferred and SA is not
precluded, and should be mapped with the measurement results submission.

\- Power class: PC3

4\. Test results submission:

\- Use the same worksheet template in R4-2308740 to submit the
measurement results

\- The measurement results should be submitted to RAN4 by anonymous
approach (the UE model shall not be disclosed publicly)

\- Results shall not be shared between labs before submitting to RAN4
meetings or sharing in the RAN4 reflector. Comparison and lab alignment
analysis should only be done in RAN4 meetings/discussions

5\. Lab alignment criteria:

\- The pass/fail criteria are defined as the maximum deviation between
the MASC measurement result and the reference value

\- The reference value is derived based on the per-band linear averaging
approach (in dB) of lab alignment data pool from ≥ 3 labs, apparent
outliers (if identified) should not be considered in the average process
for deriving reference values. The PAD measurement result deviates over
\[1.5\]\*preliminary MU (i.e., 7.575 dB for band n261/n257) from all the
other labs' results should be identified as apparent outlier.

\- Pass/fail limit for lab alignment is defined as ±0.75\*preliminary
MU, i.e., ±3.79 dB for band n261/n257.

8.3 Pass/fail limits 
--------------------

Based on the preliminary MU assessment of FR2 3D-MPAC system in Annex
B.2.5 of TS 38.151 V18.0.0, and lab alignment measurement results in
Clause 8.2, RAN4 decided the final pass/fail limits for FR2 MIMO OTA lab
alignment activity as 0.75\*preliminary MU, i.e., +/-3.79 dB for band
n261/n257.

8.4 Conclusion
--------------

RAN4 concluded the successful FR2 MIMO OTA lab alignment activity for
band n261/n257, with 4 test labs aligned. Rel-18 FR2 MIMO OTA
performance requirements are specified based on the measurement results
submitted by the above aligned test labs.
