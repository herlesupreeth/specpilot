In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for RF *Repeater* *type 2-O and network
controlled repeater (NCR) type 1-H and 2-O*. These have been derived
from, and are consistent with the radiated requirements for *Repeater
type 2-O and network controlled repeater (NCR) type 1-H and 2-O* in
Repeater specification defined in TS 38.106 \[2\].

RF *Repeater type 1-C and NCR type 1-C* only have conducted requirements
so they does not require compliance to this specification.

*NCR type 1- H* has both conducted and radiated requirements so it
requires compliance to this specification and TS 38.115-1 \[23\].

*RF Repeater type 2-O and NCR type 2-O* have only radiated requirements
so they require compliance to this specification only.

4 General radiated test conditions and declarations
===================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 2
of this specification, i.e., to all radiated tests defined for FR2. The
FR2 frequency range is defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.106 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.106 \[2\]. Test Tolerances
for the radiated test requirements explicitly stated in the present
document are given in annex C of the present document.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

Reuse of Test Tolerance values from TS 38.521-2 \[20\] for the purpose
of MT-specific test requirements is subject to the following conditions:

\- NCR test methodology follows test procedures in TS 38.521-2 \[20\],

\- Maximum device size limit as captured in TS 38.521-2 \[20\].

Otherwise, reuse of Test Tolerance values from TS 38.521-2 \[20\] for
the purpose of MT-specific test requirements may not be justified for
some NCR products.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

#### 4.1.2.2 Radiated characteristics measurements

The maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for radiated characteristics
measurements are given in tables 4.1.2.2-1. Details for derivation of
OTA Test System uncertainty are given in corresponding clauses in
TR 37.941 \[13\].

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545
\[3\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g., receiver tests,
this may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will
ensure that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not
increase the chance of passing a device under test where that device
would otherwise have failed the test if a Test System compliant with
clause 4.1.2 had been used.

4.2 Radiated requirement reference points
-----------------------------------------

### 4.2.0 NCR type 1-H

For *NCR type 1-H*, the requirements are defined for two points of

requirements.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

#### 4.7.2.2 RTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation for RF repeater type 2-O

The purpose of test configuration RTC1 is to test all repeater
requirements that need an input signal in the *passband* when there is
only one *passband* per *operating band*.

##### 4.7.2.2.1 RTC1 generation

RTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth supported shall be used
(D.27);

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower *passband* edge. If the width of the *passband* is
at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to be tested then place a
second signal adjacent to the upper *passband* edge. Otherwise
reposition the carrier to be tested according to the single carrier test
frequencies described in section 4.9.1.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis. All configured component carriers are transmitted simultaneously
in the tests where the repeater should be ON.

##### 4.7.2.2.2 RTC1 power allocation

Set the TRP of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the
test (i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

#### 4.7.2.4 RTC2: Non-contiguous spectrum operation for RF repeater type 2-O

The purpose of RTC2 is to test all repeater requirements that need an
input signal in the *passband* when there is more than one *passband*
per *operating band*.

##### 4.7.2.4.1 RTC2 generation

RTC2 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The repeater *passband* bandwidths shall be the declared maximum
repeater RF Bandwidth supported for multiple passbands (D.27). The
repeater RF Bandwidth consists of one sub-block gap and the two highest
and lowest declared *passbands*.

\- For each *passband*, select the carrier to be tested according to
4.7.2. If the width of the *passband* is at least twice that of the
carrier to be tested then place a carrier adjacent to the upper
*passband* edge and another carrier (as described in 4.7.2) adjacent to
the lower *passband* edge. Otherwise, tests shall be applied with one
carrier adjacent to the lower sub-block edge and one carrier adjacent to
the upper sub-block edge for each sub-block gap.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

##### 4.7.2.4.2 RTC2 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the
test (i.e., either P~in,p,EIRP~ or P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

4.7.2.5 NCRTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation for NCR type 2-O

The purpose of test configuration NCRTC1 is to test all NCR requirements
that need an input signal in the *passband* when there is only one
*passband* per *operating band*.

4.7.2.5.1 NCRTC1 generation

NCRTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

> \- Declared maximum NCR RF Bandwidth supported shall be used (D.27);

\- Place an NCR-MT carrier at the lower end of the passband. Generate an
NR carrier using test equipment at the upper edge of the passband, and a
second NR carrier adjacent to the NCR-MT carrier within the passband. If
there is insufficient space for the NR carriers then remove firstly the
NR carrier adjacent to the NCR-MT carrier and then if needed the NR
carrier at the upper end of the passband.

\- Place an NCR-MT carrier at the upper end of the passband. Generate an
NR carrier using test equipment at the lower edge of the passband, and a
second NR carrier adjacent to the NCR-MT carrier within the passband. If
there is insufficient space for the NR carriers then remove firstly the
NR carrier adjacent to the NCR-MT carrier and then if needed the NR
carrier at the lower end of the passband.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis. All configured component carriers are transmitted simultaneously
in the tests where the NCR should be ON.

4.7.2.5.2 NCRTC1 power allocation

Set the TRP of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the expected input power to the NCR for the test
(i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single passband testing many tests in the present document are
performed with appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top
channels of the supported frequency range of the repeater. These are
denoted as RF channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
passband at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in the present document are performed with the maximum
*repeater RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom, middle and top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as
B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum *repeater RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum *repeater RF Bandwidth* located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum *repeater RF Bandwidth* located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single passband, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may
consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

### 4.9.2 Test models

applicable test model is made within each test.

The following general parameters are used by all NR test models:

\- Duration is 2 radio frames for TDD (20 ms)

\- The slots are numbered 0 to 10×2^µ^ -- 1 where µ is the numerology
corresponding to the subcarrier spacing

\- N~RB~ is the maximum transmission bandwidth configuration seen in
table 5.3.2-2 in TS 38.106 \[2\].

\- Normal CP

\- Virtual resource blocks of localized type

4.9A RF channels and test models of NCR
---------------------------------------

### 4.9A.1 RF channels

For the single passband or carrier testing many tests in this
specification are performed with appropriate frequencies in the bottom,
middle and top channels of the supported frequency range of the NCR.
These are denoted as RF channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
passband or carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in the present document are performed with the maximum NCR RF
Bandwidth located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~
(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum NCR RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum NCR RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum NCR RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single passband or carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for
single band operation, the position of B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and
B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band combinations shall be
specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult with operators,
the manufacturer or other bodies.

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a repeater or NCR operates can either be
contiguous or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements
in the present specification apply for repeater or NCR configured for
both contiguous spectrum operation and non-contiguous spectrum
operation.

For repeater or NCR operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some
requirements apply both at the repeater or NCR *passband* edges and
inside the sub-block gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how
the limits apply relative to the repeater or NCR *passband* edges and
the sub-block edges respectively.

4.11 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

X Title

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

X.1 Definition and applicability

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

X.2 Minimum requirement

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.

X.3 Test purpose

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

X.4 Method of test

X.4.1 General

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

X.4.2y First test method

X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up. The OTA Test System is assumed to be correctly calibrated as
part of the initial conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.

X.4.2y.2 Procedure

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like domain (e.g.
frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms
(e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g.
average result from several measurement positions).

X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

X.5 Test requirement

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 (Interpretation of measurement results). Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

4.12 Reference coordinate system
--------------------------------

Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic
characteristics (e.g. EIRP) at certain angles with respect to the
repeater or NCR. To be able to declare radiated characteristics part of
radiated requirements a reference coordinate system is required. The
reference coordinate system should be associated to an identifiable
physical feature on the repeater or NCR enclosure. The location of the
origin and the orientation of the reference coordinate system are for
the repeater or NCR manufacturer to declare.

The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate
system with rectangular axis (x***,*** y***,*** z) and spherical angles
(θ, φ) as showed in figure 4.12-1.

![](./media/image14.emf){width="3.933333333333333in"
height="4.066666666666666in"}

Figure 4.12-1: Reference coordinate system

φ*** ***is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the
projection of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined
between -180° and +180°, inclusive. θ*** *** is the angle between the
projection of the vector in the x***/***y plane and the radiating vector
and is defined between -90° and +90°, inclusive. Note that θ is defined
as positive along the down-tilt angle.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the NR repeater operation in NR operating bands specification, their
channel bandwidth configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as
synchronization raster specification, refer to TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 5
and its relevant clauses.

For the radiated testing purposes in this specification, only FR2-1
operating bands are considered.

6 Radiated characteristics
==========================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the radiated characteristics are specified at
RIB for *repeater type 2-O* configuration in normal operating
conditions.

Requirements apply in both DL and UL unless otherwise stated, or
declared.

\- For the DL the BS-side RIB is the input and the UE-side RIB is the
output.

\- For the UL the UE-side RIB is the input and the BS-side RIB is the
output.

General test conditions for radiated tests of the *repeater type 2-O*
are given in clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results
and configurations for testing. Repeater configurations for the tests
are defined in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band RIB* have been declared equivalent (D.32),
only a representative one is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.

6.2 OTA output power
--------------------

### 6.2.1 General

OTA output power includes both OTA output EIRP power and OTA output TRP.

### 6.2.2 OTA output power (EIRP)

#### 6.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam
at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each declared beam, the requirement is based on declarations
captured in clause 4.6 for a beam identifier (D.3), *reference beam
direction pair* (D.6), *rated beam EIRP* (D.9) at the beam\'s reference
direction pair, *OTA peak directions set* (D.7), the *beam direction
pairs* at the maximum steering directions (D.8) and their associated
*rated beam EIRP* and *beamwidth(s)* for reference *beam direction pair*
and maximum steering directions (D.10).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the repeater is declared to radiate at
the associated *beam peak direction*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in clause 6.2.4.

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *passbands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW) is
larger than 6%, two rated beam EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated beam EIRP
is:

\- P~rated,out,FBWlow,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh,~ for the output whose frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

The repeater radiated transmit power requirements are specified at
*single-band RIB*.

If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.11, D.12), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.

The *repeater rated beam EIRP output power* for *repeater type 2-O* UL
transmission shall be within limits as specified in table 6.2.2.1-1.

#### 6.2.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band RIB* supporting
transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O* is defined for normal
and extreme conditions in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR type 1-H* and *NCR type 2-O* is defined
for normal and extreme conditions in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.2.3.

#### 6.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability to accurately generate and
direct radiated power per beam, across the frequency range, for all
declared beams.

#### 6.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- Normal, see annex A.2,

\- Extreme, see annexes A.3 and A.5.

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex E.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

RF channels positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1.

Under extreme test environment, it is sufficient to test on one NR-ARFCN
or one RF bandwidth position, and with one applicable test configuration
defined in clauses 4.7 and 4.8. Testing shall be performed under extreme
power supply conditions, as defined in annex B.5.

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA peak directions set reference beam direction pair (D.6), and

\- OTA peak directions set maximum steering directions (D.8).

Beams to be tested: Declared beam with the highest intended EIRP for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWθ, or for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWϕ (D.3, D.9).

Power levels to be tested:

\- The lowest input power (P~p,in,EIRP~) that produces the *rated
passband TRP output power* (P~rated,p,TRP~).

\- The lowest input power (P~p,in,EIRP~) that produces the *rated
passband TRP output power* (P~rated,p,TRP~), plus 10 dB.

##### 6.2.2.4.2 Procedure

For normal test environment conditions in OTA domain, the test procedure
is as follows:

1\) Place the DUT at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the DUT with the test system.

3\) For repeater type 2-O, orient the positioner (and repeater and test
signal generator) in order that the direction to be tested aligns with
the test antenna and the correct angle of arrival for the input signal
is achieved.

> For NCR-Fwd, orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal
> generator) in order that the direction to be tested aligns with the
> test antenna and the correct angle of arrival for the input signal is
> achieved; for NCR-MT, configure the NCR-MT such that the beam peak
> direction(s) applied during the power measurement step 7.

4\) Configure the *beam peak direction* of the DUT according to the
declared *beam direction pair if necessary*.

5\) Set the test signal generator power at the RIB as shown in annex E
with a power equivalent to the power level to be tested, according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test model(s) in clause 4.9.2, in the correct direction in respect to
the repeater.

6\) Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and
p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

7\) Test steps 3 to 6 are repeated for all declared beams (D.7) and
their reference *beam direction pairs* and *maximum steering directions*
(D.6 and D.8), and for all applicable power levels.

For extreme conditions tests the methods in TS 38.141-2 \[6\], annex B.7
may be used.

the test antenna and the correct angle of arrival for the input signal
is achieved.

> generator) in order that the direction to be tested aligns with the
> test antenna and the correct angle of arrival for the input signal is
> achieved; for NCR-MT, configure the NCR-MT such that the beam peak
> direction(s) applied during the power measurement step 7 are
> consistent with the grid and measurement approach for the TRP test.

4\) Configure the DUT such that the beam peak direction(s) applied
during the power measurement step 6 are consistent with the grid and
measurement approach for the TRP test.

with a power equivalent to the tested input power level~,~ transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2, in the correct direction in
respect to the repeater.

6\) For repeater type 2-O, orient the positioner (and DUT) in order that
the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex G) whilst
maintaining the correct direction of arrival for the test signal.

6.5 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 6.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[4\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *passband* resulting from the modulation process
and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *repeater type 2-O and
NCR-Fwd type 2-O* transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent
Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating band unwanted emissions
(OBUE). OTA Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by an OTA spurious emissions requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined
in table 6.5.1-1 for *repeater type 2-O* for NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.5.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink/uplink
*operating band for repeater type 2-O*

+---------------------+------------------------------------+----------------+
| Repeater type       | *Operating band* characteristics   | Δf~OBUE~ (MHz) |
+=====================+====================================+================+
| *Repeater type 2-O* | F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz | 1500           |
|                     |                                    |                |
| *NCR-Fwd type 2-O*  | F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz |                |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+----------------+

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* as described per requirement.

If the NCR supports simultaneous NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd transmission, then
the unwanted emissions requirements should be defined on the total
emissions from NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd.

### 6.5.2 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
state*.

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.2.3.1.1.

For WA NCR-MT type 2-O, the BS ACLR requirements specified in clause
9.7.3.3 in TS 38.104 \[5\] apply.

For LA NCR-MT type 2-O, the UE ACLR requirements specified in clause
6.5.2.3 in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] apply.

For simultaneous transmission the limits apply for sum of NCR-MT
transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission

#### 6.5.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement
shall be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.2.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex G.

1\) Place the repeater at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.5.2.5.

\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

4a) For RF repeater, set the input signal at the RIB according to the
applicable test configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models RDL-FR2-TM1.1 and RUL-FR2-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum rated
output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.

For NCR-Fwd, set the input signal at the RIB according to the applicable
test configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test models NCRDL-FR2-TM1.1 and NCRUL-FR2-TM1.1 in clause 4.9A.2 at the
input power intended to produce the maximum rated output power,
P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.

For NCR-MT, set the NCR-MT with the declared maximum output power
according to the applicable test configuration and direction in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models NCRUL-FR2-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2.

4b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex G) whilst
maintaining the correct direction of arrival for the test signal.

6\) Measure the absolute power of the assigned channel frequency and the
(adjacent channel frequency).

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex G).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the
wanted channel and the adjacent channel using the measurements made in
Step 7.

9\) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.

NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the
assigned channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent
frequency channel.

10\) Measure OTA ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of the
passband edge and carrier edge as specified in table 6.5.2.5-1. In
multiple carrier case only offset frequencies below the lowest and above
the highest carrier frequency used shall be measured.

b\) Measure OTA CACLR inside *gap between passbands*, if applicable.

#### 6.5.2.5 Test requirements

The OTA ACLR limit for *repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* is
specified in table 6.5.2.5-1 for DL and UL for Wide Area class and DL
for Local Area class.

The OTA ACLR limit for *repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* is
specified in table 6.5.2.5-1a for UL for Local Area class.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit for *repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type
2-O* is specified in table 6.5.2.5-2.

The OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit for *repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd
type 2-O* in table 6.5.2.5-2 or 6.5.2.5-5 or the ACLR (CACLR) limit in
table 6.5.2.5-1, 6.5.2.5-3 or 6.5.2.5-4, whichever is less stringent,
shall apply.

For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA ACLR
requirement for *repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* in table
6.5.2.5-3 shall apply in *gaps between passbands* for the frequency
ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR requirement for
*repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* in table 6.5.2.5-4 shall
apply in *gaps between passbands* for the frequency ranges defined in
the table.

The CACLR in a *gap between passbands* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
between passbands*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective passband edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.5.2.5-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.5.2.5-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *gap between passbands* shall be higher
than the value specified in table 6.5.2.5-4.

### 6.5.3 OTA operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

The requirements of either clause 6.5.3.4.1 (Category A limits) or
clause 6.5.3.4.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*repeater type 2-O* and
*NCR-Fwd type 2-O*) in clause 6.5.4. In addition, the limits in clause
6.5.3.4.3 may also apply.

Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits.

For *repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type 2-O*, unless otherwise stated,
the OTA operating band unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each
supported downlink *operating band*.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in contiguous spectrum, the
requirements apply to the frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the edge
of the *passband.* In addition, for a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *gap between passbands*.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *passband*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband* edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In addition, inside any *gap between passbands* for a *RIB* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the *limits* specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of
the *gap between passbands*. The *limit* for each *sub-block* is
specified in clauses 6.5.3.4.1 and 6.5.3.4.2 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passbands* bandwidth
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.3.3.1.1.

For Wide Area *NCR-MT type 2-O*, the BS OBUE requirements specified in
clause 9.7.4.3 in TS 38.104 \[5\] apply.

For Local Area *NCR-MT type 2-O*, the UE SEM requirements specified in
clause 6.5.2.1 in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] apply.

#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I.

1\) Place the RF repeater or NCR at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- detection mode: true RMS.

\- As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g.
carrier leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the
measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the
measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

4a) For RF repeater, set the input signal at the RIB according to the
applicable test configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models RDL-FR2-TM1.1and RUL-FR2-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2
at the input power intended to produce the maximum rated output power,
P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.

\- For NCR-Fwd, set the input signal at the RIB according to the
applicable test configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models NCRDL-FR2-TM1.1 and NCRUL-FR2-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9A.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum rated
output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.

\- For NCR-MT, set the NCR-MT with the declared maximum output power
according to the applicable test configuration and direction in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models NCRUL-FR2-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2.

4b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex G) whilst
maintaining the correct direction of arrival for the test signal.

6\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For connector under test
declared to operate in non-contiguous spectrum, the emission within the
*sub-block gap* shall be measured using the specified measurement
bandwidth from the closest sub block edge.

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex G).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in Step 7.

#### 6.5.3.5 Test requirements

##### 6.5.3.5.1 OTA operating band unwanted emission limits (Category A)

*Repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* unwanted emissions shall not
exceed the maximum levels specified in table 6.5.3.5.1‑1 or 6.5.3.5.1-2
or 6.5.3.5.1-3.

### 6.5.4 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

For *repeater type 2-O* and *NCR-Fwd type 2-O*, the OTA transmitter
spurious emission limits apply from 30 MHz to 2^nd^ harmonic of the
upper frequency edge of the downlink *operating band*, excluding the
frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of the downlink
*operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the
downlink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
table 6.5.1-1.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.4.2..

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 2-O* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.5.3.1.1.

For Wide Area *NCR-MT type 2-O*, the OTA TX spurious emission
requirements are as defined in clause 7.5.4.2 in TS 38.106 \[2\].

For Local Area *NCR-MT type 2-O*, the OTA TX spurious emission
requirements defined for NR UE in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-2 \[14\]
apply.

#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex.

1\) Place the RF repeater or NCR at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- detection mode: true RMS.

4a) for RF repeater, set the input signal at the RIB according to the
applicable test configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models RDL-FR2-TM1.1 and RUL-FR2-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum rated
output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.

\- For NCR-Fwd, set the input signal at the RIB according to the
applicable test configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models NCRDL-FR2-TM1.1 and NCRUL-FR2-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9A.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum rated
output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.

\- For NCR-MT, set the NCR-MT with the declared maximum output power
according to the applicable test configuration and direction in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models NCRUL-FR2-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2.

4b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed with the specified
measurement bandwidth (see annex I) whilst maintaining the correct
direction of arrival for the test signal.

6\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex G).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in Step 7.

#### 6.5.4.5 Test requirements

##### 6.5.4.5.1 General

The requirements of either clause 6.5.4.5.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 6.5.4.5.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
Operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.5.3.

##### 6.5.4.5.2 OTA transmitter spurious emissions (Category A)

For RF repeater, NCR-Fwd and Wide-area NCR-MT, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the limits in table 6.5.4.5.2-1

##### 6.5.4.5.4 Additional OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the repeater-Node. The limits
may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in
the same geographical area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR
*operating band*. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.

6.6 OTA Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
---------------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of the repeater and the
measured signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the
equalization by the measurement equipment. This difference is called the
error vector. Details about how the RF repeater or NCR EVM is determined
are the same as specified in TS 38.104 \[5\] Annex \[C\] for FR2. The RF
repeater or NCR EVM result is defined as the square root of the ratio of
the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed in
percent. The accuracy of the input symbols is counted in the measurement
uncertainty.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range*
on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of the received
signal is in the reference direction at the receive side.

The RF repeater or NCR EVM requirement is applicable when the RF
repeater or NCR is operating with an input power level within the range
from what is required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power
(P~rated,p,EIRP~) to the minimum power levels in table 6.6.1.1-1.

### 6.6.2 Uplink Repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The RF Repeater or NCR Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the
difference between the reference waveform provided at the input of the
RF repeater or NCR and the measured waveform at the output of the RF
repeater or NCR. This difference is called the error vector. Details
about how the RF repeater or NCR EVM is determined are the same as
specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F. Before calculating the RF
repeater or NCR EVM, the measured waveform is corrected by the sample
timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be
removed from the measured waveform before calculating the RF repeater or
NCR EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the RF repeater or NCR EVM equaliser spectrum flatness
requirement specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] sub-clauses 6.4.2.4 and
6.4.2.5. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the RF repeater or NCR EVM result is
defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio
of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as
a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the RF repeater or NCR EVM result is defined
after the front-end FFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean
error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. The
accuracy of the input waveform is counted in the measurement
uncertainty.

The basic RF repeater or NCR EVM measurement interval is one slot in the
time domain. The RF repeater or NCR EVM measurement interval is reduced
by any symbols that contains an allowable power transient in the
measurement interval as defined in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] clause 6.3.3 for
EVM for UE.

All the parameters defined in clause 6.6.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in TS 38.101-2 \[14\] Annex F.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range*
on the transmit side and the AoA of the incident wave of the received
signal is in the reference direction at the receive side.

The RF repeater or NCR EVM requirement is applicable when the RF
repeater or NCR is operating with an input power level within the range
from what is required to reach the rated beam EIRP output power
(P~rated,p,EIRP~) to the minimum input power levels in table 6.6.2.1-1.

6.7 OTA input intermodulation
-----------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

#### 6.7.1.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the passband, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the passband.

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
RF repeater or NCR to maintain the wanted frequency free of internally
created interference.

The measurements shall apply to both uplink and downlink paths of the RF
repeater or NCR, during the *transmitter ON state* at maximum gain.

#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirements

of a received signal in the *passband* and a received signal on an
adjacent channel outside RF repeater or NCR *passband* is from the same
direction and are the same as the TX reference direction for the
opposite DL/UL setting*.*

For a RF repeater or NCR operating at passband operating in FR2, the
ACRR requirements in table 6.8.2.3.3-1 shall apply in downlink. In
normal conditions the ACRR for downlink shall be higher than the value
specified in the Table 6.8.2.3.3-1.

#### 6.9.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the OTA transmitter OFF power is
within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.9.1.4 Method of test

Requirement is tested together with transmitter transient period, as
described in clause 6.9.2.4.

#### 6.9.1.5 Test requirements

The conformance testing of transmit OFF power is included in the
conformance testing of transmitter transient period; therefore, see
clause 6.9.2.5 for test requirements.

### 6.9.2 OTA transient period

#### 6.9.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA *transmitter transient period* is the time period during which
the transmitter is changing from the tra*nsmitter OFF state* to the
*transmitter ON state* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient period*
is illustrated in figure 6.9.2.1-1.

Figure 6.9.2.1-1: Example of relations between transmitter *ON state*,
transmitter *OFF state* and *transmitter transient period*

This requirement shall be applied at each RIB supporting transmission in
the *operating band*.

For a RF repeater or NCR that is not declared to be a long delay
repeater (D.24), the beginning and end point of downlink and uplink
bursts are referenced to the slot timing at the input.

For a RF repeater or NCR that is declared to be a long delay repeater
(D.24), the beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are
referenced to the slot timing at the input plus the declared repeater
delay.

#### 6.9.2.2 Minimum requirement for RF repeater

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 7.9.3.2.

6.9.2.2A Minimum requirement for NCR

  ON to OFF        3

For Local Area *NCR-MT type 2-O,* the requirement from TS 38.101-2
\[14\] section 6.3.3.2 applies.

#### 6.9.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the OTA transmitter transient
periods are within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.9.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.9.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- The requirement is verified by an EIRP measurement at a direction
corresponding to the OTA peak directions set reference beam direction
pair (D.6) for the beam identifier (D.3) which provides the highest
intended EIRP.

##### 6.9.2.4.2 Procedure

1a) Place the repeater at the positioner.

1b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a
signal for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify
measured result is enough below requirement limit.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2)
of the repeater with the test system.

4a) For RF repeater transient period measurement, set the input signal
at the RIB according to the applicable test configuration and direction
in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models RDL-FR2‑TM 1.1 and
RUL-FR2‑TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce
the maximum rated output power, P~rated,in,\ EIRP~ + 10dB.

> For NCR-Fwd transient period measurement, set the input signal at the
> RIB according to the applicable test configuration and direction in
> clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models NCRDL-FR2 TM 1.1 and
> NCRUL-FR2 TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to
> produce the maximum rated output power, Prated,in, EIRP + 10dB.
>
> For NCR-MT transient period measurement, set according to the
> applicable test configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the
> corresponding test models NCRUL-FR2 TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the
> declared maximum output power.

4b)For OFF power measurement for RF repeater and NCR-Fwd, set the signal
generator RF output turned off for not to generate input signal.

> For OFF power measurement for NCR-Fwd, set the NCR-MT to turn off its
> transmitter.

5\) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order
that the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that
measurements to determine TRP can be performed (see annex I) whilst
maintaining the correct direction of arrival for the test signal.

6\) Measure the mean EIRP spectral density as the power sum over two
orthogonal polarizations over 70/N μs filtered with a square filter of
bandwidth equal to the *passband* bandwidth of the repeater centred on
the central frequency of the *passband*. 70/N μs average window centre
is set from 35/N μs after end of one transmitter ON state + 3 μs to 35/N
μs before start of next transmitter ON state- 3 μs. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

NOTE: Make sure that the measurement receiver is not overloaded.

#### 6.9.2.5 Test requirements

The measured mean EIRP spectral density shall be less than -33.1 +
P~rated,c,EIRP ~- P~rated,c,TRP~ dBm/MHz for carrier frequency 24.15 GHz
\< f ≤ 29.5 GHz, where P~rated,c,EIRP~ is the value declared for the
*reference beam direction pair* (D.6) for the beam identifier (D.3)
which provides the highest intended EIRP.

The measured mean EIRP spectral density shall be less than
-32.7 + P~rated,c,EIRP ~- P~rated,c,TRP~ dBm/MHz for carrier frequency
37 GHz \< f ≤ 43.5 GHz, where P~rated,c,EIRP~ is the value declared for
the *reference beam direction pair* (D.6) for the beam identifier (D.3)
which provides the highest intended EIRP.

The measured mean EIRP spectral density shall be less than
-32.4 + P~rated,c,EIRP ~- P~rated,c,TRP~ dBm/MHz for carrier frequency
43.5 GHz \< f ≤ 48.2 GHz, where P~rated,c,EIRP~ is the value declared
for the *reference beam direction pair* (D.6) for the beam identifier

7 Radiated performance requirements
===================================

7.1 NCR-MT performance requirements
-----------------------------------

### 7.1.1 General

#### 7.1.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *NCR-MT
type 2-O* to correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and
configurations. Radiated performance requirements are specified at the
RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the NCR-MT are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex H and the propagation
conditions in annex I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the NCR-MT.

The radiated performance requirements for *NCR-MT type 2-O* are limited
to two OTA *demodulations branches* as described in clause 7.1.1.2.
Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches* depending on the number of polarizations supported by the
NCR-MT, with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.

NOTE: NCR-MT can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*, however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches*.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single TAB connector (for
NCR-MT type 1-C).

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single TAB connector (for
NCR-MT type 1-C).

#### 7.1.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *NCR-MT type 2-O* uses polarization diversity and has the ability
to maintain isolation between the signals for each of the *demodulation
branches*, then radiated performance requirements can be tested for up
to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test setups). When
tested for two *demodulation branches*, each demodulation branch maps to
one polarization.

If the *NCR-MT type 2-O* does not use polarization diversity then
radiated performance requirements can only be tested for a single
*demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

### 7.1.2 Demodulation performance requirements

#### 7.1.2.1 General

##### 7.1.2.1.1 Applicability rule for NCR-MT

##### 7.1.2.1.1.1 General {#general-13 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for an NCR-MT declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for *NCR-MT type 2-O*), the performance
requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply, and
demodulation branches is up to NCR-MT implementation.

The tests requiring more than \[20\] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the
test requirements.

##### 7.1.2.1.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the tests shall apply only for each subcarrier
spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

##### 7.1.2.1.1.3 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns {#applicability-of-requirements-for-tdd-with-different-ul-dl-patterns .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if NCR-MT supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of
the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

#### 7.1.2.2 Performance requirements for PDSCH

##### 7.1.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex H.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to NCR-MT is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 7.1.2.1.1.

##### 7.1.2.2.2 Minimum requirements

For *NCR-MT type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 9.3.1.1.

##### 7.1.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

#### 7.1.3.2 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)

##### 7.1.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of CSI reporting is determined by the
reporting variance and the BLER performance using the transport format
indicated by the reported CQI. The purpose is to verify that the
reported CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in
TS 38.214 \[15\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the
reporting definition is considered to be verified if the reporting
accuracy is met for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an
offset of 1 dB.

##### 7.1.3.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *NCR-MT type 2-O* is in TS 38.106 \[2\]
clause 9.4.1.

##### 7.1.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to report correct median
CQI and expected BLER performance under AWGN conditions.

##### 7.1.3.2.4 Method of test

###### 7.1.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.x in table 4.6-1).

###### 7.1.3.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the NCR-MT with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.7.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
NCR-MT with the test system.

3\) Set the NCR-MT in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the NCR-MT tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test setup,
as shown in annex E.7. Each of the demodulation branch signals should be
transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).

5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding DL reference measurement channel defined
in annex H, and according to additional test parameters listed in table
7.1.3.2.4.2-1.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the NCR-MT receiver is as specified in clause 7.1.3.2.5.1, and
that the SNR at the NCR-MT receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 7.1.3.2.4.2-2.

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the repeater is to be tested are defined.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table B.2.1.

Table B.2-1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment

  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[7\];

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[8\];

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[9\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.1 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[12\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex A.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the repeater test environments defined in
annex A shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex D (normative): Calibration

For Repeater type 2-O and NCR type 2-O, OTA test requirements specific
and OTA measurement chamber specific calibration (and measurement)
procedures were captured in TR 37.941 \[13\] for the following
requirements sets:

\- TX directional requirements

\- within passband and out-of-passband TRP requirements.

######## Annex E (informative): OTA measurement system set-up

For the measurement setup for NCR-MT type 2-O, the existing measurement
setup in Annex E.1 of TS 38.176-2 \[21\] is applicable.

Figure E.1-1: Measuring system set-up for maximum EIRP testing

Note 1: The repeater is a bi-directional device. The signal generator
may need protection.

Note 2: The OTA chamber shown in figure E.1-1 is intended to be generic
and can be replaced with any suitable OTA chamber (Far field anechoic
chamber, etc.)

Note 3: UL/DL timing can be provided to the repeater.

Note 4: This is applicable for both repeater and NCR

Note 5: For NCR-MT conformance testing, testing signal for NCR-Fwd input
should be terminated.

######## Annex F (normative): In-channel TX tests

F.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the repeater under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

F.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a TDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 120 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 400
MHz (*N*~RB~ = 264). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

F.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling
rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it is named
![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png).

For FR2, *FFT size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.6.3.5-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5‑3 in \[5\] for 120 kHz SCS.
In the time domain it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a
signal with the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.6.3.5-3 in \[5\]. The sampling rate of 491.52 Msps is the product of
the *FFT size* and SCS.

F.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal ![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex F.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal ![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters for FR1 and FR2:

\- nominal demodulation reference signal and nominal PT-RS if present
(all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex F.2.1 in the time domain.

F.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency stability.

\- EVM.

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

F.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure G.2.4-1. The FFT
window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT size* + cyclic prefix length)
samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\" box.

For FR2, *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length is determined from
table 6.6.3.5-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5‑3 in \[5\]for 120 kHz
SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.6.3.5-2 and table
6.6.3.5-3 in \[5\]. Table F.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol
number and the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for
those two symbols according to the sampling rate.

Table F.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP
length for normal CP

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SCS (kHz)   Frequency Range   \# slots in subframe   Symbol \# and slot \# with longer CP   Longer CP length

                                                       (symbol 7, slot 0)                     

  30                            2                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 64
                                                       (symbol 0, slot 1)

                                                       (symbol 0, slot 2)                     

  60          FR2               4                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 32
                                                       (symbol 0, slot 2)                     

  120                           8                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 16
                                                       (symbol 0, slot 4)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4 has 256 more
samples in the cyclic prefix than the other symbols (the longer CP
length = 544).

F.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample timing, carrier frequency in
![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png) are varied in order to
minimise the difference between
![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png) and
![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png), after the amplitude
ratio of ![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png) and
![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) has been scaled. Best
fit (minimum difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value
between ![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png) and
![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) is an absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples in between the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequency error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinguish between both.

After this process the samples
![](./media/image23.png)![](./media/image23.png) are called
![](./media/image27.png)![](./media/image27.png).

F.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For TDD,
the number of FFTs performed is the number of downlink symbols in the
measurement interval.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 832 FFTs (i.e., 3,407,872 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 3,651,584 samples in 10 ms). There are
816 symbols with 4384 samples and 16 symbols with 4640 samples.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called
![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png),

\- ![](./media/image29.png)![](./media/image29.png), and

\- ![](./media/image30.png)![](./media/image30.png).

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from the transmission
bandwidth and table 6.6.3.5-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5-3 in
TS 38.104 \[5\] for 120 kHz SCS.

The repeater shall transmit a signal according to the test models
intended for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal
signal shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre FFT domain as
follows, using ![](./media/image27.png)![](./media/image27.png) and
![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png):

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal
![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png), the timing is known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal ![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png) is
a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the ideal signal
![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png) and the data in the
measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of
more than one highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the
measured signal.

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to
![](./media/image27.png)![](./media/image27.png). This subset of samples
is called ![](./media/image31.png)![](./media/image31.png).

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre
![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png) is determined according
to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal CP, there
are two values for ![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png) in a
1 ms period:

\- ![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png) = length of cyclic
prefix / 2,

\- ![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png) = Longer CP length -
length of cyclic prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.6.3.5-2 for
60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5-3 in TS 38.104 \[5\] for 120 kHz SCS, and
the longer CP length is obtained from table F.2.4-1.

As per the example values.

\- ![](./media/image32.png)![](./media/image32.png) within the CP of
length 288 for most OFDM symbols in 1 ms,

\- ![](./media/image33.png)![](./media/image33.png) (= 544 -- 144)
within the CP of length 544 for OFDM symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4.

F.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on ![](./media/image34.png)![](./media/image34.png) with the
FFT window timing ![](./media/image28.png)![](./media/image28.png).

The result is called ![](./media/image35.png)![](./media/image35.png).
The RE TX (RETP) power is then defined as:

$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$

where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP, the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$$\text{OSTP} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}â_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$

Where the summation accumulates
![](./media/image36.png)![](./media/image36.png) values of all *N~sym~*
OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not containing PDCCH, RS or SSB within
a slot.

![](./media/image37.png)![](./media/image37.png).

From the acquired samples
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) values for each OSTP
can be obtained and averaged where
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) is the number of slots
with downlink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval and is computed
according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1 in \[5\].

For the example used in the annex,
![](./media/image39.png)![](./media/image39.png) and
![](./media/image40.png)![](./media/image40.png).

F.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform ![](./media/image41.png)![](./media/image41.png) FFTs on
![](./media/image34.png)![](./media/image34.png), one for each OFDM
symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing to
produce an array of samples,
![](./media/image41.png)![](./media/image41.png) in the time axis *t* by
*FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 1120 FFTs are performed on
![](./media/image34.png)![](./media/image34.png). The result is an array
of samples, 1120 in the time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image42.png)![](./media/image42.png) and
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) are determined as
follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image35.png)![](./media/image35.png) and the
post-FFT ideal signal ![](./media/image44.png)![](./media/image44.png),
for each demodulation reference signal, over 10 ms measurement interval.
This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image45.png)![](./media/image45.png)

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image46.png)![](./media/image46.png) an unwrap operation
must be performed according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
![](./media/image46.png)![](./media/image46.png) by adding multiples of
2 \* π when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances
![](./media/image47.png)![](./media/image47.png) are greater than or
equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

![](./media/image48.png)![](./media/image48.png)

![](./media/image49.png)![](./media/image49.png)

\- Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signal time-domain
locations ![](./media/image47.png)![](./media/image47.png) from
![](./media/image35.png)![](./media/image35.png) for each demodulation
reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png) and
![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png) at the demodulation
reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving
average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged demodulation
reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window size is 19 and
averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when the number of
available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs
is smaller than the moving average window size, the window size is
reduced accordingly as per figure F.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png) and
![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png) to compute coefficients
![](./media/image42.png)![](./media/image42.png),
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png) for each subcarrier.

millimetre wave frequencies,

coefficients contain phase rotation due to the CPE,
![](./media/image55.png)![](./media/image55.png), in addition to the
phase of the equalizer coefficient
![](./media/image43.png)![](./media/image43.png), that is:

![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png)

For OFDM symbols where PT-RS does not exist,
![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png) can be estimated by
performing linear interpolation from neighboring symbols where PT-RS is
present.

In order to separate component of the
CPE,![](./media/image58.png)![](./media/image58.png), contained in,
![](./media/image54.png)![](./media/image54.png), estimation and
compensation of the CPE needs to

phase error (CPE), that rotates all the subcarriers of the OFDM symbol
at time ![](./media/image60.png)![](./media/image60.png).

Estimate of the CPE, ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png),
at OFDM symbol time, ![](./media/image60.png)![](./media/image60.png),
can then be obtained from using the PT-RS employing the expression:

![](./media/image61.png)![](./media/image61.png)

In the above equation, ![](./media/image62.png)![](./media/image62.png)
is the set of subcarriers where PT-RS are mapped,
![](./media/image63.png)![](./media/image63.png) where
![](./media/image64.png)![](./media/image64.png) is the set of OFDM
symbols where PT-RS are mapped while
![](./media/image65.png)![](./media/image65.png) and
![](./media/image66.png)![](./media/image66.png) are is the post-FFT
acquired signal and the ideal PT-RS signal respectively. That is,
estimate of the CPE at a given OFDM symbol is obtained from frequency
correlation of the complex ratios at the PT-RS positions with the
conjugate of the estimated equalizer complex coefficients. The estimated
CPE can be subtracted from
![](./media/image67.png)![](./media/image67.png) to remove influence of
the CPE, and obtain estimate of the complex coefficient\'s phase:

F.7 EVM
=======

F.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of
![](./media/image69.png)![](./media/image69.png), according to the
timing ![](./media/image70.png)![](./media/image70.png) and
![](./media/image71.png)![](./media/image71.png), using the equalizer
coefficients from F.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
![](./media/image24.png)![](./media/image24.png) (annex G.2.2) and are
called ![](./media/image72.png)![](./media/image72.png).

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

![](./media/image73.png)![](./media/image73.png)

Where:

\- *T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

\- ![](./media/image74.png)![](./media/image74.png) is the set of
subcarriers within the resource blocks with the considered modulation
scheme being active in symbol *t*,

\- ![](./media/image72.png)![](./media/image72.png) *is* the ideal
signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in accordance with
relevant test models,

\- ![](./media/image69.png)![](./media/image69.png) is the equalized
signal under test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

F.7.1 Averaged EVM
------------------

Let ![](./media/image75.png)![](./media/image75.png) be the number of
slots with downlink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For
TDD, the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from
![](./media/image75.png)![](./media/image75.png) slots of different 10
ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum of
![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) slots averaging length
where ![](./media/image38.png)![](./media/image38.png) is the number of
slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

![](./media/image76.png)![](./media/image76.png) is derived by: Square
the EVM results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares,
divide the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

![](./media/image77.png)![](./media/image77.png)

*Where* ![](./media/image78.png)![](./media/image78.png) is the number
of resource blocks with the considered modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The ![](./media/image79.png)![](./media/image79.png) is calculated,
using the maximum of ![](./media/image76.png)![](./media/image76.png)at
the window *W* extremities. Thus
![](./media/image80.png)![](./media/image80.png) is calculated using
![](./media/image81.png)![](./media/image81.png) and
![](./media/image82.png)![](./media/image82.png) is calculated
using![](./media/image83.png)![](./media/image83.png) (*l* and *h*, low

######## Annex I (normative): Propagation conditions

I.1 Static propagation condition
--------------------------------

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

I.1.1 NCR-MT Receiver with 2 Rx
-------------------------------

For 1 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](./media/image91.wmf){width="0.5069444444444444in"

For 2 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](./media/image92.wmf){width="0.8263888888888888in"
height="0.4513888888888889in"}.

I.1.2 NCR-MT Receiver with 4Rx
------------------------------

For 1 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by

.

For 2 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by

.

I.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
--------------------------------------------

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

\- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125GHz) and FR2-1
(24.25 GHz -- 52.6 GHz).

### I.2.1 Delay profiles

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[17\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in annex I.2.1.1 and I.2.1.2 can be used as such.

Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[17\].

Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[17\].

Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them
by calculating their linear power sum.

Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
taps as follows:

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise:

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

> \- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the
> identified neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference
> between the weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other
> side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8
dB)

Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of
the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

NOTE 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables I.2.1.1-2, I.2.1.1-3,
I.2.1.1-4, and I.2.1.2-2 for the corresponding model.

NOTE 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

The delay profiles for FR2-1 are specified in I.2.1.1-1 and the tapped

### I.2.2 Combinations of channel model parameters

The propagation conditions used for the performance measurements in
multi-path fading environment are indicated as a combination of a
channel model name and a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e.,
TDLA\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>, TDLB\<DS\>-\<Doppler\> or TDLC\<DS\>-\<Doppler\>
where \'\<DS\>\' indicates the desired delay spread and \'\<Doppler\>\'
indicates the maximum Doppler frequency (Hz).

Table I.2.2-1 and I.2.2-2 show the propagation conditions that are used
for the performance measurements in multi-path fading environment for
low, medium and high Doppler frequencies for FR1 and FR2, respectively.

The values in table I.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 high
correlation cases to ensure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a=0.00010.

medium and low correlation but performance requirements exist only for
low correlation.

#### I.2.3.2 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in I.2.3.2 apply to two
cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both UE and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

### I.3.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the transmission on antenna port(s)
![](./media/image157.png)![](./media/image157.png) is defined by using a
precoder matrix of size
![](./media/image159.png)![](./media/image159.png), where
![](./media/image160.png)![](./media/image160.png)is the number of
physical transmit antenna elements configured per test ,
![](./media/image161.png)![](./media/image161.png) is the number of
ports for a reference signal or physical channel configured per test,
and ![](./media/image162.png)![](./media/image162.png) is the first port
for that reference signal or physical channel as defined in clauses 7.3
and 7.4 in TS 38.211 \[18\]. This precoder takes as an input a block of
signals for antenna port(s)
![](./media/image157.png)![](./media/image157.png),
![](./media/image163.png)![](./media/image163.png), , with being the
number of modulation symbols per antenna port including the reference
signal symbols, and generates a block of signals

are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index pair as per the test
configuration but transmitted on different physical antenna elements:

![](./media/image168.png)

For Clause 6 and 8, the transmission of PDCCH and PDCCH DMRS on antenna
port ![](./media/image169.png)![](./media/image169.png) is defined by

block of signals for antenna port(s)
![](./media/image169.png)![](./media/image169.png),

elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index pair as
per the test configuration but transmitted on different physical antenna
elements:

The precoder matrix is specific to the test case configuration is
defined in Clause 5.2.2.2 of TS 38.214 \[15\].

precoder) with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS
antenna ports assigned for the PDSCH.

PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH) are directly mapped to first physical antenna
element.

*Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for tracking
with one port* are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.

*Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for beam
refinement with one port* are directly mapped to first physical antenna
element.

*Modulation symbols for NZP CSI-RS which configured for CSI acquisition
with* are *mapped to the physical antenna index* where is the number of
NZP CSI-RS ports configured per test.
