Foreword
========

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document is a technical report for High power UE (power
class m with 1\<m\<3) for a single FR1 band in UL of Dual Connectivity
(DC) combinations of x bands (x=1,2,3, 4 for y=1 or x=1, 2 for y=2) LTE
inter-band CA (xDL/1UL) and y bands NR inter-band CA (yDL/1UL) in the
Rel-18 time frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant background
information and studies to address relevant requirements for the Rel-18
EN-DC HPUE band combinations requested by proponents and captured in the
WID.

4 Background
============

The present document is a technical report for EN-DC HPUE band
combinations in the Rel-18 timeframe. The document covers each band
combination specific issues (i.e. one sub-clause defined per band
combination)

4.1 TR maintenance
------------------

A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the
contact person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related
to the band combination have been implemented.

5 EN-DC Power Class 2: Specific Band Combination Part
=====================================================

5.1 DC\_1\_n79
--------------

### 5.1.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3, so this section is omitted.

### 5.1.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_1\_n79, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[1\]. Based on above,

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 1.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic mixing do not fall
into Rx frequencies of band 1.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 1 and n79.

Therefore, there is no MSD issue for this DC configuration.

### 5.1.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

5.2 DC\_3\_n79

### 5.2.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3, so this section is omitted.

### 5.2.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_3\_n79, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[1\]. Based on above,

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 3.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic mixing do not fall
into Rx frequencies of band 3.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 3 and n79.

Therefore, there is no MSD issue for this DC configuration.

### 5.2.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

5.3 DC\_19\_n79

### 5.3.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS

### 5.3.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_19\_n79, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01. \[1\] Based on above,

the 5^th^ order harmonic mixing may fall into Rx frequencies of band 19.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 19.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, and 4^th^ order harmonic mixing do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 19.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 19 and n79.

For MSD due to 5th harmonic mixing, MSD value of PC2 case will be 3dB
higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD values are shown in Table 5.3.3-1
below. Uplink configuration is shown in Table 5.3.3-2 below.

### 5.3.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

5.4 DC\_21\_n79
---------------

### 5.4.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3, so this section is omitted.

### 5.4.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_21\_n79, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01. \[1\] Based on above,

the 3^rd^ order harmonic mixing may fall into Rx frequencies of band 21.

the 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band 21.

the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 21.

the 2^nd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic mixing do not fall into Rx
frequencies of band 21.

the 2^nd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not fall into Rx frequencies of
band 21 and n79.

For MSD due to 3rd harmonic mixing, MSD value of PC2 case will be 3dB
higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD values are shown in Table 5.4.3-1
below. Uplink configuration is shown in Table 5.4.3-2 below.

For MSD due to 3rd IMD, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st
order proportional of n79 UL power + 2nd order proportional of B21 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm+23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is
changed from 40MHz to 10MHz. Based on these, B21 UL power of PC2 case is
3dB higher than that of PC3 case, and n79 UL power of PC2 case is 9dB
higher than that of PC3 case. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be
15dB higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD values are shown in Table
5.4.3-3 below.

### 5.5.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n77 and PC2 DC\_1\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.5.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n77 and
DC\_1\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impact of the 3^rd^
band is the followings.

> the 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band
> 1 and band n77 may also fall into own Rx of band n79.
>
> the 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n79
> may also fall into own Rx of band n77.

However, IMD will not be an issue because the minimum requirements apply
only when there is non-simultaneous Rx/Tx operation between n77-n79 NR
carriers. Therefore, there is no MSD issue for this DC configuration.

### 5.8.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n78 and PC2 DC\_1\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.8.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n78 and
DC\_1\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impact of the 3^rd^
band is the followings.

> the 3^rd^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and
> band n78 may also fall into own Rx of band n79.
>
> the 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n79
> may also fall into own Rx of band n78.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm.
Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 9dB higher than that of PC3
case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.8.3-1 below.

Also, For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1
and band n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 4th order
proportional of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm+23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is
changed from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be
18dB higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.8.3-1 below.

### 5.9.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n78 and PC2 DC\_3\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.9.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n78 and
DC\_3\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impact of the 3^rd^
band is the followings.

> the 3^rd^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n78
> may also fall into own Rx of band n79.
>
> the 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n79
> may also fall into own Rx of band n78.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm.
Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 9dB higher than that of PC3
case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.9.3-1 below.

Also, For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1
and band n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order
proportional of band 1 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n79 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm+23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is
changed from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be
21dB higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.9.3-1 below.

### 5.10.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_21\_n78 and PC2 DC\_21\_n79, this section
can be omitted.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and

### 5.11.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n77 and PC2 DC\_21\_n77, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.11.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n77 and
DC\_21\_n77 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impact of the
3^rd^ band is the followings.

the 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and
band n77 may also fall into own Rx of band 21.

the 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n77 may also fall into own Rx of band 1.

Considering that Band 21 is currently operated only by a certain
operator in Japan, the frequency range can be limited as Band 1 UL/DL =
1940-1960/2130-2150 MHz and Band n77 UL/DL = 3600-4200/3600-4200 MHz.
Then own Rx impact can be simplified as below.

the 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n77 may
also fall into own Rx of band 21.

the 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n77 may also fall into own Rx of band 1.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n77 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm.
Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than that of PC3
case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.11.3-1 below.

Also, For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21
and band n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm+23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than
that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.11.3-1 below.

issue for this DC configuration.

### 5.13.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n77 and PC2 DC\_21\_n77, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.13.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n77 and
DC\_21\_n77 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impact of the
3^rd^ band is the followings.

> the 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and
> band n77 may also fall into own Rx of band 21.
>
> the 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
> band n77 may also fall into own Rx of band 3.

Considering that Band 21 is currently operated only by a certain
operator in Japan, the frequency range can be limited as Band n77 UL/DL
= 3600-4200/3600-4200 MHz. Therefore, own Rx impact can be simplified as
below.

> the 4^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n77
> may also fall into own Rx of band 21.
>
> the 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band n77
> may also fall into own Rx of band 3.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm.
Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 12dB higher than that of PC3
case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.13.3-1 below.

Also, For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21
and band n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 4th order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm+23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than
that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.13.3-1 below.

### 5.15.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to

issue for this DC configuration.

### 5.15.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

### 5.16.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3 \[2\], so this section is omitted.

### 5.16.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_1\_n77, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\]. Based on above,

> the 2^nd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of
> band 1.
>
> the 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of band
> n77.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic from PC2 UL band n77
> do not fall into Rx frequencies of band 1.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic mixing from PC2 UL
> band n77 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.
>
> the 3^rd^ order IMD do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.
>
> the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order IMD do not impact the Rx frequencies of band
> n77.

It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n77 (no
self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may
impact the concerning band.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to
1st order proportional of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of
band n77 UL power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is
assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB
higher than that of PC3 case.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD, MSD value for PC2 DC\_1A\_n77A can reuse
the value for PC2 DC\_1A\_n78A already specified in TS 38.101-3.

New MSD values are shown in Table 5.16.3-1 below.

### 5.17.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_3\_n77, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\]. Based on above,

> the 2^nd^ order harmonic mixing from PC2 UL band n77 may impact the Rx
> frequencies of band 3.
>
> the 2^nd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of
> band 3.
>
> the 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of band
> n77.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic from PC2 UL band n77
> do not fall into Rx frequencies of band 3.
>
> the 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic mixing from PC2 UL band n77
> do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.
>
> the 3^rd^ order IMD do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.
>
> the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order IMD do not impact the Rx frequencies of band
> n77.

It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n77 (no
self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may
impact the concerning band.

For MSD due to 2nd order harmonic mixing, MSD value of PC2 case will be
3dB higher than that of PC3 case. However, the MSD value is updated to
match re-analysed value in R4-2301133 \[4\] when the channel bandwidth
of UL n77 is 5MHz. New MSD values are shown in Table 5.17.3-1 below.
Uplink configuration is shown in Table 5.17.3-2 below.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD and 4th order IMD, MSD values for PC2
DC\_3A\_n77A can reuse the values for PC2 DC\_3A\_n78A already specified
in TS 38.101-3. MSD value is shown in Table 5.17.3-3 below.

### 5.17.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

----------------

### 5.18.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3 \[2\], so this section is omitted.

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_21\_n77, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\]. Based on above,

> the 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of band
> n77.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic from PC2 UL band n77
> do not fall into Rx frequencies of band 21.

>
> the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order IMD do not impact the Rx frequencies of band
> n77.

It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n77 (no
self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may
impact the concerning band. Therefore, there is no MSD issue for this DC
configuration.

### 5.18.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

### 5.19.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3 \[2\], so this section is omitted.

### 5.19.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_21\_n78, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\]. Based on above,

> the 4^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of band n78.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic from PC2 UL band n78
> do not fall into Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic mixing from PC2 UL
> band n78 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not impact the Rx
> frequencies of band 21.
>
> the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not impact the Rx frequencies
> of band n78.

It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n78 (no
self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may
impact the concerning band. Therefore, there is no MSD issue for this DC
configuration.

### 5.20.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n77 and PC2 DC\_3\_n77, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.20.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n77 and
DC\_3\_n77 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impact of the 3^rd^
band is the followings.

> the 2^nd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band
> 1 and band n77 may also impact the own Rx of band 3.
>
> the 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and
> band n77 may also impact the own Rx of band 1.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm.
Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than that of PC3
case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.20.3-1 below.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm.
Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 12dB higher than that of PC3
case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.20.3-1 below.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm+20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm+23dBm.
Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than that of PC3
case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.20.3-1 below.

5.21.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3, so this section is omitted.

### 5.23.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n78 and PC2 DC\_3\_n78, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.23.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n78 and
DC\_3\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 2nd and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
> n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.
>
> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n78 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than that of
PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.23.3-1 below.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than that of
PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.23.3-1 below.

### 5.25.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n78, this section can be omitted.

### 5.25.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n78 captured
in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as follows:

> the 4th and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
> n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 42.

However, IMD will not be an issue because there is non-simultaneous
Rx/Tx operation between band 42 and band n78. Therefore, there is no MSD
issue for this DC configuration.

### 5.25.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

### 5.27.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n79 and PC2 DC\_3\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.27.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n79 and
DC\_3\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
> n79 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.
>
> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 4th order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is changed
from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 21dB
higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.27.3-1
below.

### 5.28.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n79 and PC2 DC\_19\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.28.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n79 and
DC\_19\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 3rd and 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
> n79 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.
>
> the 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is changed
from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB
higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.28.3-1
below.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is
changed from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be
18dB higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.28.3-1 below.

### 5.29.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n79 and PC2 DC\_21\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.29.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n79 and
DC\_21\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band
> n79 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

Considering that Band 21 is currently operated only by a certain
operator in Japan, the frequency range can be limited as Band 1 UL/DL =
1940-1960/2130-2150MHz and Band n79 UL/DL = 4400-4900/4400-4900MHz. This
is based on the discussion when PC3 DC with the same configuration was
specified \[4\]. Therefore, own Rx impacts can be simplified as below:

> the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
> n79 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band
> n79 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

Based on the above, new MSD value is shown in Table 5.29.3-1 below.

### 5.30.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n79, this section can be omitted.

### 5.30.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n79 captured
in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as follows:

> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 42.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 4th order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is changed
from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 21dB
higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.30.3-1
below.

### 5.31.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n79 and PC2 DC\_19\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.31.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n79 and
DC\_19\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are follows:

> the 3rd and 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
> n79 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.
>
> the 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL power. PC3 DC

from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB
higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.31.3-1

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and

proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL

18dB higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table

### 5.32.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n79 and PC2 DC\_21\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.32.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n79 and
DC\_21\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are follows:

> the 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.

Considering that Band 21 is currently operated only by a certain
operator in Japan, the frequency range can be limited as Band n79 UL/DL
= 4400-4900/4400-4900MHz. This is based on the discussion when PC3 DC
with the same configuration was specified \[4\]. Therefore, own Rx
impacts can be simplified as below:

the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n79
do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.

the 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band n79 may
impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is
changed from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be
15dB higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.32.3-1 below.

### 5.33.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n79, this section can be omitted.

### 5.33.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n79 captured
in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as follows:

> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 42.

Considering actual spectrum holdings, the frequency range can be limited
as Band n79 UL/DL = 4500-5000/4500-5000MHz. This is based on the
discussion when PC3 DC with the same configuration was specified \[4\].
Therefore, own Rx impacts can be simplified as below:

the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n79
do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 42.

Therefore, MSD value is shown in Table 5.33.3-1 below.

### 5.34.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_19\_n79 and PC2 DC\_21\_n79, this section
can be omitted.

### 5.34.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_19\_n79 and
DC\_21\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are follows:

> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.

Considering that Band 21 is currently operated only by a certain
operator in Japan, the frequency range can be limited as Band n79 UL/DL
= 4400-4900/4400-4900MHz. This is based on the discussion when PC3 DC
with the same configuration was specified \[4\]. Therefore, own Rx
impacts can be simplified as below:

> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band
> n79 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 4th order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. In addition, PSD will be 6dB higher when UL CBW of n79 is
changed from 40MHz to 10MHz. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be
21dB higher than that of PC3 case. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.34.3-1 below.

### 5.35.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_19\_n79
captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as
follows:

> the 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 42.

Considering that Band 19 is currently operated only by a certain
operator in Japan, the frequency range can be limited as Band n79 UL/DL
= 4500-4600/4500-4600MHz. This is based on the discussion when PC3 DC
with the same configuration was specified \[4\]. Therefore, own Rx
impacts can be simplified as below:

> the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band
> n79 do not impact the Rx frequencies of band 42.

Therefore, MSD value is shown in Table 5.35.3-1 below.

### 5.36.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_21\_n79
captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as
follows:

> the 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band n79 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 42.

Considering that Band 21 is currently operated only by a certain
operator in Japan, the frequency range can be limited as Band n79 UL/DL
= 4500-4600/4500-4600MHz. This is based on the discussion when PC3 DC

impacts can be simplified as below:

> the IMDs up to 5th order generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band

----------------

### 5.39.1 Configuration for DC

For DC\_19A\_n77A, EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL without intra-band CA,
so it is not needed to update the inter-band EN-DC configuration table.
By referring to the maximum output power table, it can be checked
whether these configurations support PC2. This band combination for PC3
is already specified in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], so this section is skipped.

On the other hand, for DC\_19A\_n77(2A), it is needed to update the
inter-band EN-DC configuration table. The table is shown below.

### 5.39.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_19\_n77, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[4\]. Based on above,

> the 4^th^ order harmonic mixing from PC2 UL band n77 may impact the Rx
> frequencies of band 19.
>
> the 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of band
> 19.
>
> the 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of band
> n77.

For MSD due to 4th order harmonic mixing, MSD value of PC2 case will be
3dB higher than that of PC3 case. Using the above simple calculation as
a baseline, we reanalyzed the MSD values for PC2. New MSD values are
shown in Table 5.39.3-1 below. Uplink configuration is shown in Table
5.39.3-2 below.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 12dB higher than
that of PC3 case. Using the above simple calculation as a baseline, we
reanalyzed the MSD values for PC2. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.39.3-3 below.

It should be noted that IMD will not be an issue for band n77 (no
self-interference for the TDD band) even through the IMD products may
fall into the concerning band.

### 5.39.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

5.40 DC\_19\_n78
----------------

### 5.40.1 Configuration for DC

For DC\_19A\_n78A, EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL without intra-band CA,
so it is not needed to update the inter-band EN-DC configuration table.
By referring to the maximum output power table, it can be checked
whether these configurations support PC2. This band combination for PC3
is already specified in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], so this section is skipped.

On the other hand, for DC\_19A\_n78(2A), it is needed to update the
inter-band EN-DC configuration table. The table is shown below.

### 5.40.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. For PC3 DC\_19\_n78, the co-existence study is
provided in TR 37.863-01-01 \[4\]. Based on above,

> the 4^th^ order harmonic mixing from PC2 UL band n78 may impact the Rx
> frequencies of band 19.
>
> the 4^th^ order IMD may impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.

For MSD due to 4th order harmonic mixing, MSD value of PC2 case will be
3dB higher than that of PC3 case. Using the above simple calculation as
a baseline, we reanalyzed the MSD values for PC2. New MSD values are
shown in Table 5.40.3-1 below. Uplink configuration is shown in Table
5.40.3-2 below.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 12dB higher than
that of PC3 case. Using the above simple calculation as a baseline, we
reanalyzed the MSD values for PC2. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.40.3-3 below.

### 5.41.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n77 and PC2 DC\_19\_n77, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.41.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n77 and
DC\_19\_n77 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n77 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.
>
> the 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n77 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n77 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than that of
PC3 case.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 9dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

Using the above simple calculation as a baseline, we reanalyzed the MSD
values for PC2. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.41.3-1 below.

### 5.42.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n78 and PC2 DC\_19\_n78, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.42.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n78 and
DC\_19\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n78 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.
>
> the 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n78 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than that of
PC3 case.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 9dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

Using the above simple calculation as a baseline, we reanalyzed the MSD
values for PC2. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.42.3-1 below.

### 5.44.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n78 and PC2 DC\_19\_n78, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.44.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n78 and
DC\_19\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band n78 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 9dB higher than
that of PC3 case. Using the above simple calculation as a baseline, we
reanalyzed the MSD values for PC2. New MSD value is shown in Table
5.44.3-1 below.

### 5.45.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_19\_n77 and
DC\_21\_n77 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd

>
> the 3rd and 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band
> n77 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 12dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n77, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n77 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 9dB higher than

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and

### 5.46.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_19\_n78 and PC2 DC\_21\_n78, this section
can be omitted.

### 5.46.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_19\_n78 and
DC\_21\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 3rd and 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band
> n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 19.

For MSD due to 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 2nd order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 9dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 12dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

Based on above, new MSD value is shown in Table 5.46.3-1 below.

DC\_19\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band
> 19 and band n77 may impact the Rx frequencies of band n79.
>
> the 2nd and 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band
> n79 may impact the Rx frequencies of band n77.

However, IMD will not be an issue because the minimum requirements apply
only when there is non-simultaneous Rx/Tx operation between n77-n79 NR
carriers. Therefore, there is no MSD issue for this DC configuration.

### 5.50.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_19\_n78 and PC2 DC\_19\_n79, this section
can be omitted.

### 5.50.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_19\_n78 and
DC\_19\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[2\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band
> 19 and band n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band n79.
>
> the 2nd and 3rd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and band
> n79 may impact the Rx frequencies of band n78.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 19 and
band n79, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order
proportional of band 19 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n79 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

Based on above, new MSD value is shown in Table 5.50.3-1 below.

### 5.51.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n78 and PC2 DC\_21\_n78, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.51.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n78 and
DC\_21\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 2nd and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
> n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the 2nd and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band
> n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 1.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than that of
PC3 case.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 1 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than that of
PC3 case.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 4th order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

Using the above simple calculation as a baseline, we reanalyzed the MSD
values for PC2. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.51.3-1 below.

### 5.52.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n78 and PC2 DC\_21\_n78, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.52.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n78 and
DC\_21\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01 \[3\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd
band are as follows:

> the 4th and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
> n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band 21.
>
> the 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and band n78 may
> impact the Rx frequencies of band 3.

For MSD due to 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 12dB higher than that of
PC3 case.

For MSD due to 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band
n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 3rd order proportional
of band 3 UL power + 2nd order proportional of band n78 UL power. PC3 DC
is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be 23dBm +
23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 15dB higher than that of
PC3 case.

For MSD due to 2nd order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 21 and
band n78, the MSD value can be seen as dB related to 1st order
proportional of band 21 UL power + 1st order proportional of band n78 UL
power. PC3 DC is assumed to be 20dBm + 20dBm and PC2 DC is assumed to be
23dBm + 23dBm. Therefore, MSD value of PC2 case will be 6dB higher than
that of PC3 case.

Using the above simple calculation as a baseline, we reanalyzed the MSD
values for PC2. New MSD value is shown in Table 5.52.3-1 below.

### 5.55.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n77 and
DC\_8\_n77, own Rx impact of the 3^rd^ band is the followings.

the 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n77 may
also impact the own Rx of band 8.

the 3^nd^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 8 and band n77 may
also impact the own Rx of band 1.

### 5.57.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_3\_n77 and PC2 DC\_8\_n77, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.57.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n77 and
DC\_8\_n77, own Rx impact of the 3^rd^ band is the followings.

> the 4^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n77
> may also impact the own Rx of band 8.
>
> the 3^rd^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 8 and band n77
> may also impact the own Rx of band 3.

The new MSDs are specified in below table.

### 5.58.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3, so this section is omitted.

### 5.58.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC.

> The 4^th^ order harmonic of band 8 fall into Rx frequencies of n77,
> but band 8 can only support PC3 so no need to introduce PC2 MSD due to
> harmonic.
>
> The 4th harmonic mixing falls into Rx frequencies of band 8, but it is
> not defined for PC3 due to even order is not mandatory to be defined
> so same applies for PC2
>
> The 4^th^ order IMD fall into Rx frequencies of band 8.
>
> No cross band isolation interference.

New PC2 MSDs are defined in the following tables.

Note: The Uplink configuration for reference sensitivity exception table
is omitted here which is the same as for PC3.

### 5.61.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC.

> No new harmonic issue since band 18 can only transmit PC3.
>
> the 3^rd^ order harmonic mixing may fall into Rx frequencies of band
> 18.
>
> IMD3 of dual UL may fall into Rx frequencies of band 18.
>
> No cross band isolation interference.
>
> There is no IMD defined for PC3, so same principle applies for PC2.
>
> MSD due to harmonic mixing is defined as below.
>
> New PC2 MSD is defined in the following tables.

### 5.62.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC.

> No new harmonic issue since band 18 can only transmit PC3.
>
> the 4^th^ order harmonic mixing may fall into Rx frequencies of band
> 18.
>
> IMD4/5 of dual UL may fall into Rx frequencies of Band 18.
>
> No cross band isolation interference.
>
> There is the 4^th^ order harmonic mixing, which is not mandatory to be
> defined according to Rel-16 agreement.
>
> Similar with PC3 CA\_n18-n77 and DC\_18\_n77, as clarified by note 8
> in table 7.3A.5-1, there is no need to define exact values for IMD4/5.
>
> New PC2 MSDs are defined in the following tables.

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC.

Table 5.64.3.2-1 lists up to 7^th^ harmonics for 2\_n78 which shows that
there are 2nd harmonics issues from UL 2 into DL n78. MSD is defined for
PC3 and is not needed to PC2 (since band 2 is not HPUE).

Table 5.64.3.2-2 list harmonic mixing issue for the 2DL bands DC. As can
be seen there are no harmonic mixing issues.

Co-existence studies for DC\_2\_n78 shows that the 2^nd^, 4^th^, and
5^th^ order IMD might fall into Rx frequencies of band 2. PC2 MSD values
is reused from CA\_n2-n77.

for PC3 and is not needed to PC2 (since band 5 is not HPUE).

Table 5.65.3.2-2 list harmonic mixing issue for the 2DL bands DC. As can
be seen there are 4^th^ harmonic mixing issues from DL 5 into UL n78.
MSD is defined for PC3 and is needed for PC2. MSD values are derive from
CA\_n5-n77.

Co-existence studies for DC\_5\_n78 shows that the 4^th^ order IMD might
fall into Rx frequencies of band 5. PC2 MSD values is reused from
CA\_n5-n78.

Table 5.67.3.2-1 lists up to 7^th^ harmonics for 2\_n78 which shows that
there are 2nd harmonics issues from UL 66 into DL n78. MSD is defined
for PC3 and is not needed to PC2 (since band 66 is not HPUE).

Table 5.67.3.2-2 list harmonic mixing issue for the 2DL bands DC. As can
be seen there are no harmonic mixing issues.

Co-existence studies for DC\_66\_n78 shows that the 5^th^ order IMD
might fall into Rx frequencies of band 66. PC2 MSD values is reused from
CA\_n66-n77.

Table 5.68.3.2-2 list harmonic mixing issue for the 2DL bands DC. As can
be seen there are no harmonic mixing issues.

Co-existence studies for DC\_71\_n78 shows that the 5^th^ order IMD
might fall into Rx frequencies of band 71. PC2 MSD values is reused from
DC\_71A\_n77A.

### 5.69.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_2\_n78 and PC2 DC\_7\_n78, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.69.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Coexistence studies show that UL 2\_n78 does not give IMD into band 7
DL.

Coexistence studies show that UL 7\_n78 give 4^th^ order IMD into band 2
DL.

MSD value for band 2 is derived from PC2 MSD values for CA\_n25-n41-n77.

### 5.73.2 Maximum output power for DC

The maximum output power requirement for PC2 UL DC\_8\_n77 is already
specified in Table 6.2B.1.3-1 in TS38.101-3\[3\]. So, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.73.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_8\_n1-n77 could
be reused from DC\_1-8\_n77 captured to 5.55.3 in TR38.898\[5\], own Rx
impacts of the 3^rd^ band are as follows:

higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_8\_n77 captured
in TR 37.863-01-01\[7\], own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as follows:

the 4th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 8 and band n77 may
fall into Rx frequencies of band n28.

### 5.78.2 Maximum output power for DC

Since the maximum output power requirement for PC2 UL DC\_3\_n77 and
DC\_28\_n77 are already specified in the specification, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.78.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC.

> IMD3 of dual UL DC\_3A\_n77A may fall into Rx frequencies of band n28.
>
> IMD3/4 of dual UL DC\_28A\_n77A may fall into Rx frequencies of band
> n3.

The MSD values reused the values for PC2 CA\_n3-n28-n77 in the
specifications.

New PC2 MSDs are defined in the following tables.

higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of PC3 DC\_8-42\_n77
defined to 5.1.60.3 in TR37.716-21-11~\[8\]~, there is no MSD issue for
this configuration based on the following conditions.

> \- LTE Band 42 and NR Band n77 are synchronized.
>
> \- Simultaneous transmission of LTE Band 42 and NR Band n77 are not
> supported.

### 5.79.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

5.80 DC\_8\_n79
---------------

### 5.80.1 Configuration for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in
Table5.5B.4.1-1 in TS 38.101-3~\[3\]~.

### 5.80.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_8\_n79 could be
reused from CA\_n8\_n79 referring to 5.18.3 in TR38.899~\[6\]~.

5^th^ order harmonic of band 8 may fall into Rx frequencies of band 79
causing de-sensing.

For the IMD issue also could be reused from CA\_n8\_n79 referring to
Table 5.18.3.1-1 in TR38.899~\[6\]~.

### 5.81.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_8\_n79, this section can be omitted.

### 5.81.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_8\_n79 captured
in TR 37.863-01-01~\[7\]~, own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as
follows:

4^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 8 and band n79 may fall
into Rx frequencies of band n1.

### 5.84.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_8\_n77 and DC\_8\_n79, this section can be
omitted.

### 5.84.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_8\_n77 and
DC\_8\_79 captured in TR 37.863-01-01~\[7\]~, own Rx impacts of the 3rd
bands are as follows:

> 2^nd^ order IMD generated by band 8 and band n77 may fall into Rx of
> bands n77 and n79. However, TDD band does not transmit and receive
> simultaneously in a single band, thus the own band of n77 would not be
> interfered.
>
> 2^nd^ order IMD generated by band 8 and band n79 may also fall into Rx
> of band n77.
>
> 3^rd^ order IMD generated by band 8 and band n79 may also fall into Rx
> of band n79. However, TDD band does not transmit and receive
> simultaneously in a single band, thus the own band of n79 would not be
> interfered.

However, IMD will not be an issue because the minimum requirements apply
only when there is non-simultaneous Rx/Tx operation between n77-n79 NR
carriers. Therefore, there is no MSD issue for this DC configuration.

Regarding the triple beat issue, as based on the analysis for PC3
captured in TR 37.718-11-11, since the two bands in the UL DC\_8B\_n78A
are not in the same band group or belong to adjacent band groups, it can
be concluded that there is no triple beat issue, and no additional MSD
is needed.

### 5.86.2 Maximum output power for DC

Since the maximum output power requirements for DC\_1\_n77 have already
been specified, this section can be omitted.

### 5.86.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n77, own Rx
impact of the 3^rd^ band is the followings.

> 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band
> n77 may also impact the own Rx of band 41.

### 5.88.2 Maximum output power for DC

Since the maximum output power requirement for PC2 DC\_1\_n77 has
already been specified, this section can be omitted.

### 5.88.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n28 and
DC\_1\_n77, own Rx impact of the 3^rd^ band is the followings.

> the 3^rd^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n28
> may impact the downlink of band n77.
>
> the 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 1 and band n77
> may also impact the own Rx of band n28.

The new MSDs are specified in the table below.

### 5.91.2 Maximum output power for DC

Based on studies of PC2 DC\_1\_n79 and PC3 DC\_11\_n79, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.91.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_1\_n79 and
DC\_11\_n79 captured in TR 37.863-01-0 ~\[6\]~, own Rx impact of the
3^rd^ band is the followings.

### 5.97.3 REFSENS requirements

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. *Interference impact is identified as follows:*

> The 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic do not fall into Rx
> frequencies of n77.
>
> The UL2/DL3 harmonic mixing falls into Rx frequencies of band 40.
>
> The UL3/DL2 harmonic mixing falls into RX frequencies of band n77.
>
> The 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not fall into Rx
> frequencies of band 40 and n77 since both bands are TDD.
>
> Cross band isolation existing, the interference from n77 UL falls into
> band 40 DL.

New MSDs are defined in the following tables.

### 5.98.3 REFSENS requirements

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. *Interference impact is identified as follows:*

> The 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order harmonic do not fall into Rx
> frequencies of n78.
>
> The UL2/DL3 harmonic mixing falls into Rx frequencies of band 40.
>
> The UL3/DL2 harmonic mixing falls into RX frequencies of band n78.
>
> The 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not fall into Rx
> frequencies of band 40 and n78 since both bands are TDD.
>
> Cross band isolation existing, the interference from n78 UL falls into
> band 40 DL.

New MSDs are defined in the following tables.

MSD due to cross band isolation for PC2 for UL band n78 and DL band 40
is already added to TS38.101-3. However, the value is too high (i.e.,
11.6dB) which is apparently irrelevant given that band isolation for PC2
for: UL band n77 and DL band 41; UL band n78 and DL band 41; UL band n77
and DL band 40; UL band n77 and DL band 41 are all 6.5. Hence, a new MSD
value, i.e., 6.5dB, is added to Table 5.98.3.2-2 for UL band n78 and DL
band 40 accordingly.

### 5.98.4 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 CA, so this
section is omitted.

### 5.99.2 Maximum output power for DC

Since the maximum output power requirements for PC2 UL DC\_1\_n77 and
DC\_18\_n77 are already specified in the specification, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.99.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC.

### 5.100.2 Maximum output power for DC

Since the maximum output power requirements for PC2 UL DC\_3\_n77 and
DC\_18\_n77 are already specified in the specification, this section can
be omitted.

### 5.100.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC.

IMD3 of dual UL DC\_18\_n77 may fall into Rx frequencies of band 3.

> New PC2 MSD is defined in the following table by reusing the MSD of

### 5.101.1 Configurations for DC

When requested EN-DC configuration is 2DL2UL, it is not needed to update
the inter-band EN-DC configuration table. By referring to the maximum
output power table, it can be checked whether these configurations
support PC2. This band combination for PC3 is already specified in TS
38.101-3, so this section is omitted.

### 5.101.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. *Interference impact is identified as follows:*

> The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th order harmonic do not fall into Rx
> frequencies of band 11.
>
> The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th order harmonic mixing do not fall into Rx
> frequencies of band 11.
>
> The 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, and 5^th^ order IMD do not fall into Rx
> frequencies of band 11.
>
> No new cross band isolation interference.

No need to define new MSDs.

### 5.102.2 Maximum output power for DC

Since the maximum output power requirement for PC2 UL DC\_3\_n78 is
already specified in the specification, this section can be omitted.

### 5.102.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01,
own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as follows:

> No IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n78 will fall into
> the Rx frequencies of band n8.

No additional MSD is needed for PC2 UL DC\_3\_n78 support on these
configurations.

### 5.102.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.

### 5.103.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Based on co-existence studies of DC\_7\_n78 captured in TR 37.863-01-01,
own Rx impacts of the 3rd band are as follows:

> The 2^nd^ and 5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 7 and
> band n78 may impact the Rx frequencies of band n8.

The MSD values for IMD2 reused the value for PC2 DC\_7A-8A\_n78A in the
current specifications. Note that the IMD5 is not specified based on the
same approach as the corresponding PC3 combination.

### 5.104.2 Maximum output power for DC

Since the maximum output power requirements for DC\_3\_n77 have already
been specified, this section can be omitted.

### 5.104.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. Based on co-existence studies of DC\_3\_n77, own Rx
impact of the 3^rd^ band is the followings.

5th order IMD generated by dual uplink of band 3 and band n77 may also
impact the own Rx of band 41.

The new MSD is specified in below table, which is reused from PC2
CA\_n3-n41-n77.

### 5.106.2 Maximum output power for DC

The maximum output power requirement for PC2 UL DC\_18\_n77 is defined
as Table 6.2B.1.3-1 in TS38.101-3 \[2\]. So, this section can be
omitted.

### 5.106.3 REFSENS requirements for DC

Analysis of REFSENS exceptions or MSD requirements is needed due to
higher power UL DC. There is no MSD issue for this configuration because
LTE Band 42 and NR Band n77 are synchronized, and that simultaneous
transmission of LTE Band 42 and NR Band n77 are not supported.

### 5.106.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

There is no change by comparing to the values for PC3 DC, so this
section is omitted.Annex A - Change history
