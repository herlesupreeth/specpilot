=========

4.1 General aspects
-------------------

The PDU Session User Plane protocol and PDU Set Information User Plane
protocol are located in the User Plane of the Radio Network Layer above
the Transport Network Layer of the interface.

Each PDU session User Plane protocol instance and PDU Set Information
User Plane protocol instance are associated to one PDU Session.

In this version of the specification, the PDU Session User Plane
protocol data is conveyed by GTP-U protocol means, more specifically, by
means of the \"PDU Session Container\" GTP-U Extension Header as defined
in TS 29.281 \[3\].

In this version of the specification, the PDU Set Information User Plane
protocol data is conveyed by GTP-U protocol means, more specifically, by
means of the \"PDU Set Information Container\" GTP-U Extension Header as
defined in TS 29.281 \[3\].

5 PDU Session user plane protocol
=================================

5.1 General
-----------

The PDU session UP layer uses the services of the Transport Network
Layer in order to send its packets over the interface.

5.2 PDU Session user plane protocol layer services
--------------------------------------------------

The following functions are provided by the PDU Session User Plane
protocol:

\- Provision of control information elements (e.g. QFI, RQI) associated
with a PDU session.

5.3 Services expected from the Transport Network Layer
------------------------------------------------------

The PDU session UP layer expects the following services from the
Transport Network Layer:

\- Transfer of PDU session User Plane PDUs.

5.4 Elementary procedures
-------------------------

### 5.4.1 Transfer of DL PDU Session Information 

#### 5.4.1.1 Successful operation

The purpose of the Transfer of DL PDU Session Information procedure is
to send control information elements related to the PDU Session from UPF
to NG-RAN.

In the case of uplink and downlink data forwarding the DL PDU Session
Information procedure shall also be used to send control information
elements related to the PDU Session from NG-RAN node to UPF, or from UPF
to NG-RAN node, or between NG-RAN nodes.

A PDU Session user plane instance making use of the Transfer of DL PDU
Session Information procedure is associated to a single PDU Session. The
Transfer of DL PDU Session Information procedure may be invoked whenever
packets for that particular PDU Session need to be transferred across
the related interface instance.

The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame includes a QoS Flow Identifier
(QFI) field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall use
the received QFI to determine the QoS flow and QoS profile which are
associated with the received packet.

The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame shall include the Reflective QoS
Indicator (RQI) field to indicate whether user plane Reflective QoS
shall be activated or not. The NG-RAN shall, if RQA has been configured
for the involved QoS flow as specified in TS 38.413 \[7\], take the RQI
into account as specified in TS 37.324 \[4\].

The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a Paging Policy
Indicator (PPI) field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN
shall use the received PPI to determine the paging policy
differentiation which is associated with the received packet as
described in TS 23.501 \[5\].

The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a QoS Monitoring
Packet (QMP) field and a DL sending time stamp field. The NG-RAN shall,
if QoS monitoring has been configured for the included QFI field,
perform delay measurement and QoS monitoring, as specified in TS 23.501
\[5\].

The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a DL QFI Sequence
Number field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall,
if the QoS flow has been configured eligible for redundant transport
bearer in TS 38.413 \[6\], use the received DL QFI Sequence Number field
to determine and eliminate duplicated packets for a given QoS flow as
specified in TS 23.501 \[5\].

The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a DL MBS QFI
Sequence Number field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN
shall use the received DL MBS QFI Sequence Number field to determine the
PDCP count that should be used when transferring the packet over the
radio as specified in TS 38.300 \[2\].

When needed, the NG-RAN shall propagate the DL PDU Session Information
to a peer NG-RAN.

#### 5.4.1.2 Unsuccessful operation

Void.

### 5.4.2 Transfer of UL PDU Session Information 

#### 5.4.2.1 Successful operation

The purpose of the Transfer of UL PDU Session Information procedure is
to send control information elements related to the PDU Session from
NG-RAN to UPF.

An UL PDU Session user plane instance making use of the Transfer of UL
PDU Session Information procedure is associated to a single PDU Session.
The Transfer of UL PDU Session Information procedure may be invoked
whenever packets for that particular PDU Session need to be transferred
across the related interface instance.

The UL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame includes a QoS Flow Identifier
(QFI) field associated with the transferred packet.

If QoS monitoring has been requested for the included QFI field, the UL
PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may include a QoS Monitoring Packet (QMP)
field, a DL Sending Time Stamp Repeated field, a DL Receiving Time Stamp
field, a UL Sending Time Stamp field, and/or Delay Result for UL or DL.
If QoS monitoring with N3/N9 delay reporting has been requested for the
included QFI field, the I-UPF may include in the UL PDU SESSION
INFORMATION frame a N3/N9 Delay Ind. field, a N3/N9 Delay Result field
and delay result for UL and DL if received from the RAN. The UPF shall,
if supported, use this information to calculate UL, DL, or RTT delay as
specified in TS 23.501 \[5\].

The UL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a UL QFI Sequence
Number field associated with the transferred packet. The UPF shall, if
the QoS flow has been configured eligible for redundant transport bearer
in TS 38.413 \[6\], use the received UL QFI Sequence Number field to
determine and eliminate duplicated packets for a given QoS flow as
specified in TS 23.501 \[5\].

If the ECN Marking or Congestion Information Reporting Status is active
for a QoS flow indicated by the QFI field, the UL PDU SESSION
INFORMATION frame should include an UL Congestion Information field
and/or a DL Congestion Information field. The UPF shall, if supported,
use this information to perform ECN marking at UPF or information
exposure as specified in TS 23.501 \[5\].

+------------------+--------------------+---------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+

Figure 5.5.1-1: Example frame format

Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within
an octet have the most significant bit located at the higher bit
position (indicated above frame in figure 5.5.1-1). In addition, if a
field spans several octets, most significant bits are located in lower
numbered octets (right of frame in figure 5.5.1-1).

On the NG interface, the frame is transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according to
decreasing bit position (bit position 7 first).

Spare bits should be set to \"0\" by the sender and should not be
checked by the receiver.

The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet aligned (by adding \'Padding Bits\' when needed).

The receiver should be able to remove an additional Future Extension
field that may be present.\
See description of Future Extension field in A.1.

Padding octets may be added at the end of the frame, see Padding in
5.5.3.5.

### 5.5.2 Frame format for the PDU Session user plane protocol

#### 5.5.2.1 DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION (PDU Type 0)

This frame format is defined to allow the NG-RAN to receive some control
information elements which are associated with the transfer of a packet

6.4 Elementary procedures
-------------------------

### 6.4.1 Transfer of DL PDU Set Information 

#### 6.4.1.1 Successful operation

The purpose of the Transfer of DL PDU Set Information procedure is to
send PDU Set information and indication of End of Data Burst related to
a QoS flow from UPF to NG-RAN node or between NG-RAN nodes, or from
gNB-CU to gNB-DU.

The DL PDU SET INFORMATION frame includes a QoS Flow Identifier (QFI)
field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall use the
received QFI to determine the QoS flow and QoS profile which are
associated with the received packet.

The DL PDU SET INFORMATION frame includes PDU Set Sequence Number, PDU
Sequence Number within a PDU Set, PDU Set Importance, End of Data Burst
and End PDU of the PDU Set as specified in TS 23.501 \[5\].

The DL PDU SET INFORMATION frame may include PDU Set Size as specified
in TS 23.501 \[5\].

the New IE 1 is present or not. New IE flag 1 indicates if the new IE 2
is present or not.

A.1.1 New IE Flags
------------------

**Description:** The *New IE Flags* IE is only present if at least one
new IE is present. The *New IE Flags* IE contains flags indicating which
new IEs that are present following the *New IE Flags* IE. The last bit
position of the *New IE Flags* IE is used as the Extension Flag to allow
the extension of the *New IE Flags* IE in the future. Extension octets
of the *New IE Flags* IE shall follow directly after the first octet of
the *New IE Flags* IE. When an extension octet of the *New IE Flags* IE
is present, then all previous extension octets of the *New IE Flags* IE
and the *New IE Flags* IE shall also be present, even if they have all
their flag bits indicating no presence of their respective new IEs.
