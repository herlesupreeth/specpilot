 Foreword
========

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope

4 Background
============

At 3GPP RAN\#97-e meeting, a basket Work Item on "High power UE (power
class 1.5 or 2) for intra-band Carrier Aggregation combinations of a
single NR FR1 TDD band" \[2\] was approved for Rel-18. The objectives of
the core part are as follows:

This WI will address the following intra-band Carrier Aggregation cases
of a single NR FR1 TDD band:

\- with PC2 for UL intra-band CA configuration

\- with PC2 for single uplink carrier

\- with PC1.5 for single uplink carrier

\- with the following objectives:

1\) Specify the band-combination specific RF requirements including

a\) UE maximum output power and Tx power tolerance

b\) A-MPR requirements if needed

2\) Define requirements for PC1.5 according to following conditions

a\) Include intra-band DL CA band combinations with PC1.5 on the single
carrier uplink in supporting of 2x26dBm PA configuration.

Note 0: Other additional requirements due to the high power on UL may be
added via WID revisions, if necessary.

Note 1: The generic requirements of high power UEs for the band
combinations considered in this WI are covered in REL-17
NR\_RF\_FR1\_enh.

Note 2: RAN4 will not apply its block agreement process to CRs of this
basket WI.

The **NR** intra-band CA band combination configurations of frequency
range FR1 that are considered in this WI are **defined in the Table 1
below:**
