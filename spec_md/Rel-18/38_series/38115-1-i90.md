Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for RF repeater *type 1-C, network controlled
repeater type (NCR) 1-C and 1-H*. These have been derived from, and are
consistent with the conducted requirements for *repeater type 1-C,
network controlled repeater type 1-C and 1-H* in NR repeater
specification defined in TS 38.106 \[2\].

RF *repeater type 1-C and NCR type 1-C* only have conducted requirements
so they require compliance to this specification only.

*NCR type 1-H* has both conducted and radiated requirements so it
requires compliance to this specification and TS 38.115-2 \[3\].

*RF repeater type 2-O* and*NCR type 2-O* have only radiated requirements
so they require compliance to TS 38.115-2 \[3\] only.

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1
of this specification, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1. The
frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of
TS 38.106 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.106 \[2\]. Test Tolerances
for the conducted test requirements explicitly stated in the present
document are given in annex C of the present document.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545
\[11\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this
may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure
that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1.2 had
been used.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

4.5 Repeater configurations
---------------------------

### 4.5.1 General configurations

For *repeater type 1-C* and *NCR type 1-C*, the requirements are applied
at the repeater *antenna connector* (BS-side connector or UE-side
connector) for downlink or uplink for the configuration in normal
operating conditions.

For NCR type 1-H, the requirements are applied at the repeater *TAB
connectors* (BS-side connector or UE-side connectors) for downlink or
uplink for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

### 4.5.2 Transmission with multiple BS-side antenna connectors for RF repeater and NCR type 1-C

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each BS-side *antenna connector*
in the case of transmission with multiple BS-side *antenna connectors*.

Requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the remaining
*antenna connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the antenna connectors to be equivalent (D.13), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the BS-side *antenna
connectors*.

### 4.5.2A Transmission with multiple BS-side antenna connectors for NCR type 1-H

The manufacturer shall declare a set of the input/output pairs and/or
groups to indicate the mapping between input-side and output-side TAB
connectors. The set of declared input/output pairs and/or groups should
include all TAB connectors.

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each BS-side *TAB connector* group
in the case of transmission with multiple BS-side *TAB connectors*
groups.

Requirements are tested at the *TAB connectors* in each group, with the
remaining *TAB connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the TAB connector groups to be equivalent (D.13), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the BS-side *TAB
connectors* groups.

### 4.5.3 Transmission with multiple UE-side antenna connectors for RF repeater and NCR type 1-C

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each UE-side *antenna connector*
in the case of transmission with multiple UE-side *antenna connectors*.

Requirements are tested at the *antenna connector*, with the remaining
*antenna connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the antenna connectors to be equivalent (D.13), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the UE-side *antenna
connectors*.

### 4.5.3A Transmission with multiple UE-side antenna connectors for NCR type 1-H

The manufacturer shall declare a set of the input/output pairs and/or
groups to indicate the mapping between input-side and output-side TAB
connectors. The set of declared input/output pairs and/or groups should
include all TAB connectors.

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each UE-side *TAB connector* group
in the case of transmission with multiple UE-side *TAB connectors*
groups.

Requirements are tested at the *TAB connectors* in each group, with the
remaining *TAB connector(s)* being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the TAB connector groups to be equivalent (D.13), it is
sufficient to measure the signal at any one of the UE-side *TAB
connectors* groups.

### 4.5.4 Duplexers

The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer
fitted, if a duplexer is supplied as part of the repeater. If the
duplexer is supplied as an option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests
should be repeated with and without the duplexer fitted to verify that
the repeater meets the requirements of the present document in both
cases.

The following tests shall be performed with the duplexer fitted, and
without it fitted if this is an option:

1\) clause 6.2, repeater output power, for the highest static power step
only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;

2\) clause 6.4, out of band gain; outside the repeater downlink or
uplink band;

3\) clause 6.5, unwanted emissions; outside the repeater downlink or
uplink band;

4\) clause 6.8, output intermodulation; for the testing of conformance,
the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize intermodulation
products from the transmitters falling in receive channels.

5\) clause 6.9, Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio; outside the repeater
downlink or uplink band.

The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer
fitted.

NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is
important to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not
affect the test apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of
attenuators, isolators and filters.

NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be
generated, not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The
intermodulation products generated in the antenna system are not
controlled by 3GPP specifications, and may degrade during operation
(e.g. due to moisture ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued
satisfactory operation of a repeater, an operator will normally select
NR-ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive
channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator may specify
the NR-ARFCNs to be used.

### 4.5.5 Power supply options

If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.5.6 Ancillary RF amplifiers

The *repeater type 1-C* or *NCR type 1-C* requirements of the present
document shall be met with the ancillary RF amplifier fitted. At tests,
the ancillary amplifier is connected to the repeater by a connecting
network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable
loss to make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary
amplifier and the repeater. The applicable connecting network loss range
is declared by the manufacturer (D.14). Other characteristics and the
temperature dependence of the attenuation of the connecting network are
neglected. The actual attenuation value of the connecting network is
chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme values. The lowest
value is used unless otherwise stated.

Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted
and, if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify
that the repeater meets the requirements of the present document in both
cases.

When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where \"x\"
denotes that the test is applicable:

Table 4.5.6-1: Tests applicable to ancillary RF amplifiers

  Clause   Ancillary RF amplifier needed
  -------- -------------------------------
  6.2      x
  6.4      x
  6.5      x
  6.7      x
  6.8      x
  6.9      x

In repeater output power test (clause 6.2) highest applicable
attenuation value is applied.

### 4.5.7 Combining of repeaters

If the *repeater type 1-C* or *NCR type 1-C* is intended for combination
with additional apparatus connected to a repeater port and this
combination is supplied as a system, the combination of repeater
together with the additional apparatus shall also fulfil the repeater
requirements. E.g. if the repeater is intended for combination such that
multiple repeaters amplify the same signals into the same ports the
combination shall also fulfil the repeater requirements.

An example of such a configuration is shown in figure 4.5.7-1.

4.6 Manufacturer declarations
-----------------------------

The following repeater declarations listed in table 4.6-1, when
applicable to the repeater under test, are required to be provided by
the manufacturer for the conducted requirements testing of the *repeater
type 1-C*. Declarations can be made independently for UL and DL.

### 4.7.3 RTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation for RF repeater

The purpose of test configuration RTC1 is to test all repeater
requirements that need an input signal in the *passband* when there is
only one *passband* per *operating band*.

#### 4.7.3.1 RTC1 generation

RTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum *passband* Bandwidth supported shall be used;

\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower *passband* edge. If the width of the *passband* is
at least twice the bandwidth of the signal to be tested then place a
second signal adjacent to the upper *passband* edge. Otherwise
reposition the carrier to be tested according to the single carrier test
frequencies described in section 4.9.1.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis using the same *antenna connector*. All configured component
carriers are transmitted simultaneously in the tests where the repeater
should be ON.

#### 4.7.3.2 RTC1 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the expected input power to the
repeater for the test (i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB)
according to the manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.5 RTC2: Non-contiguous spectrum operation for RF repeater

The purpose of RTC2 is to test all repeater requirements that need an
input signal in the *passband* when there is more than one *passband*
per *operating band*.

\- The repeater *passband* bandwidths shall be the maximum *passband*
Bandwidth supported for multiple passbands (D.11). The repeater RF
Bandwidth consists of one sub-block gap and the two highest and lowest
declared *passbands*.

\- For each *passband*, select the carrier to be tested according to
4.7.2. If the the width of the *passband* is at least twice that of the
carrier to be tested then place a carrier adjacent to the upper
*passband* edge and another carrier (as described in 4.7.2) adjacent to
the lower *passband* edge. Otherwise, tests shall be applied with one
carrier adjacent to the lower sub-block edge and one carrier adjacent to
the upper sub-block edge for each sub-block gap.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

#### 4.7.5.2 RTC2 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the
test (i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

\- The repeater RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall be
the declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation
(D.12).

\- The number of carriers of each supported *operating band* shall be
sufficient to fill all of the *passbands* with one or two carriers
(depending on the passband bandwidth). Carriers shall be selected
according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the outermost edges of
the declared repeater Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be
placed at the repeater RF Bandwidths edges, if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to RTC1, where the
declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. The mirror
image of the single-band test configuration shall be used in each
alternate band(s) and in the highest band.

\- If the bandwidth of any *passband* is insufficient to accommodate two
carriers then tests shall be repeated with the test carriers positioned
such that there is a carrier adjacent to the lower edge of a sub-block
gap or inter-band gap and a carrier adjacent to the upper edge of the
sub-block gap or inter-band gap, for each sub-block gap or inter-block
gap.

#### 4.7.6.2 RTC3 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same level so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the test

the declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation
(D.12).

\- The allocated repeater RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall be selected according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth for outermost
bands and at the Repeater RF Bandwidths edges for middle band(s) if any.
Additional carriers shall next be placed at the Repeater RF Bandwidths
edges, if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to RTC3, where the
declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest
supported NR channel bandwidth and smallest subcarrier spacing shall be
used in the test configuration.

\- If only one carrier can be placed for the concerned band(s), the
carrier(s) shall be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum radio bandwidth for outermost band(s) and at one of the
outermost edges of the supported frequency range within the Base Station
RF Bandwidths for middle band(s) if any.

#### 4.7.7.2 RTC4 power allocation

method:

\- Declared maximum *passband* Bandwidth supported shall be used;

\- Place an NCR-MT carrier at the lower end of the passband. Generate an
NR carrier using test equipment at the upper edge of the passband, and a
second NR carrier adjacent to the NCR-MT carrier within the passband. If
there is insufficient space for the NR carriers then remove firstly the

### 4.8.4 Applicability of test configurations for *multi-band* operation

For a repeater declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the test
configuration in table 4.8.4-1 and/or table 4.8.2-1 shall be used for
testing. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on common
*multi-band connector*, the test configuration in the second column of
table 4.8.4-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped
on common *single-band connector*, the test configuration in table
4.8.2-1 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector*, the test
configuration in the third column of table 4.8.4-1 shall be used.

For a NCR declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the test
configuration in table 4.8.4-2 and/or table 4.8.2-2 shall be used for
testing. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on common
*multi-band connector*, the test configuration in the second column of
table 4.8.4-2 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped
on common *single-band connector*, the test configuration in table
4.8.2-2 shall be used. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector*, the test
configuration in the third column of table 4.8.4-2 shall be used.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single passband testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the repeater. These are denoted as RF
channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
passband at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum repeater RF
Bandwidth located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~
(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

For repeater capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated,
the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~: the *repeater RF Bandwidths* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and
at the highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
Maximum Radio Bandwidth, in the highest operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the *repeater RF Bandwidths* located at the top
of the supported frequency range in the highest operating band and at
the lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum
Radio Bandwidth, in the lowest operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands.
B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *repeater RF Bandwidths* are located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and
at the top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single passband, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation, the position of B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in
the supported operating band combinations shall be specified by the
laboratory. The laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer
or other bodies.

4.9A RF channels and test models for NCR
----------------------------------------

### 4.9A.1 RF channels

For the single passband or carrier testing many tests in this
specification are performed with appropriate frequencies in the bottom,
middle and top channels of the supported frequency range of the NCR.
These are denoted as RF channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
passband or carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum NCR RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range
in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~
(middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum NCR RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum NCR RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum NCR RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.

For NCR capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the
test shall be performed at B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~: the *NCR RF Bandwidths* located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and at the
highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum
Radio Bandwidth, in the highest operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the *NCR RF Bandwidths* located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the highest operating band and at the
lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum
Radio Bandwidth, in the lowest operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands.
B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *NCR RF Bandwidths* are located at the bottom
of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the
top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single passband or carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for
single band operation, the position of B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and
B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band combinations shall be
specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult with operators,
the manufacturer or other bodies.

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where a repeater or NCR operates can either be
contiguous or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements
in the present specification apply for repeater or NCR configured for
both contiguous spectrum operation and non-contiguous spectrum
operation.

For repeater or NCR operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some
requirements apply both at the repeater or NCR *passband* edges and
inside the sub-block gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how
the limits apply relative to the repeater or NCR *passband* edges and
the sub-block edges respectively.

4.11 Requirements for repeater capable of multi-band operation
--------------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band connector* the conducted test requirements in clause 6
apply separately to each supported *operating band* unless otherwise
stated. For some conducted test requirements, it is explicitly stated
that specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at
*multi-band connector(s)* as detailed in the requirement clause. For
repeater or NCR capable of multi-band operation, various structures in
terms of combinations of different transceivers in downlink and
transceivers in uplink implementations (multi-band or single band) with
mapping of transceivers to one or more *antenna* *connectors* for
*repeater* or *NCR type 1-C* or one or more TAB connectors for NCR type
1-H in different ways are possible. For *multi-band connector(s)* the
exclusions or provisions for multi-band apply. For *single-band
connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, output intermodulation, ACRR and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the repeater or NCR is configured for single-band operation,
*single-band requirements* shall apply to this connector configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable repeater or NCR are applicable. *Single-band requirements* are
tested separately at the connector configured for single-band operation,
with all other connectors terminated.

For *multi-band connectors* supporting the bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur between the bands.

NOTE 1: The conducted test requirements for multi-band connectors
supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present
release of this specification.

The output power limit for the respective repeater classes in tables
6.2.1-1, 6.2.1-2, 6.2.1-3 and 6.2.1-4 shall be compared to the rated
output power and the declared repeater class. It is not subject to
testing.

### 6.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *passband*.

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is defined for normal
and extreme conditions in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd* is defined for normal and extreme
conditions in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.2.3.1.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-MT* is defined for normal and extreme
conditions in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.2.3.2.

### 6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the repeater output power accuracy of
the *rated passband output power* across the frequency range and under
normal and extreme conditions is within the limit specified by the
minimum requirement in 6.2.2.

### 6.2.4 Method of test

#### *6.2.4.1 Initial conditions*

Test environment:

\- Normal, see annex B.2,

\- Extreme, see annexes B.3 and B.5.

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex x.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

RF channels positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1.

Under extreme test environment, it is sufficient to test on one NR-ARFCN
or one RF bandwidth position, and with one applicable test configuration
defined in clauses 4.7 and 4.8. Testing shall be performed under extreme
power supply conditions, as defined in annex B.5.

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.

Power levels for repeater type 1-C and NCR type 1-C to be tested:

\- The lowest input power (P~in,p,AC~) that produces the *rated passband
output power* (P~rated,p,AC~).

\- The lowest input power (P~in,p,AC~) that produces the *rated passband
output power* (P~rated,p,AC~), plus 10 dB.

Power levels for NCR type 1-H to be tested:

\- The lowest input power (P~in,p,TABC~) that produces the *rated
passband output power* (P~rated,p,TABC~).

\- The lowest input power (P~in,p,TABC~) that produces the *rated
passband output power* (P~rated,p,TABC~), plus 10 dB.

#### *6.2.4.2 Procedure*

1\) Connect the power measuring equipment to the output *single-band
connector(s)* or to *multi-band connector(s)* and the signal generator
equipment to the input *single-band connector(s)* or to *multi-band
connector(s)* under test as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors not
under test shall be terminated.

2\) For single carrier set the signal generator to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2 at power levels
to be tested, as in clause 6.2.4.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of
multi-carrieroperation set the connector under test to transmit on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) For RF repeater, measure the *maximum passband output power measured
per antenna connector* (P~max,p,AC~) for each carrier at each connector
under test.

For NCR-Fwd, measure the *maximum passband output power measured per
antenna connector* (P~max,p,AC~) for NCR type 1-C and per TAB connector
(P~max,p,TABC~) for NCR type 1-H for each carrier under test. For
NCR-MT, measure the output power per antenna connector (P~max,p,AC~) for
NCR type 1-C and per TAB connector (P~max,p,TABC~) for NCR-type 1-H for
each carrier under test.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

4\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

### 6.2.5 Test requirement

For RF repeater, for each *single-band connector* or *multi-band
connector* under test, the power measured in clause 6.2.4.2 in step 3
(P~max,p,AC~) shall remain within the values provided in table 6.2.5-1
for normal and extreme test environments, relative to the
manufacturer\'s declared P~rated,p,AC~ for *repeater type 1-C* (D.9):

### 6.4.4 Method of test

#### 6.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- Normal, see annex B.2,

#### 6.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Connect the CW generator to the input and power measuring equipment
to the output *single-band connector(s)* or to *multi-band connector(s)*
under test as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors not under test shall
be terminated.

2\) Set the CW generator to generate a test signal with an input power
equivalent to P~in,p,AC.~ for RF repeater type 1-C or NCR type 1-C and
P~in,p,TABC~ for NCR type 1-H.

3\) Measure the output for each carrier at each connector under test.
The out of band gain at the frequency under test is given by the
difference in dB between the measured output power and the power of the
input signal.

4\) Repeat steps 2-3, shifting the offset frequency of the CW from the
edge of the *passband* from 200kHz to 10MHz for bands below 2496MHz and
15MHz for other FR1 bands in steps of 200kHz for each *passband* and,
for the case of multi-band connectors each operating band.

### 6.4.5 Test Requirements

The gain outside the *passband* shall not exceed the maximum level
specified in table 6.4.5-1 or table 6.4.5-2 or table 6.4.5-3, where:

\- f\_offset\_CW is the offset between the outer channel edge frequency
of the outer channel in the *passband* and a CW signal.

6.5 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.5.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[4\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *channel
bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as
harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and
frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the Repeater transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* of *repeater type 1-C, NCR type 1-C* and *NCR type 1-H*
DL and uplink *operating band* of *repeater type 1-C, NCR type 1-C* and
*NCR type 1-H* UL, plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~
below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in tables 6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.5.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band of repeater type 1-C, NCR-Fwd type 1-C and NCR-Fwd type 1-H DL*

  **Repeater type or NCR**   ***Operating band* characteristics**          **Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)**
  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------- --------------------
  *NCR-Fwd type 1-H*         F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                             100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
  Repeater type 1-C          F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 200 MHz            10
  *and NCR-Fwd type 1-C*     200 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

Table 6.5.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink *operating band
of repeater 1-C, NCR-Fwd type 1-C and NCR-Fwd type 1-H UL*

  **Repeater type or NCR**   ***Operating band* characteristics**          **Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)**
  -------------------------- --------------------------------------------- --------------------
  *NCR-Fwd type 1-H*         F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                             100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
  Repeater type 1-C          F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 200 MHz            10
  *and NCR-Fwd type 1-C*     200 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

For *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied
per the *TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the configurations
supported by the NCR. The *basic limits* and corresponding emissions
scaling are defined in each relevant clause.

There is no co-location unwanted emission requirement for LA NCR-Fwd
type 1-C and repeaters type 1-C deployed in Femto cell scenario.

### 6.5.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *repeater type 1-C passband*
whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or
multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

For a *repeater* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.5.2.5 shall apply in *gaps between passbands*
for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.5-3 or 6.5.2.5-3a, while
the CACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.5 shall apply in *gaps between
passbands* for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.5.2.5-4 or
6.5.2.5-4a.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.5
shall apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.5.2.5-3 or 6.5.2.5-3a, while the CACLR requirement in clause
6.5.2.5 shall apply in *inter-passband gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.5.2.5-4 or 6.5.2.5-4a.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for RF repeater is in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.5.2.2.

The minimum requirement for NCR is in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.5.2.4.

#### 6.5.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement
shall be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.2.4 Method of test

test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.3. All connectors not
under test shall be terminated.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

> \- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.5.2.5.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.

2\) For RF repeater or NCR-Fwd, set the input signal to the
representative connectors under test according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.7 using the corresponding test models
RDL-FR1-TM1.1 and RUL-FR1-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power
intended to produce the maximum rated output power for RF repeater and
using the corresponding test models NCRDL-FR1-TM1.1 and NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1
in clause 4.9A.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum
rated output power for NCR :

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for RF repeater,

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for NCR type 1-C,

\- P~in,p,TABC~+10dB for NCR type 1-H.

For NCR-MT, set the NCR-MT transmitting with declared maximum output
power according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.7 using
the corresponding test models NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2.

NOTE: Step 2 applies to NCR if NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT are not transmitting
simultaneously. Otherwise, Step 2a applies:

2a) If NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT is transmitting simultaneously, set the input
signal to the representative connectors under test according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.7 using the corresponding test
models NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1for NCR-Fwd in clause 4.9.2 at the input power
intended to produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB
for NCR type 1-C and P~in,p,TABC~+10dB for NCR type 1-H and
NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1 for NCR-MT with declared maximum output power.

3\) Measure ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of the passband
edge or carrier edge as specified in clause 6.5.2.5. In multiple carrier
case only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest
carrier frequency used shall be measured.

4\) For the ACLR requirement applied inside *gap between passbands*, or
inside *Inter passband gap* for multi-band operation:

a\) Measure ACLR inside *gap between passbands* or *Inter passband gap*
as specified in clause 6.5.2.5, if applicable.

b\) Measure CACLR inside *gap between passbands* or *Inter passband gap*
as specified in clause 6.5.2.5, if applicable.

5\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to RDL-FR1-TM1.2
for DL and RUL-FR1-TM1.2 for UL in clause 4.9.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following step shall
apply:

6\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.5.2.5 Test requirements for RF repeater

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in table 6.5.2.5‑1 for
*repeater type 1-C* for DL and UL for Wide Area class.

For *repeater type 1-C* for DL and for UL for WA class, the ACLR (CACLR)

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a *gap
between passband* or the *inter-passband gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *gap
between passband* or the *inter-passband gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *repeater type 1-C passband edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table6.5.2.5-4 and 6.5.2.5-4a and the filters on the assigned channels
are defined in table 6.5.2.5-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for *repeater type 1-C* for DL and for UL for WA class for NR carriers
located on either side of the *gap between passband* or the
*inter-passband gap* shall be higher than the value specified in table
6.5.2.5-4.

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* or the ACLR (CACLR) *limits as
specified in clause 6.5.2.5*, whichever is less stringent, shall apply
for each *antenna connector*.

For simultaneous NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT transmission, if the NCR-MT carrier
is within the passband then the nominal channel bandwidth shall be
calculated based on the the bandwidth between the lower edge of the
passband and the lower edge of the NCR-MT carrier for lower side, or
between the upper edge of the passband and the upper edge of the NCR-MT
carrier for upper side. If the NCT-MT carrier is adjacent to the
passband then ACLR requirement for NCR-MT based on NCR-MT channel
bandwidth shall be applied for the NCR-MT carrier side and the nominal
channel bandwidth calculated with the passband bandwidth shall be used
for the passband side. If the NCR-MT carrier is not adjacent to the
passband then CACLR shall be applied in the gap between the passband and
the NCR-MT carrier.

##### 6.5.2.6.1.2 Test requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* {#test-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-h .H6}

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* + X (where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) for DL and for WA UL and X=0 for LA UL)
or the ACLR (CACLR) *limits as specified in clause 6.5.2.5*, whichever
is less stringent, shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group*. For joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in uplink, the
limits shall apply to the sum of emissions from both NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.

For simultaneous NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT transmission, if the NCR-MT carrier
is within the passband then the nominal channel bandwidth shall be
calculated based on the the bandwidth between the lower edge of the
passband and the lower edge of the NCR-MT carrier for lower side, or
between the upper edge of the passband and the upper edge of the NCR-MT
carrier for upper side. If the NCT-MT carrier is adjacent to the
passband then ACLR requirement for NCR-MT based on NCR-MT channel
bandwidth shall be applied for the NCR-MT carrier side and the nominal
channel bandwidth calculated with the passband bandwidth shall be used
for the passband side. If the NCR-MT carrier is not adjacent to the
passband then CACLR shall be applied in the gap between the passband and
the NCR-MT carrier.

NOTE: Conformance to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* ACLR requirement can be
demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The ratio of the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the assigned
channel frequency to the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent
channel frequency shall be greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic
limit* of the repeater. This shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min
cell group*.

Or

2\) The ratio of the filtered mean power at the *TAB connector* centred
on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power at this
*TAB connector* centred on the adjacent channel frequency shall be
greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic limit* of the repeater for
every *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each
*TAB connector TX min cell group*.

In case the ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of *repeater type 1-H*
are applied, the conformance can be demonstrated by meeting at least one
of the following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the filtered mean power measured on each *TAB connector*
in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent channel
frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR (CACLR) absolute
ba*sic limit* + X of the repeater. This shall apply to each *TAB*
connector *TX min cell group.*

Or

2\) The filtered mean power at each *TAB connector* centred on the
adjacent channel frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR
(CACLR) absolute *basic limit* + X of the repeater scaled by X
-10log~10~(*n*) for every *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min
cell group*, for each *TAB connector TX min cell group*, where *n* is
the number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group.*

For WA NCR-MT type 1-C, the WA BS ACLR test requirements specified in
clause 6.5.2.5 apply.

For LA NCR-MT type 1-C, if the measured adjacent channel power is
greater than --50 dBm then the NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value
specified in Table 6.5.2.6.2.1-2.

### 6.5.3 Operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for *repeater type 1-C* DL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑1
for the NR *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for *repeater type 1-C* UL are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1‑2 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for *repeater type 1-C* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *gap
between passband*. In addition, for a *repeater type 1-C* operating in
multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any *inter-passband*
*gap*.

*Limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *passband edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band of repeater type 1-C DL and uplink operating
band of repeater type 1-C UL*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in tables
6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any ***inter-passband** gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined minimum requirement shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the minimum requirement specified at the
*repeater type 1-C passband edges* on each side of the
***inter-passband** gap*.

\- ∆f is the separation between the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *repeater type 1-C passband edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation from the *repeater type 1-C passband
edge* frequency to the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *inter-passband gap* minus half of the
bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector of repeater type 1-C DL*, the operating band
unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are
carrier(s) transmitted in another supported downlink *operating band*.
In this case, no cumulative minimum requirement is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating band* with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission minimum requirement of the band
where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the
present clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirement of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined
in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset
(∆f~max~), shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up
to Δf~OBUE~ MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink
*operating band* without any carrier transmitted.

For a *multi-band connector of repeater type 1-C UL*, the operating band
unwanted emission limits apply also in a supported uplink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are
carrier(s) transmitted in another supported uplink *operating band*. In
this case, no cumulative minimum requirement is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported uplink *operating band* with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink *operating band* without
any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the inter-band gap between a supported uplink operating band
with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\* Δf~OBUE~, f\_offsetmax
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported uplink operating bands and the operating band
unwanted emission minimum requirement of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause,
shall apply across both uplink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirements of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as
defined in the tables of the present clause for the largest frequency
offset (∆fmax), shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest
frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz above the highest frequency of the
supported uplink operating band without any carrier transmitted.

In addition, inside any *gap between passband* for a *single-band
connector* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined minimum
requirement shall be applied which is the cumulative sum of the minimum
requirement specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the
*gap between passband*.

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *gap between passband* bandwidth minus
half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for RF repeater is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.5.3.2:

The minimum requirement for NCR is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.5.3.3.

#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.3.4.2 Procedure for RF repeater

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors
not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

Detection mode: True RMS.

For RF repeater and NCR, set the input signal to the representative
connectors under test according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models RDL-FR1-TM1.1 and
RUL-FR1-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce the
maximum rated output power for RF repeater and using the corresponding
test models NCRDL-FR1-TM1.1 and NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1 in clause 4.9A.2 at the
input power intended to produce the maximum rated output power for NCR.

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for RF repeater type 1-C;

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for NCR type 1-C,

\- P~in,p,TABC~+10dB for NCR type 1-H.

For NCR-MT, set the NCR-MT transmitting with declared maximum output
power according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.7 using
the corresponding test models NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2.

NOTE: Step 2 applies to NCR if NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT are not transmitting
simultaneously. Otherwise, Step 2a applies:

2a) If NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT is transmitting simultaneously, set the input
signal to the representative connectors under test according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.7 using the corresponding test
models NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1for NCR-Fwd in clause 4.9.2 at the input power
intended to produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB
for NCR type 1-C and P~in,p,TABC~+10dB for NCR type 1-H and
NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1 for NCR-MT with declared maximum output power.

3\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For connector under test
declared to operate in multiple bands or non-contiguous spectrum, the
emission within the *Inter passband Bandwidth* or *sub-block gap* shall
be measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest
RF Bandwidth or sub block edge.

4\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases, with the channel
set-up according to NR-FR1-TM 1.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following step shall
apply:

5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
emissions at the *antenna connector* and the deployment (including
antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides
the characteristics of the repeater needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be
determined using the method outlined in TS 36.104 \[6\], annex E.

### 6.5.4 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding

> \- the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of
> each supported downlink *operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
> highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, where
> the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1 for downlink, or
>
> \- the frequency range from ΔfOBUE below the lowest frequency of each
> supported uplink operating band, up to ΔfOBUE above the highest
> frequency of each supported uplink operating band, where the ΔfOBUE is
> defined in table 6.5.1-2 for uplink.

For some *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating
band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[4\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *Repeater type 1-C* *and NCR
type 1-C or* over all *TAB connectors* for *NCR type 1-C* shall not
exceed the *minimum requirements* defined in clause 6.5.4.5.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for RF repeater is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.5.4.2.

The minimum requirement for NCR is defined in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.5.4.4.

#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure for RF repeater

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors
not under test shall be terminated.

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.5.4.5.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

3\) For RF repeater and NCR, set the input signal to the representative
connectors under test according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models RDL-FR1-TM1.1 and
RUL-FR1-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce the
maximum rated output power, P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for for RF repeater and
using the corresponding test models NCRDL-FR1-TM1.1 and NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1
in clause 4.9A.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum
rated output power for NCR.

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for RF repeater type 1-C;

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for NCR type 1-C,

\- P~in,p,TABC~+10dB for NCR type 1-H.

For NCR-MT, set the NCR-MT transmitting with declared maximum output
power according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.7 using
the corresponding test models NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2.

NOTE: Step 2 applies to NCR if NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT are not transmitting
simultaneously. Otherwise, Step 4a applies:

3a) If NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT is transmitting simultaneously, set the input
signal to the representative connectors under test according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.7 using the corresponding test
models NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1for NCR-Fwd in clause 4.9.2 at the input power
intended to produce the maximum rated output power, Pin,p,AC + 10dB for
NCR type 1-C and Pin,p,TABC+10dB for NCR type 1-H and NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1
for NCR-MT with declared maximum output power.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.5.4.5.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the repeater-Node, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR *operating band*. It is
in some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement
is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies,
since this is set by local or regional regulation.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *minimum requirements* are provided in table
6.5.4.5.2-1 where requirements for co-existence with the system listed
in the first column apply for *repeater type 1-C, NCR type 1-C and NCR
type 1-H*. For a *multi-band connector*, the exclusions and conditions
in the Note column of table 6.5.4.5.2-1 apply for each supported
*operating band*.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink
*operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest repeater transmitter
frequency of the downlink *operating band*. Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
clause 6.5.1.

The spurious emission *minimum requirements* for this requirement are:

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to NR repeater
or NCR operating in Band n50 and n75 within the 1432 -- 1452 MHz, and in
Band n51 and Band n76. The *minimum requirements are* specified in Table
6.5.4.5.2-3. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range
from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of the repeater downlink
*operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the
repeater downlink *operating band*.

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[14\], is defined in terms
of EIRP, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the
*antenna connector* and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex F.

Note: The regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC
reference document, 0007135419 are defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna
gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP~ =
P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the repeater unwanted emission level at
the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals the repeater antenna gain minus
feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement.

##### 6.5.4.5.3 Co-location with base stations and *repeater* 

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS,
IAB-DU, IAB-MT and *repeater* receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900,
GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT, or
*repeater* are co-located with *repeater*.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with same class.

The *minimum requirements* are in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 for a *repeater*.
Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column
apply, depending on the declared *repeater* class. For a *multi-band
connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.5.4.5.3-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit
frequency range of a *repeater type 1-C*. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[15\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.5.4.5.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a
case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

#### 6.5.4.6 Test requirements for *NCR*

##### 6.5.4.6.1 Test requirement for NCR-Fwd

##### 6.5.4.6.1.1 Test requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-C {#test-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-c-1 .H6}

The Tx spurious emissions for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* for each *antenna
connector* shall not exceed the *basic limits* specified in clause
6.5.4.5.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of the spurious
emissions over all *antenna connectors* for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* shall not
exceed the *basic limits* defined in clause 6.5.4.5.

*For joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the
spurious emissions limits shall apply to the total emissions from both
the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.*

##### 6.5.4.6.1.2 Test requirement for NCR-Fwd type 1-H {#test-requirement-for-ncr-fwd-type-1-h-2 .H6}

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* are that
for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic
limit* in clause 6.5.4.5, the power summation emissions at the *TAB
connectors* of the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell
group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) for DL and for WA UL and X=0
for LA UL, unless stated differently in regional regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* spurious emission
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause
for the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is
the number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

*For joint transmission of NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT in the uplink, the
spurious emissions limits shall apply to the total emissions from both
the NCR-Fwd and NCR-MT.*

##### 6.5.4.6.2 Test requirement for NCR-MT

##### 6.5.4.6.2.1 Test requirements for NCR-MT type 1-C {#test-requirements-for-ncr-mt-type-1-c-2 .H6}

When NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmitting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.5.4.5 applies for WA NCR-MT type 1-C and the
requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 \[9\] applies for LA NCR-MT
type 1-C.

When NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the requirements
in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 \[9\] applies for LA NCR-MT type 1-C for
sum of NCR-MT transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.

##### 6.5.4.6.2.2 Test requirements for NCR-MT type 1-H {#test-requirements-for-ncr-mt-type-1-h-2 .H6}

Limits for NCR-MT type 1-H apply to the sum of emissions across all TAB
connectors.

When WA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.5.4.5 relaxed with the following scaling factor
applies for WA NCR-MT type 1-H.

10log(*N~TXU,counted~*), where N~TXU,counted~ = min(N~TXU,active~ ,8)

When WA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.5.4.5 relaxed with the following scaling factor
applies for the sum of NCR-MT transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.

When LA NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are not transmting simultaneously, the
requirements in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 \[9\] applies for LA NCR-MT
type 1-H without scaling factor allowed for the sum of the spurious
emissions.

When NCR-MT and NCR-Fwd are transmting simultaneously, the requirements
in clause 6.5.3 in TS 38.101-1 \[9\] applies for sum of NCR-MT
transmission and NCR-Fwd transmission.

### 6.5.5 Receiver spurious emissions

#### 6.5.5.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *antenna
connector*. The requirements only apply to *repeater type 1-C, NCR type
1-C* and *NCR type 1-H* for TDD operation.

For each a*ntenna connectors or TAB connectors* on BS-side and UE-side
supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements apply during the
*transmitter OFF state*. For *antenna connectors or TAB connectors* on
both BS-side and UE-side in FDD, the RX spurious emissions requirements
are superseded by the TX spurious emissions requirements, as specified
in clause 6.5.4.5.

For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF state*, and are subject to exclusion zones
in each supported *operating band*.

For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of receiver spurious
emissions requirements over all *antenna connectors* for *repeater type
1-C, NCR type 1-C* and *NCR type 1-H* shall not exceed *minimum
requirements* defined in clause 6.5.5.5.

#### 6.5.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for RF repeater are in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clause 6.5.5.2.

The minimum requirements for NCR are in TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.5.5.4.

#### 6.5.5.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater or NCR to
limit the interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other
systems.

#### 6.5.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test,

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.9.

2\) Ensure the transmitter is OFF.

3\) Set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in table
6.5.5.5-1.

4\) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described
in table 6.5.5.5-1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.5.5.5 Test requirements

The receiver spurious emissions requirements for *repeater type 1-C* are
that for each *antenna connector,* the power of emissions shall not
exceed the value specified in table 6.5.5.5-1.

6.6 Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
-----------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.1.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of repeater and the measured
signal symbols at the output of the repeater after the equalization by
the measurement equipment. This difference is called the error vector.
Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as
specified in TS 38.104 \[5\] Annex B for FR1. The repeater EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed in percent. The accuracy of the
input symbols is counted in the measurement uncertainty.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.1.1-1.

Table 6.6.1.1-1: Minimum input power for repeater EVM

### 6.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference
between the reference waveform provided at the input of the repeater and
the measured waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is
called the error vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is
determined are the same as specified in TS 38.101-1\[9\] Annex F. Before
calculating the repeater EVM the measured waveform is corrected by the
sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage
shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the
repeater EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the repeater EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement
specified in TS 38.101-1\[9\] clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms,
the repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as
the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean
reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the repeater
EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square root of the
ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed as a %. The accuracy of the input waveform is counted in the
measurement uncertainty.

The basic repeater EVM measurement interval in one slot in the time
domain. The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols
that contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval,
as defined in TS 38.101-1 \[9\] clause 6.3.3 for EVM for UE.

The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at
an input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum
output power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.2.1-1.

6.7 Input intermodulation
-------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

#### 6.7.1.1 General

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the passband, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the passband.

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
Repeater to maintain the wanted frequency free of internally created
interference.

The measurements shall apply to both uplink and downlink paths of the
Repeater, during the *transmitter ON state* at maximum gain.

#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is in TS 38.106 \[2\],
clauses 6.7.1.2, 6.7.2.2 and 6.7.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clauses 6.7.1.3.1.1, 6.7.2.3.1.1, and 6.7.3.3.1.1.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clauses 6.7.1.3.1.2, 6.7.2.3.1.2, and 6.7.3.3.1.2.

#### 6.7.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified by the minimum
requirements.

#### 6.7.1.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A.2

A measurement system set-up is shown in Annex D.

1\) Set the RF repeater or NCR to maximum gain.

2\) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.

3\) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the RF repeater or NCR.

##### 6.7.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the
passband, so that one carrier, f~1~, is 1 MHz outside the channel edge
frequency of the first or last channel in the passband, and the lowest
order intermodulation product from the two carriers is positioned in the
centre of the passband.

2\) Measure the increase in output power in the passband when the
interferer is applied.

3\) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the RF repeater or
NCR.

#### 6.7.1.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.1.5.1 General requirement

The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals
are applied to the RF repeater or NCR:

Table 6.7.1.5.1-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  1,0 MHz       -40 dBm                     2 CW carriers     1 MHz

f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first
or last channel in the passband of the closer carrier.

For the parameters specified in Table 6.7.1.5.1-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase by more than \[10+TT\] dB at the output of the
Repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

##### 6.7.1.5.2 Co-location with BS/Repeater in other systems 

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or
repeater operating in a different frequency band are co-located with a
repeater.

The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on
the repeaters *passband*.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater. If
the BS side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the downlink. If
the UE side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should
meet input intermodulation co-location requirements for the uplink.

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and
6.7.1.5.2-2 do not apply when the Repeaters passband frequency range is
adjacent to the frequency range of the co-location requirement in the
Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 or Table 6.7.1.5.2-2. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[15\].

NOTE 2: The Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and Table 6.7.1.5.2-2 assumes that two
operating bands, where the corresponding BS or Repeater transmit and
receive frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

For the parameters specified in table Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and 6.7.1.5.2-2,
the power in the passband shall not increase with more than \[10 + TT\]
dB at the output of the repeater as measured in the centre of the
passband, compared to the level obtained without interfering signals
applied.

##### 6.7.1.5.3 Co-existence with other systems

This input intermodulation existence requirement may be applied for the
protection of repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or
repeater operating in another frequency band co-exist with a repeater.

The intermodulation performance should be met when the signals in Table
6.7.1.5.3-1 are applied to the Repeater:

NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 6.7.1.5.3-1 do not apply
when the repeaters passband frequency range is adjacent to the frequency
range of the co-existence requirement in the Table 6.7.1.5.3-1. The
current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-existence.

NOTE 2: The Table 6.7.1.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where
the frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

For the parameters specified in Table 6.7.1.5.3-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase with more than \[10 + TT\] dB at the output of
the repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

6.8 Output intermodulation
--------------------------

### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability

#### 6.8.1.1 General

The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the repeater to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering
signal reaching the repeater via the output port. The requirement shall
apply during the *transmitter ON state* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater.

The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an interfering signal is injected into the *antenna
connector* *or TAB connector*.

#### 6.8.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\] clause 6.8.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clause 6.8.3.1.1.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clause 6.8.3.1.3.

#### 6.8.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject
signal on the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal
applied at the repeater output port.

Test environment: normal; see Annex A.2

A measurement system set-up is shown in Annex D.

1\) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater (wanted
signal). Connect a signal generator to the output port (interfering
signal) and make sure the signal generator power is directed to the
repeater output port.

> 2\) Detection mode: True RMS.

##### 6.8.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the RF repeater or NCR to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (wanted signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model R-FR1-TM1.1 for RF
repeater and NCR-FR1-TM1.1 for NCR, with a bandwidth as defined in Table
6.8.1.5.1-1, at the level which produce the manufacturer specified
maximum output power at maximum gain.

3\) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference
signal) to generate a signal in accordance to test model R-FR1-TM1.1 for
RF repeater and NCR-FR1-TM1.1 for NCR, with a bandwidth, level and
frequency offset as defined in Table 6.8.1.5.1-1.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth as described in the test requirements and note
that the measured value does not exceed the specified value.
Measurements in the band of the interfering signal shall be excluded.
The measurements can be limited to the power of all third and fifth
order intermodulation products.

5\) Repeat the test from step 3 on until all interfering signal centre
frequency offsets in Table 6.8.1.5.1-1 has been tested, but exclude
interfering signal frequencies that are outside of the allocated
frequency band for NR downlink.

6\) For repeater supporting Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, repeat
the test using wanted and interfering signal parameters as defined in
Table 6.8.1.5.2-1.

NOTE: As a general rule the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

6.9 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
-------------------------------------------

### 6.9.1 Definitions and applicability

Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average gain
over a carrier of the repeater in the *passband* to the average gain of
the repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater *passband*.
The carrier in the *passband* and in the adjacent channel shall be of
the same type (reference carrier) with bandwidths as defined by *nominal
channel bandwidth*. In case of Local Area repeater above 2496 MHz, the
channel within the *passband* and the adjacent channel are assumed to
have a bandwidth of 10 MHz

The requirement is differentiated between uplink and downlink.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON state*.

### 6.9.2 Co-existence with UTRA, E-UTRA and NR

This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA, E-UTRA and
NR signals in geographic areas in which NR Repeater, NR BS, E-UTRA BS
and UTRA BS are deployed so that they serve adjacent channels. The
reference carrier is a NR carrier.

#### 6.9.2.1 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\] sub-clause 6.9.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clause 6.9.3.1.1.

6.10 Transmit ON/OFF power
--------------------------

### 6.10.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.10.1.1 Definition and applicability

Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the
repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of the
repeater.

Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the *passband
bandwidth* of the repeater (BW~passband~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF state*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz of the input signal.

For *multi-band connectors* and for *single band connectors* supporting
transmission in multiple *operating bands*, the requirement is only
applicable during the *transmitter OFF state* in all supported
*operating bands*.

#### 6.10.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.10.1.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clause 6.10.1.3.1.1.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clause 6.10.1.3.1.2.

#### 6.10.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter OFF power is
within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.10.1.4 Method of test

Requirement is tested together with transmitter transient period, as
described in clause 6.10.2.4.

#### 6.10.1.5 Test requirements

The conformance testing of transmit OFF power is included in the
conformance testing of transmitter transient period; therefore, see
clause 6.10.2.5 for test requirements.

### 6.10.2 Transmitter transient period

#### 6.10.2.1 Definition and applicability

*Transmitter transient period* requirements apply only to TDD operation
of the repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of
the repeater.

The *transmitter transient state* is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the *transmitter OFF state* to the
*transmitter ON period* or vice versa. The *transmitter transient
period* is illustrated in figure 6.10.2.1-1.

Figure 6.10.2.1-1: Example of relations between transmitter *ON state*,
transmitter *OFF state* and *transmitter transient period*

For *repeater type 1-C* or *NCR-type 1-C* this requirement shall be
applied at the *antenna connector* supporting transmission in the
*operating ban*d.

For *NCR-type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at the *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating ban*d.

For a repeater that is not declared to be a long delay repeater (D.15),
the beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced
to the slot timing at the input.

For a repeater that is declared to be a long delay repeater (D.15), the
beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced to
the slot timing at the input plus the declared repeater delay.

#### 6.10.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *repeater type 1-C* is defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\], clause 6.10.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-C* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clause 6.10.2.3.1.1.

The minimum requirement for *NCR-Fwd type 1-H* is defined in TS 38.106
\[2\], clause 6.10.2.3.1.2.

#### 6.10.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter transient periods
are within the limits of the minimum requirements.

#### 6.10.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.10.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.10.2.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *antenna connectors or TAB
connectors*, they may be tested one at a time or multiple *antenna
connectors or TAB connectors* may be tested in parallel as shown in
annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until
all *antenna connectors or TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *antenna connector or TAB connector* for input and output
signals to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All *antenna
connectors or TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

2\) For RF repeater and NCR, set the input signal to the representative
connectors under test according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models in clause 4.9.2 at the
input power intended to produce the maximum rated output power.

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for RF repeater type 1-C;

\- P~in,p,AC~ + 10dB for NCR type 1-C,

\- P~in,p,TABC~+10dB for NCR type 1-H.

Set the input signal to the representative connectors under test
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to
produce the maximum rated output power, P~rated,in,\ AC~ + 10dB.

3\) Measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the *antenna
connector or TAB connector* centred on the central frequency of the RF
bandwidth. 70/N μs average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end
of one transmitter ON state+ 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next
transmitter ON state -- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier
Spacing in kHz.

In addition, for *multi-band connector(s)*, the following steps shall
apply:

4\) For *multi-band connectors* *or TAB connectors* and single band
tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other band.

6.10.2.5 Test requirements

power spectral density shall be less than -82.5 dBm/MHz per *antenna
connector* for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \< f ≤ 6.0 GHz.

For *NCR-Fwd type 1-H uplink*, the requirements for transmitter OFF
power spectral density shall be less than -48dBm /
(SCS\*(12\*N~RB~+1)/1000) MHz per *antenna connector,* where SCS is Sub
Carrier Spacing in kHz for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz.

off, or

\- NCRUL-FR1-TM3.1a at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if
256QAM is supported by NCR-MT with power back off, and NCRUL-FR1-TM3.1
at maximum power, or

\- NCRUL-MT-FR1-TM3.1 with highest modulation order supported by NR-MT.

For a antenna connector or *TAB connector* declared to be capable of
multi-carrier operation (D.22), set the antenna connector or *TAB
connector* under test to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7
and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on all carriers configured:

\- NCRUL-FR1-TM3.1a if 256QAM is supported by NCR-MT without power back
off, or

\- NCRUL-FR1-TM3.1a at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if
256QAM is supported by NCR-MT with power back off, and NCRUL-FR1-TM3.1
at maximum power, or

\- NCRUL-FR1-TM3.1 with highest modulation order supported by NCR-MT.

For NCRUL-FR1-TM3.1a, power back-off shall be applied if it is declared.

2\) Measure the EVM and frequency error as defined in annex H.

3\) Repeat steps 1 and 2 for NCRUL-FR1-TM2 if 256QAM is not supported by
NCR-MT or for NCRUL-FR1-TM2a if 256QAM is supported by NCR-MT. For
NCRUL-FR1-TM2 and NCRUL-FR1-TM2a the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) shall
be at the lower limit of the dynamic range according to the test
procedure in clause 6.3.3.4 and test requirements in clause 6.3.3.5.

In addition, for *multi-band connector(s)*, the following steps shall
apply:

4\) For *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 6.12.5 Test requirements

The EVM of each NR carrier for different modulation schemes on PUSCH
shall be less than the limits in table 6.12.5-1.

Table 6.12.5-1: EVM requirements for *NCR-MT type 1-H*

  **Modulation scheme for PDSCH or PUSCH**   **Required EVM (%)**
  ------------------------------------------ ----------------------
  QPSK                                       18.5 %
  16QAM                                      13.5 %
  64QAM                                      9 %
  256QAM                                     4.5 %

EVM shall be evaluated for each NR carrier over all allocated resource
blocks and uplink slots for NCR-MT. Different modulation schemes listed
in table 6.12.5-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

For all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for each NR
carrier over all allocated resource blocks uplink slots for NCR-MT
within 10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM measurement
periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

Table 6.12.5-2, 6.12.5-3, 6.12.5-4 below specify the EVM window length
(*W*) for normal CP for *NCR type 1-H*.

6.13 Transmit intermodulation for NCR-MT
----------------------------------------

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non
linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

### 6.13.1 Definition and applicability

NCR-MT transmit intermodulation is defined by the ratio of the mean
power of the wanted signal to the mean power of the intermodulation
product when an interfering signal is added at a level below the wanted
signal at each transmitter antenna port with the other antenna port(s)
if any terminated.

### 6.13.2 Minimum requirement for NCR-MT

The Tx IMD requirements for IAB-MT specified in clause 6.7 of Rel-16 TS
38.174 \[26\] apply for WA and LA NCR-MT. **The IM interference level is
based on NCR-Fwd link.**

### 6.13.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *single-band connectors* or *multi-band connector*
under test to restrict the generation of intermodulation products in its
nonlinear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna to below
specified levels.

### 6.13.4 Method of test

#### 6.13.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Passband* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

#### 6.13.4.2 Procedure

For *NCR-MT type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.2. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.2 for *NCR-MT*. All
connectors not under test shall be terminated.

2\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.22), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* P~rated,c,AC~ for *NCR type 1-C* (D.21) and
P~rated,c,TABC~ for *NCR type 1-H* (D.21). Channel set-up shall be
according to NCRUL-FR1-TM 1.1 for NCR-MT.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation (D.22) set the connector under test to transmit on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2
for NCR-MT.

4\) For NCR-MT, generate the interfering signal according to
NCRUL-FR1-TM1.1, as defined in clause 4.9.2, with the minimum channel
bandwidth (BW~Channel~) with 15 kHz SCS of the band defined in
clause 5.3.5 and a centre frequency offset from the lower/upper edge of
the wanted signal or edge of sub-block inside a sub-block gap
![](./media/image40.wmf){width="1.4236111111111112in"
height="0.4236111111111111in"}, for n = 1, 2 and 3, but exclude
interfering frequencies that are outside of the allocated downlink
operating band or interfering frequencies that are not completely within
the sub-block gap or within the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

5\) Adjust ATT attenuator (as in the test setup in annex D.1.2 for
*NCR-MT*) so that level of the interfering signal is as defined in
clause 6.7.5.

6\) Perform the unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.6.3 and
6.6.4 for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which
appear in the frequency ranges defined in clauses 6.6.3 and 6.6.4. The
width of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

7\) Perform the transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in
clause 6.6.5, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products
which appear in the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.5. The width
of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

8\) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level in
clause 6.7.5 with the exception of interfering signal frequencies.

9\) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre
frequency offsets according to step 4.

10\) Repeat the test for the remaining test signals defined in
clause 6.7.5 for additional requirements and for *NCR type 1-H*
intra-system requirements.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

11\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2 and
2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1±2F2,
3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal centre
frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents the
interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are:

\- (n\*BW~F1~ + m\* BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;

\- (n\* BW~F2~ + m\* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;

Where BW~F1~ represents the test wanted signal RF bandwidth or channel
bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth and BW~F2~
represents the interfering signal channel bandwidth.

### 6.13.5 Test requirements

#### 6.13.5.1 Co-location minimum requirements

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 6.13.2 in the presence of an NR interfering
signal according to table 6.13.5.1-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Passband edges*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Passband* or
*Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the *sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to the
*Passband* *edges* of each operating band. In case the inter RF
Bandwidth gap is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ MHz (where BW~Channel~ is the
minimal *passband* of the band), the requirement in the gap shall apply
only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls
completely within the inter RF Bandwidth gap.

6.15 Maximum input level for NCR-MT
-----------------------------------

### 6.15.1 Definition and applicability

Maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the
Local Area *NCR-MT type 1-C* antenna port or *NCR-MT type 1-H* TAB
connectors, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet or
exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference measurement
channel.

### 6.15.2 Minimum requirement

For Local Area NCR-MT, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
38.101-1 \[9\] Annex A.3.2 and Annex A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with
parameters specified in TS 38.101-1 \[9\] in Table 7.4-1.

### 6.15.3 Test purpose

Maximum input level tests the NCR-MT ability to receive data with a
given average throughput for a specified reference measurement channel,
under conditions of high signal level, ideal propagation and no added
noise.

### 6.15.4 Method of test

Test description for NCR-MT conducted maximum input level is s specified
in TS 38.521-1 \[25\] clause 7.4.4.

#### 6.15.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 6.15.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For NCR-MT *type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB
connectors* necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment.

2\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in Table 6.15.5-1 in clause 6.15.5.

3\) Measure the throughput.

### 6.15.5 Test requirements

The throughput measurement derived in test procedure shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annex A.3.2 and A.3.3 with parameters specified in Tables
6.15.5-1.

#### 6.20.5.2 Test requirement for NCR-MT

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *NCR type 1-H* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 6.20.5.1-1 for each
*TAB connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at
respective *TAB connectors* shall not exceed the NCR-MT limits specified
as the *basic limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,counted~), unless
stated differently in regional regulation.

N~RXU,counted~ = min(N~RXU,active~ , 8 )

NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units .

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the NCR-MT.*

NOTE: Conformance to the NCR-MT receiver spurious emissions requirement
can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the NCR-MT limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the NCR-MT limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

7 Conducted performance requirements

7.1 NCR-MT Performance requirements

7.1.1 General

7.1.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the NCR-MT to
correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.
Conducted performance requirements are specified at the antenna
connectors (NCR-MT type 1-C) or TAB connector(s) (NCR type 1-H).

Conducted performance requirements for the NCR-MT are specified for the
fixed reference channels and the propagation conditions defined in
TS 38.106 \[2\] annex F and annex G, respectively.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

> S is the total signal energy in a slot on a single *antenna connector*
> or *TAB connector*.
>
> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a slot.

7.1.2 Demodulation performance requirements

7.1.2.1 General

7.1.2.2 Performance requirements for PDSCH

7.1.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by two means; a
minimum required throughput for a given SNR and a minimum SNR at which
1% BLER for the first transmission is achieved. The required throughput
is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
annex F. The throughput performance requirements assume HARQ
re-transmissions, whereas the first transmission BLER requirements do
not consider HARQ.

7.1.2.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\] clause 8.3.1.

7.1.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver's ability to achieve throughput and
1^st^ transmission BLER under multipath fading propagation conditions
for a given SNR.

7.1.2.2.4 Method of test

7.1.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

7.1.2.2.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Connect the NCR tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to all NCR-MT *TAB connectors*
> or *antenna connectors* for diversity reception via a combining
> network as shown in annex D.9 or D.11.
>
> 2\) Adjust the AWGN generator and adjust the AWGN power level to -77.2
> dBm / 38.16MHz.
>
> 3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding DL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex F and the test parameters in table 7.1.2.2.4.2-1.

#### 7.1.3.2 Reporting Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)

##### 7.1.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
frequency non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting
variance and the BLER performance using the transport format indicated
by the reported CQI median. The purpose is to verify that the reported
CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214
\[23\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the reporting
definition is considered to be verified if the reporting accuracy is met
for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an offset of 1 dB.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to NCR-MT is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 7.1.3.1.1.

##### 7.1.3.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 \[2\] clause 8.2.3.

##### 7.1.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to report CQI values
accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214 \[23\].

##### 7.1.3.2.4 Method of test

##### 7.1.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-21 .H6}

######## Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the repeater

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the repeater is to be tested are defined.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table B.1.

Table B.1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment

  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[16\];

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[17\];

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[18\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.1 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[19\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[20\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[21\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[19\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[20\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[19\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[20\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the repeater test environments defined in
annex B shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex E (normative): In-channel TX tests

E.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the repeater under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

E.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the repeater under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal
signal, that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an
ideal error free received signal. All signals are represented as
equivalent (generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a FDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 30 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz
(*N*~RB~ = 273). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

E.2.1 Output signal of the repeater under test
----------------------------------------------

The output signal of the repeater under test is acquired by the
measuring equipment and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at
a sampling rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and
it is named ![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png). The *FFT
size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table 6.6.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS in \[6\]. In the time domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is
modelled as a signal with the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.6.3.5-3 in \[6\]. The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of
the *FFT size* and SCS.

E.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal ![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex E.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal ![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png)
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols
are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex E.2.1 in the time domain.

E.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency stability

\- EVM

E.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1 in figure F.2.4-1.
The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT size* + cyclic prefix
length) samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\" box.
The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from table
6.6.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table
6.6.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS in \[6\].

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.6.3.5-2, 6.6.3.5-3 and
6.6.3.5-4 in \[6\]. Table F.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol
number and the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for
those two symbols according to the sampling rate.

Table E.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP
length for normal CP

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SCS (kHz)   \# slots in subframe   Symbol \# and slot \# with longer CP   Longer CP length
  ----------- ---------------------- -------------------------------------- ------------------------------
  15          1                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 128
                                     (symbol 7, slot 0)                     

  30          2                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 64
                                     (symbol 0, slot 1)                     

  60          4                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 32
                                     (symbol 0, slot 2)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic
prefix than the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length =
352).

E.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in
![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png) are varied in order to
minimise the difference between
![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png) and
![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png), after the amplitude
ratio of ![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png) and
![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png) has been scaled. Best
fit (minimum difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value
between ![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png) and
![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png) is an absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency stability.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency stability can
be derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples inbetween the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinuish between both.

After this process, the samples
![](./media/image50.png)![](./media/image50.png) are called
![](./media/image54.png)![](./media/image54.png).

E.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD,
there are ![](./media/image55.png)![](./media/image55.png) FFTs
performed where ![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of
symbols in a slot for normal CP is 14.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples
per OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the
acquired number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called
![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png),

\- ![](./media/image58.png)![](./media/image58.png), and

\- ![](./media/image59.png)![](./media/image59.png).

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from tables 6.6.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.6.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS in
\[6\]and the transmission bandwidth.

The repeater shall transmit a signal according to the test models
intended for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal
signal shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as
follows, using ![](./media/image54.png)![](./media/image54.png) and
![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png):

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal
![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png), the timing is known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal ![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png) is
a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the ideal signal
![](./media/image52.png)![](./media/image52.png) and the data in the
measured signal is 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of
more than one highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the
measured signal.

The number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to
![](./media/image54.png)![](./media/image54.png). This subset of samples
is called ![](./media/image60.png)![](./media/image60.png).

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre
![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png) is determined according
to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal CP, there
are two values for ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png) in a
1 ms period:

\- ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png) = length of cylic
prefix / 2,

\- ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png) = Longer CP length -
length of cylic prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.6.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.6.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.6.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS in \[6\], and the longer CP length is obtained from table
F.2.4-1.

As per the example values:

\- ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png) = 144 within the CP
of length 288 for OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,

\- ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png) = 208= 352 - 144)
within the CP of length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.

E.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on ![](./media/image61.png)![](./media/image61.png) with the
FFT window timing ![](./media/image57.png)![](./media/image57.png). The
result is called ![](./media/image62.png)![](./media/image62.png). The
RE TX power (RETP) is then defined as:

![](./media/image63.png)

Where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

![](./media/image64.png)

Where the summation accumulates
![](./media/image65.png)![](./media/image65.png) RETP values of all
*N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PDSCH and not containing PDCCH, RS or
SSB within a slot.

From the acquired samples,
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) values for each OSTP
can be obtained and averaged where
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) is the number of slots
in a 10 ms measurement interval for FDD. For TDD,
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) is the number of slots
with downlink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval and is computed
according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1 in \[6\].

For the example used in the annex,
![](./media/image66.png)![](./media/image66.png) and
![](./media/image67.png)![](./media/image67.png).

E.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform![](./media/image55.png)![](./media/image55.png) FFTs on
![](./media/image61.png)![](./media/image61.png), one for each OFDM
symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing to
produce an array of samples,
![](./media/image55.png)![](./media/image55.png) in the time axis *t* by
*FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 280 FFTs are performed on
![](./media/image61.png)![](./media/image61.png). The result is an array
of samples, 280 in the time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image68.png)![](./media/image68.png) and
![](./media/image69.png)![](./media/image69.png)are determined as
follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image70.png)![](./media/image70.png)and the
post-FFT ideal signal ![](./media/image71.png)![](./media/image71.png)
for each demodulation reference signal, over 10 ms measurement interval.
This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image72.png)

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image73.png)![](./media/image73.png) an unwrap operation
must be performed according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
![](./media/image73.png)![](./media/image73.png) by adding multiples of
2 \* π when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances
![](./media/image74.png)![](./media/image74.png) are greater than or
equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

![](./media/image75.png)

![](./media/image76.png)

> Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signals time-domain
> locations ![](./media/image74.png)![](./media/image74.png) from
> ![](./media/image62.png)![](./media/image62.png) for each demodulation
> reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image77.png)![](./media/image77.png) and
![](./media/image78.png)![](./media/image78.png) at the demodulation
reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving
average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged demodulation
reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window size is 19 and
averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when the number of
available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs
is smaller than the moving average window size, the window size is
reduced accordingly as per figure F.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image77.png)![](./media/image77.png) and
![](./media/image78.png)![](./media/image78.png) to compute
coefficients![](./media/image79.png)![](./media/image79.png),
![](./media/image80.png)![](./media/image80.png) for each subcarrier.

E.7 EVM
=======

E.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of
![](./media/image82.png)![](./media/image82.png), according to the
timing ![](./media/image83.png)![](./media/image83.png) and
![](./media/image84.png)![](./media/image84.png), using the equalizer
coefficients from F.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
![](./media/image51.png)![](./media/image51.png) (annex E.2.2) and are
called ![](./media/image85.png)![](./media/image85.png).

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

![](./media/image86.png)

Where:

\- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

\- ![](./media/image87.png)![](./media/image87.png) is the set of
subcarriers within the resource blocks with the considered modulation
scheme being active in symbol *t*,

\- ![](./media/image85.png)![](./media/image85.png) *is* the ideal
signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in accordance with
relevant test models,

\- ![](./media/image82.png)![](./media/image82.png) is the equalized
signal under test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

E.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
------------------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) slots where
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) is the number of slots
in a 10 ms measurement interval. The averaging in the time domain equals
the ![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) slot duration of
the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation step.

![](./media/image88.png)![](./media/image88.png)

*Where* ![](./media/image89.png)![](./media/image89.png) is the number
of resource blocks with the considered modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus ![](./media/image90.png)![](./media/image90.png) is calculated
using ![](./media/image91.png)![](./media/image91.png) in the
expressions above and ![](./media/image92.png)![](./media/image92.png)
is calculated using ![](./media/image93.png)![](./media/image93.png) in
the ![](./media/image94.png)![](./media/image94.png) calculation where
(*l* and *h*, low and high; where low is the timing
![](./media/image83.png)![](./media/image83.png) and high is the timing
![](./media/image84.png)![](./media/image84.png)).

Thus:

![](./media/image95.png)![](./media/image95.png)

The resulting ![](./media/image96.png)![](./media/image96.png) is
compared against the limit.

E.7.2 Averaged EVM (TDD)
------------------------

Let ![](./media/image97.png)![](./media/image97.png) be the number of
slots with downlink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For
TDD, the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from
![](./media/image97.png)![](./media/image97.png) slots of different 10
ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum of
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) slots averaging length
where ![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) is the number of
slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

![](./media/image94.png)![](./media/image94.png) is derived by: Square
the EVM results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares,
divide the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

![](./media/image98.png)![](./media/image98.png)

*Where* ![](./media/image89.png)![](./media/image89.png) is the number
of resource blocks with the considered modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The ![](./media/image99.png)![](./media/image99.png) is calculated,
using the maximum of ![](./media/image94.png)![](./media/image94.png) at
the window *W* extremities. Thus
![](./media/image90.png)![](./media/image90.png) is calculated using
![](./media/image91.png)![](./media/image91.png) and
![](./media/image92.png)![](./media/image92.png) is calculated using
![](./media/image93.png)![](./media/image93.png) (*l* and *h*, low and
high; where low is the timing
![](./media/image83.png)![](./media/image83.png) and and high is the
timing ![](./media/image84.png)![](./media/image84.png)).

![](./media/image100.png)![](./media/image100.png)

In order to unite at least
![](./media/image56.png)![](./media/image56.png) slots, consider the
minimum integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where
![](./media/image101.png)![](./media/image101.png) is determined by.

![](./media/image102.png)![](./media/image102.png)

and ![](./media/image103.png)![](./media/image103.png) for 15 kHz SCS,
![](./media/image104.png)![](./media/image104.png) for 30 kHz SCS and
![](./media/image105.png)![](./media/image105.png) for 60 kHz SCS normal
CP.

Unite by RMS.

![](./media/image106.png)

The resulting ![](./media/image96.png)![](./media/image96.png) is

domain by

.

G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

G.2.1 General
-------------

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

G.2.2 Delay profiles
--------------------

### G.2.2.1 General

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[24\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.2.1 can be used as such.

\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[24\].

\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[24\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge
the taps as follows:

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered):

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise:

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of
the power of the weakest tap and the selected tap:

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.2.2-2, G.2.2.2-3, and
G.2.1.1-4 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### G.2.2.2 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in G.2.2.2-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables G.2.2.2-2 \~ table G.2.2.2-4.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in table G.2.4.2.3-2, G.2.4.2.3-3 and G.2.4.2.3-4 as below.

The values in table G.2.4.2.3-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 high
correlation case to ensure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](./media/image121.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.27847222222222223in"}

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a = 0.00010.

### G.2.4.3 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

#### G.2.4.3.1 General

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex G.2.4.3 apply to
two cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both NCR-MT and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at NCR-MT.
For multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with
+90/0 degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at NCR-MT.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.
