##### (1) {#section .H6}

**with** { UE in RRC\_Connected }

**ensure that** {

**when** { SS sends an RRCReconfiguration message including
RACH-ConfigDedicated information element }

**then** { UE sends a prach preamble given in the RACH-ConfigDedicated
on the target cell }

}

##### (2) {#section-1 .H6}

**with** { UE in RRC\_Connected state after transmission of a PRACH
preamble on NR SpCell received in RACH-ConfigDedicated on the target
cell }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE does not receive a matching Random Access response in
ra-ResponseWindowSize (hence considers RACH attempt as failed) and
PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER is less than PREAMBLE\_TRANS\_MAX }

**then** { UE retransmits a PRACH preamble received in
RACH-ConfigDedicated on the target cell }

}

##### 7.1.1.1.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.1.2, 5.1.4. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.2\]

The MAC entity shall:

> ...

1\> else if the *ra-PreambleIndex* has been explicitly provided by
PDCCH; and

1\> if the *ra-PreambleIndex* is not 0b000000:

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to the signalled *ra-PreambleIndex*;

2\> select the SSB signalled by PDCCH.

1\> else if the contention-free Random Access Resources associated with
SSBs have been explicitly provided in *rach-ConfigDedicated* and at
least one SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB* amongst the
associated SSBs is available:

2\> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB* amongst the
associated SSBs;

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to a *ra-PreambleIndex* corresponding to
the selected SSB.

...

1\> else if an SSB is selected above:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by
the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured or indicated by PDCCH (the
MAC entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability
amongst the consecutive PRACH occasions according to clause 8.1 of TS
38.213 \[6\], corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may take
into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected SSB).

1\> else if a CSI-RS is selected above:

2\> if there is no contention-free Random Access Resource associated
with the selected CSI-RS:

3\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH
occasions, permitted by the restrictions given by the
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured, corresponding to the SSB in
*candidateBeamRSList* which is quasi-collocated with the selected CSI-RS
as specified in TS 38.214 \[7\] (the MAC entity shall select a PRACH
occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the consecutive PRACH
occasions according to clause 8.1 of TS 38.213 \[6\], corresponding to
the SSB which is quasi-collocated with the selected CSI-RS; the MAC
entity may take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps
when determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
SSB which is quasi-collocated with the selected CSI-RS).

2\> else:

3\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
in *ra-OccasionList* corresponding to the selected CSI-RS (the MAC
entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability
amongst the PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously but on different
subcarriers, corresponding to the selected CSI-RS; the MAC entity may
take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected CSI-RS).

1\> perform the Random Access Preamble transmission procedure (see
clause 5.1.3).

NOTE: When the UE determines if there is an SSB with SS-RSRP above
*rsrp-ThresholdSSB* or a CSI-RS with CSI-RSRP above
*rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS*, the UE uses the latest unfiltered L1-RSRP
measurement.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4\]

Once the Random Access Preamble is transmitted and regardless of the
possible occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

1\> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in
*BeamFailureRecoveryConfig* at the first PDCCH occasion as specified in
TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor for a PDCCH transmission on the search space indicated by
*recoverySearchSpaceId* of the SpCell identified by the C-RNTI while
*ra-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> else:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* at
the first PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of
the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response(s)
identified by the RA-RNTI while the *ra-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission on the search
space indicated by *recoverySearchSpaceId* is received from lower layers
on the Serving Cell where the preamble was transmitted; and

1\> if PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; and

1\> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:

2\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

1\> else if a downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the
RA-RNTI and the received TB is successfully decoded:

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Backoff
Indicator:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to value of the BI field of the MAC
subPDU using Table 7.2-1, multiplied with *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI*.

2\> else:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to 0 ms.

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX* (see clause 5.1.3):

3\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful.

2\> if the Random Access Response reception is considered successful:

3\> if the Random Access Response includes a MAC subPDU with RAPID only:

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed;

4\> indicate the reception of an acknowledgement for SI request to upper
layers.

3\> else:

4\> apply the following actions for the Serving Cell where the Random
Access Preamble was transmitted:

5\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see clause 5.2);

5\> indicate the *preambleReceivedTargetPower* and the amount of power
ramping applied to the latest Random Access Preamble transmission to
lower layers (i.e. (*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*);

5\> if the Random Access procedure for an SCell is performed on uplink
carrier where *pusch-Config* is not configured:

6\> ignore the received UL grant.

5\> else:

6\> process the received UL grant value and indicate it to the lower
layers.

4\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

5\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

4\> else:

5\> set the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI* to the value received in the Random
Access Response;

5\> if this is the first successfully received Random Access Response
within this Random Access procedure:

6\> if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel:

> 7\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a
> C-RNTI MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

6\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly
entity and store it in the Msg3 buffer.

NOTE: If within a Random Access procedure, an uplink grant provided in
the Random Access Response for the same group of contention-based Random
Access Preambles has a different size than the first uplink grant
allocated during that Random Access procedure, the UE behaviour is not
defined.

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *BeamFailureRecoveryConfig*
expires and if a PDCCH transmission on the search space indicated by
*recoverySearchSpaceId* addressed to the C-RNTI has not been received on
the Serving Cell where the preamble was transmitted; or

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* expires,
and if the Random Access Response containing Random Access Preamble
identifiers that matches the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* has not been
received:

2\> consider the Random Access Response reception not successful;

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* by 1;

2\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* = *preambleTransMax* + 1:

3\> if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on the SpCell:

4\> indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers;

4\> if this Random Access procedure was triggered for SI request:

5\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

3\> else if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on an SCell:

4\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

2\> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:

3\> select a random backoff time according to a uniform distribution
between 0 and the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF*;

3\> if the criteria (as defined in clause 5.1.2) to select
contention-free Random Access Resources is met during the backoff time:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see clause
5.1.2);

3\> else:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see clause
5.1.2) after the backoff time.

The MAC entity may stop *ra-ResponseWindow* (and hence monitoring for
Random Access Response(s)) after successful reception of a Random Access
Response containing Random Access Preamble identifiers that matches the
transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX*.

HARQ operation is not applicable to the Random Access Response
reception.

##### 7.1.1.1.1a.2 Conformance requirements {#a.2-conformance-requirements .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.1.2, 5.1.4 and TS 38.212
clause 7.3.1.2.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.2\]

The MAC entity shall:

> ...

1\> else if the *ra-PreambleIndex* has been explicitly provided by
either PDCCH or RRC; and

1\> if the *ra-PreambleIndex* is not 0b000000; and

1\> if contention-free Random Access Resource associated with SSBs or
CSI-RS have not been explicitly provided by RRC:

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to the signalled *ra-PreambleIndex*.

...

1\> if an SSB is selected above and an association between PRACH
occasions and SSBs is configured:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by
the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured (the MAC entity may take
into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected SSB).

1\> else if a CSI-RS is selected above and an association between PRACH
occasions and CSI-RSs is configured:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
in *ra-OccasionList* corresponding to the selected CSI-RS (the MAC
entity may take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps
when determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected CSI-RS).

1\> else:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion (the MAC entity may take
into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion).

1\> perform the Random Access Preamble transmission procedure (see
clause 5.1.3).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4\]

Once the Random Access Preamble is transmitted and regardless of the
possible occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

\...

1\> else:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* at
the first PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of
the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response(s)
identified by the RA-RNTI while the *ra-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission is received
from lower layers; and

1\> if PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; and

\...

1\> else if a downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the
RA-RNTI and the received TB is successfully decoded:

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a Backoff Indicator
subheader:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to value of the BI field of the Backoff
Indicator subheader using Table 7.2-1.

2\> else:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to 0 ms.

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a Random Access Preamble
identifier corresponding to the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* (see
subclause 5.1.3):

3\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful.

2\> if the Random Access Response reception is considered successful:

3\> if the Random Access Response includes RAPID only:

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed;

4\> indicate the reception of an acknowledgement for the SI request to
upper layers.

3\> else:

4\> apply the following actions for the Serving Cell where the Random
Access Preamble was transmitted:

5\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see subclause 5.2);

5\> indicate the *preambleReceivedTargetPower* and the amount of power
ramping applied to the latest Random Access Preamble transmission to
lower layers (i.e. (*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*preamblePowerRampingStep*);

5\> if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is SRS-only
SCell:

6\> ignore the received UL grant.

5\> else:

6\> process the received UL grant value and indicate it to the lower
layers.

4\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

5\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

\...

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* expires,
and if the Random Access Response containing Random Access Preamble
identifiers that matches the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* has not been
received; or:

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *BeamFailureRecoveryConfig*
expires and if the PDCCH addressed to the C-RNTI has not been received:

2\> consider the Random Access Response reception not successful;

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* by 1;

2\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* = *preambleTxMax* + 1:

3\> if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on the SpCell:

4\> indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers.

3\> else if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on a SCell:

4\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

2\> if in this Random Access procedure, the Random Access Preamble was
selected by MAC among the contention-based Random Access Preambles:

3\> select a random backoff time according to a uniform distribution
between 0 and the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF*;

3\> delay the subsequent Random Access Preamble transmission by the
backoff time.

2\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see
subclause 5.1.2).

The MAC entity may stop *ra-ResponseWindow* (and hence monitoring for
Random Access Response(s)) after successful reception of a Random Access
Response containing Random Access Preamble identifiers that matches the
transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX*.

HARQ operation is not applicable to the Random Access Response
transmission.

Preamble index\" is not all zeros and if the UE is configured with SUL
in the cell, this field indicates which UL carrier in the cell to
transmit the PRACH according to Table 7.3.1.1.1-1; otherwise, this field
is reserved

\- SS/PBCH index -- 6 bits. If the value of the \"Random Access Preamble
index\" is not all zeros, this field indicates the SS/PBCH that shall be
used to determine the RACH occasion for the PRACH transmission;
otherwise, this field is reserved.

\- PRACH Mask index -- 4 bits. If the value of the \"Random Access
Preamble index\" is not all zeros, this field indicates the RACH
occasion associated with the SS/PBCH indicated by \"SS/PBCH index\" for
the PRACH transmission, according to Subclause 5.1.1 of \[8, TS38.321\];
otherwise, this field is reserved

\- Reserved bits -- 10 bits

5.2, 6.1.3.2, 6.1.5 and 6.2.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15
requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.2\]

The MAC entity shall:

> ...

1\> else (i.e. for the contention-based Random Access preamble
selection):

2\> if at least one of the SSBs with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*
is available:

3\> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*.

2\> else:

3\> select any SSB.

2\> if Msg3 has not yet been transmitted:

3\> if Random Access Preambles group B is configured:

4\> if the potential Msg3 size (UL data available for transmission plus
MAC header and, where required, MAC CEs) is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA* and the pathloss is less than *PCMAX* (of the
Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure)
--*preambleReceivedTargetPower* -- *msg3-DeltaPreamble* --
*messagePowerOffsetGroupB*; or

4\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for the CCCH logical
channel and the CCCH SDU size plus MAC subheader is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA*:5\> select the Random Access Preambles group B.

4\> else:

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

3\> else:

4\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

2\> else (i.e. Msg3 is being retransmitted):

3\> select the same group of Random Access Preambles as was used for the
Random Access Preamble transmission attempt corresponding to the first
transmission of Msg3.

2\> if the association between Random Access Preambles and SSBs is
configured:

3\> select a Random Access Preamble randomly with equal probability from
the Random Access Preambles associated with the selected SSB and the
selected Random Access Preambles group.

2\> else:

3\> select a Random Access Preamble randomly with equal probability from
the Random Access Preambles within the selected Random Access Preambles
group.

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to the selected *ra-PreambleIndex*.

> ...

1\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request (as
specified in TS 38.331 \[5\]); and

> 1\> if *ra-AssociationPeriodIndex* and *si-RequestPeriod* are
> configured:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB in the association period given by
*ra-AssociationPeriodIndex* in the *si-RequestPeriod* permitted by the
restrictions given by the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* (the MAC entity
shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst
the consecutive PRACH occasions according to subclause 8.1 of TS 38.213
\[6\] corresponding to the selected SSB).

1\> else if an SSB is selected above:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by
the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured (the MAC entity shall
select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the
consecutive PRACH occasions according to subclause 8.1 of TS 38.213
\[6\], corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may take into
account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when determining the
next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the selected SSB).

1\> else if a CSI-RS is selected above:

2\> if there is no contention-free Random Access Resource associated
with the selected CSI-RS:

3\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH
occasions, permitted by the restrictions given by the
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured, corresponding to the SSB in
*candidateBeamRSList* which is quasi-collocated with the selected CSI-RS
as specified in TS 38.214 \[7\] (the MAC entity may take into account
the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when determining the next
available PRACH occasion corresponding to the SSB which is
quasi-collected with the selected CSI-RS).

2\> else:

3\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
in *ra-OccasionList* corresponding to the selected CSI-RS (the MAC
entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability
amongst the PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously but on different
subcarriers, corresponding to the selected CSI-RS; the MAC entity may
take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected CSI-RS).

1\> perform the Random Access Preamble transmission procedure (see
subclause 5.1.3).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3\]

The MAC entity shall, for each Random Access Preamble:

1\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* is greater than one; and

1\> if the notification of suspending power ramping counter has not been
received from lower layers; and

1\> if SSB selected is not changed (i.e. same as the previous Random
Access Preamble transmission):

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* by 1.

1\> select the value of *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* according to subclause 7.3;

1\> set *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER* to
*preambleReceivedTargetPower* + *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* +
(*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*;

1\> except for contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request, compute the RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion
in which the Random Access Preamble is transmitted;

1\> instruct the physical layer to transmit the Random Access Preamble
using the selected PRACH, corresponding RA-RNTI (if available),
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX* and *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER*.

The RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH in which the Random Access
Preamble is transmitted, is computed as:

RA-RNTI= 1 + s\_id + 14 × t\_id + 14 × 80 × f\_id + 14 × 80 × 8 ×
ul\_carrier\_id

where s\_id is the index of the first OFDM symbol of the specified PRACH
(0 ≤ s\_id \< 14), t\_id is the index of the first slot of the specified
PRACH in a system frame (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), f\_id is the index of the
specified PRACH in the frequency domain (0 ≤ f\_id \< 8), and
ul\_carrier\_id is the UL carrier used for Msg1 transmission (0 for NUL
carrier, and 1 for SUL carrier).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4\]

Once the Random Access Preamble is transmitted and regardless of the
possible occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

> ...

1\> else:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* at
the first PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of
the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response(s)
identified by the RA-RNTI while the *ra-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission is received
from lower layers on the Serving Cell where the preamble was
transmitted; and

1\> if PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; and

1\> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:

2\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

1\> else if a downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the
RA-RNTI and the received TB is successfully decoded:

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Backoff
Indicator:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to value of the BI field of the MAC
subPDU using Table 7.2-1, multiplied with *SCALING\_FACTOR\_B*I.

2\> else:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to 0 ms.

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX* (see subclause 5.1.3):

3\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful.

2\> if the Random Access Response reception is considered successful:

3\> if the Random Access Response includes RAPID only:

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed;

4\> indicate the reception of an acknowledgement for the SI request to
upper layers.

3\> else:

4\> apply the following actions for the Serving Cell where the Random
Access Preamble was transmitted:

5\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see subclause 5.2);

5\> indicate the *preambleReceivedTargetPower* and the amount of power
ramping applied to the latest Random Access Preamble transmission to
lower layers (i.e. (*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*preamblePowerRampingStep*).

5\> if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is SRS-only
SCell:

6\> ignore the received UL grant.

5\> else:

6\> process the received UL grant value and indicate it to the lower
layers.

4\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

5\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

4\> else:

5\> set the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI* to the value received in the Random
Access Response;

> ...

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* expires,
and if the Random Access Response containing Random Access Preamble
identifiers that matches the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* has not been
received; or

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *BeamFailureRecoveryConfig*
expires and if the PDCCH addressed to the C-RNTI has not been received
on the Serving Cell where the preamble was transmitted:

2\> consider the Random Access Response reception not successful;

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* by 1;

2\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* = *preambleTxMax* + 1:

3\> if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on the SpCell:

4\> indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers.

4\> if this Random Access procedure was triggered for SI request:

5\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

\> else if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on a SCell:

4\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

2\> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:

3\> select a random backoff time according to a uniform distribution
between 0 and the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF*;

3\> if the criteria (as defined in subclause 5.1.2) to select
contention-free Random Access Resources is met during the backoff time:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see
subclause 5.1.2);

3\> else:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see
subclause 5.1.2) after the backoff time.

The MAC entity may stop *ra-ResponseWindow* (and hence monitoring for
Random Access Response(s)) after successful reception of a Random Access
Response containing Random Access Preamble identifiers that matches the
transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX*.

HARQ operation is not applicable to the Random Access Response
transmission.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.5\]

Once Msg3 is transmitted, the MAC entity shall:

1\> start the *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer* and restart the
*ra-ContentionResolutionTimer* at each HARQ retransmission in the first
symbol after the end of the Msg3 transmission;

1\> monitor the PDCCH while the *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer* is
running regardless of the possible occurrence of a measurement gap;

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission of the SpCell
is received from lower layers:

2\> if the C-RNTI MAC CE was included in Msg3:

3\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated by the MAC sublayer
itself or by the RRC sublayer and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to
the C-RNTI and contains a UL grant for a new transmission; or

3\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated by a PDCCH order and
the PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; or

3\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated by a beam failure
indication from lower layer and the PDCCH transmission is addressed to
the C-RNTI:

4\> consider this Contention Resolution successful;

4\> stop *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer*;

4\> discard the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*;

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed.

...

1\> if *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer* expires:

2\> discard the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*;

2\> consider the Contention Resolution not successful.

1\> if the Contention Resolution is considered not successful:

2\> flush the HARQ buffer used for transmission of the MAC PDU in the
Msg3 buffer;

2\> increment PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER by 1;

2\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* = *preambleTxMax* + 1:

3\> indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers.

3\> if this Random Access procedure was triggered for SI request:

4\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

2\> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:

3\> select a random backoff time according to a uniform distribution
between 0 and the PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF;

3\> if the criteria (as defined in subclause 5.1.2) to select
contention-free Random Access Resources is met during the backoff time:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see
subclause 5.1.2);

3\> else:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see
subclause 5.1.2) after the backoff time.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.2\]

RRC configures the following parameters for the maintenance of UL time
alignment:

\- *timeAlignmentTimer* (per TAG) which controls how long the MAC entity
considers the Serving Cells belonging to the associated TAG to be uplink
time aligned.

The MAC entity shall:

1\> when a Timing Advance Command MAC CE is received, and if a N~TA~ (as
defined in TS 38.211 \[8\]) has been maintained with the indicated TAG:

2\> apply the Timing Advance Command for the indicated TAG;

2\> start or restart the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the
indicated TAG.

...

1\> when a *timeAlignmentTimer* expires:

2\> if the *timeAlignmentTimer* is associated with the PTAG:

3\> flush all HARQ buffers for all Serving Cells;

3\> notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells, if configured;

3\> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells, if configured;

3\> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink
grants;

3\> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;

3\> consider all running *timeAlignmentTimer*s as expired;

3\> maintain N~TA~ (defined in TS 38.211 \[8\]) of all TAGs.

2\> else if the *timeAlignmentTimer* is associated with an STAG, then
for all Serving Cells belonging to this TAG*:*

3\> flush all HARQ buffers;

3\> notify RRC to release PUCCH, if configured;

3\> notify RRC to release SRS, if configured;

3\> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink
grants;

3\> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;

3\> maintain N~TA~ (defined in TS 38.211 \[8\]) of this TAG.

When the MAC entity stops uplink transmissions for an SCell due to the
fact that the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs
of the MAC entity or the maximum uplink transmission timing difference
between TAGs of any MAC entity of the UE is exceeded, the MAC entity
considers the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the SCell as expired.

The MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission on a Serving
Cell except the Random Access Preamble transmission when the
*timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the TAG to which this Serving Cell
belongs is not running. Furthermore, when the *timeAlignmentTimer*
associated with the pTAG is not running, the MAC entity shall not
perform any uplink transmission on any Serving Cell except the Random
Access Preamble transmission on the SpCell.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.3.2\]

The C-RNTI MAC CE is identified by MAC PDU subheader with LCID as
specified in Table 6.2.1-2.

It has a fixed size and consists of a single field defined as follows
(Figure 6.1.3.2-1):

\- C-RNTI: This field contains the C-RNTI of the MAC entity. The length
of the field is 16 bits.

![](./media/image1.emf)

Figure 6.1.3.2-1: C-RNTI MAC CE

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.5\]

A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs and optionally padding.
Each MAC subPDU consists one of the following:

\- a MAC subheader with Backoff Indicator only;

\- a MAC subheader with RAPID only (i.e. acknowledgment for SI request);

\- a MAC subheader with RAPID and MAC RAR.

A MAC subheader with Backoff Indicator consists of five header fields
E/T/R/R/BI as described in Figure 6.1.5-1. A MAC subPDU with Backoff
Indicator only is placed at the beginning of the MAC PDU, if included.
\'MAC subPDU(s) with RAPID only\' and \'MAC subPDU(s) with RAPID and MAC
RAR\' can be placed anywhere between MAC subPDU with Backoff Indicator
only (if any) and padding (if any).

A MAC subheader with RAPID consists of three header fields E/T/RAPID as
described in Figure 6.1.5-2.

Padding is placed at the end of the MAC PDU if present. Presence and
length of padding is implicit based on TB size, size of MAC subPDU(s).

Figure 6.1.5-3: Example of MAC PDU consisting of MAC RARs

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.2.3\]

The MAC RAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3-1, and consists
of the following fields:

\- R: Reserved bit, set to \"0\";

\- Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates
the index value *T~A~* used to control the amount of timing adjustment
that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the
Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits;

\- UL Grant: The Uplink Grant field indicates the resources to be used
on the uplink in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the UL Grant field is 27
bits;

\- Temporary C-RNTI: The Temporary C-RNTI field indicates the temporary
identity that is used by the MAC entity during Random Access. The size
of the Temporary C-RNTI field is 16 bits.

The MAC RAR is octet aligned.

2\> else:

3\> select any SSB.

2\> if Msg3 has not yet been transmitted:

3\> if Random Access Preambles group B is configured:

4\> if the potential Msg3 size (UL data available for transmission plus
MAC header and, where required, MAC CEs) is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA* and the pathloss is less than *PCMAX* (of the
Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure) --
*preambleReceivedTargetPower* -- *msg3-DeltaPreamble* --

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group B.

4\> else:

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

3\> else:

4\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

2\> else (i.e. Msg3 is being retransmitted):

3\> select the same group of Random Access Preambles as was used for the
Random Access Preamble transmission attempt corresponding to the first
transmission of Msg3.

2\> if the association between Random Access Preambles and SSBs is
configured:

3\> select a *ra-PreambleIndex* randomly with equal probability from the
Random Access Preambles associated with the selected SSB and the
selected Random Access Preambles group.

2\> else:

3\> select a *ra-PreambleIndex* randomly with equal probability from the
Random Access Preambles within the selected Random Access Preambles
group.

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to the selected *ra-PreambleIndex*.

1\> if an SSB is selected above and an association between PRACH
occasions and SSBs is configured:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by
the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured (the MAC entity shall
select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the
PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously but on different subcarriers,
corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may take into account
the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when determining the next
available PRACH occasion corresponding to the selected SSB).

1\> else if a CSI-RS is selected above and an association between PRACH
occasions and CSI-RSs is configured:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
in *ra-OccasionList* corresponding to the selected CSI-RS (the MAC
entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability
amongst the PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously but on different
subcarriers, corresponding to the selected CSI-RS; the MAC entity may
take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected CSI-RS).

1\> else if Random Access procedure was initiated for beam failure
recovery; and

1\> if a CSI-RS is selected above and there is no contention-free Random
Access Resource associated with the selected CSI-RS:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH
occasions, permitted by the restrictions given by the
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured, corresponding to the SSB in
*candidateBeamRSList* which is quasi-collocated with the selected CSI-RS
as specified in TS 38.214 \[7\] (the MAC entity may take into account
the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when determining the next
available PRACH occasion corresponding to the SSB which is
quasi-collected with the selected CSI-RS).

1\> else:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion (the MAC entity shall
select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the
PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously but on different subcarriers;
the MAC entity may take into account the possible occurrence of
measurement gaps when determining the next available PRACH occasion).

1\> perform the Random Access Preamble transmission procedure (see
subclause 5.1.3).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3\]

The MAC entity shall, for each Random Access Preamble:

1\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* is greater than one; and

1\> if the notification of suspending power ramping counter has not been
received from lower layers; and

1\> if SSB selected is not changed (i.e. same as the previous Random
Access Preamble transmission):

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* by 1.

1\> select the value of *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* according to subclause 7.3;

1\> set *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER* to
*preambleReceivedTargetPower* + *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* +
(*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*;

1\> except for contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request, compute the RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion
in which the Random Access Preamble is transmitted;

1\> instruct the physical layer to transmit the Random Access Preamble
using the selected PRACH, corresponding RA-RNTI (if available),
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX* and *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER*.

The RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH in which the Random Access
Preamble is transmitted, is computed as:

RA-RNTI= 1 + s\_id + 14 × t\_id + 14 × 80 × f\_id + 14 × 80 × 8 ×
ul\_carrier\_id

where s\_id is the index of the first OFDM symbol of the specified PRACH
(0 ≤ s\_id \< 14), t\_id is the index of the first slot of the specified
PRACH in a system frame (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), f\_id is the index of the
specified PRACH in the frequency domain (0 ≤ f\_id \< 8), and
ul\_carrier\_id is the UL carrier used for Msg1 transmission (0 for NUL
carrier, and 1 for SUL carrier).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4\]

Once the Random Access Preamble is transmitted and regardless of the
possible occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

1\> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in
*BeamFailureRecoveryConfig* at the first PDCCH occasion as specified in
TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for response to beam failure
recovery request identified by the C-RNTI while *ra-ResponseWindow* is
running.

1\> else:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* at
the first PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of
the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response(s)
identified by the RA-RNTI while the *ra-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission is received
from lower layers; and

1\> if PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; and

1\> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:

2\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

1\> else if a downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the
RA-RNTI and the received TB is successfully decoded:

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Backoff
Indicator:

transmission.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.5\]

A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs and optionally padding.
Each MAC subPDU consists one of the following:

\- a MAC subheader with Backoff Indicator only;

\- a MAC subheader with RAPID only (i.e. acknowledgment for SI request);

\- a MAC subheader with RAPID and MAC RAR.

A MAC subheader with Backoff Indicator consists of five header fields
E/T/R/R/BI as described in Figure 6.1.5-1. A MAC subPDU with Backoff
Indicator only is placed at the beginning of the MAC PDU, if included.
\'MAC subPDU(s) with RAPID only\' and \'MAC subPDU(s) with RAPID and MAC
RAR\' can be placed anywhere between MAC subPDU with Backoff Indicator
only (if any) and padding (if any).

A MAC subheader with RAPID consists of three header fields E/T/RAPID as
described in Figure 6.1.5-2.

Padding is placed at the end of the MAC PDU if present. Presence and
length of padding is implicit based on TB size, size of MAC subPDU(s).

1\> if the Random Access Resources for SI request have been explicitly
provided by RRC:

2\> if at least one of the SSBs with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*
is available:

3\> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*.

2\> else:

3\> select any SSB.

2\> select a Random Access Preamble corresponding to the selected SSB,
from the Random Access Preamble(s) determined according to
*ra-PreambleStartIndex* as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\];

1\> else (i.e. for the contention-based Random Access preamble
selection):

2\> if at least one of the SSBs with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*
is available:

3\> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*.

2\> else:

3\> select any SSB.

2\> if Msg3 has not yet been transmitted:

3\> if Random Access Preambles group B is configured:

4\> if the potential Msg3 size (UL data available for transmission plus
MAC header and, where required, MAC CEs) is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA* and the pathloss is less than *PCMAX* (of the
Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure) --
*preambleReceivedTargetPower* -- *msg3-DeltaPreamble* --
*messagePowerOffsetGroupB*; or

4\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for the CCCH logical
channel and the CCCH SDU size plus MAC subheader is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA*:

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group B.

4\> else:

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

3\> else:

4\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

2\> else (i.e. Msg3 is being retransmitted):

3\> select the same group of Random Access Preambles as was used for the
Random Access Preamble transmission attempt corresponding to the first
transmission of Msg3.

2\> if the association between Random Access Preambles and SSBs is
configured:

3\> select a Random Access Preamble randomly with equal probability from
the Random Access Preambles associated with the selected SSB and the
selected Random Access Preambles group.

2\> else:

3\> select a Random Access Preamble randomly with equal probability from
the Random Access Preambles within the selected Random Access Preambles
group.

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to the selected Random Access Preamble.

1\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request (as
specified in TS 38.331 \[5\]); and

1\> if *ra-AssociationPeriodIndex* and *si-RequestPeriod* are
configured:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB in the association period given by
*ra-AssociationPeriodIndex* in the *si-RequestPeriod* permitted by the
restrictions given by the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* (the MAC entity
shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst
the consecutive PRACH occasions according to subclause 8.1 of TS 38.213
\[6\] corresponding to the selected SSB).

1\> else if an SSB is selected above:

2\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by
the *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured (the MAC entity shall
select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability amongst the
consecutive PRACH occasions according to subclause 8.1 of TS 38.213
\[6\], corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may take into
account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when determining the
next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the selected SSB).

1\> else if a CSI-RS is selected above:

2\> if there is no contention-free Random Access Resource associated
with the selected CSI-RS:

3\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH
occasions, permitted by the restrictions given by the
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* if configured, corresponding to the SSB in
*candidateBeamRSList* which is quasi-collocated with the selected CSI-RS
as specified in TS 38.214 \[7\] (the MAC entity may take into account
the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when determining the next
available PRACH occasion corresponding to the SSB which is
quasi-collected with the selected CSI-RS).

2\> else:

3\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
in *ra-OccasionList* corresponding to the selected CSI-RS (the MAC
entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability
amongst the PRACH occasions occurring simultaneously but on different
subcarriers, corresponding to the selected CSI-RS; the MAC entity may
take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected CSI-RS).

1\> perform the Random Access Preamble transmission procedure (see
subclause 5.1.3).

NOTE: When the UE determines if there is an SSB with SS-RSRP above
*rsrp-ThresholdSSB* or a CSI-RS with CSI-RSRP above
*rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS*, the UE uses the latest unfiltered L1-RSRP
measurement.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4\]

Once the Random Access Preamble is transmitted and regardless of the
possible occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

1\> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in
*BeamFailureRecoveryConfig* at the first PDCCH occasion as specified in
TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for response to beam failure
recovery request identified by the C-RNTI while *ra-ResponseWindow* is
running.

1\> else:

2\> start the *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* at
the first PDCCH occasion as specified in TS 38.213 \[6\] from the end of
the Random Access Preamble transmission;

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response(s)
identified by the RA-RNTI while the *ra-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission is received
from lower layers on the Serving Cell where the preamble was
transmitted; and

1\> if PDCCH transmission is addressed to the C-RNTI; and

1\> if the contention-free Random Access Preamble for beam failure
recovery request was transmitted by the MAC entity:

2\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

1\> else if a downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the
RA-RNTI and the received TB is successfully decoded:

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Backoff
Indicator:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to value of the BI field of the MAC
subPDU using Table 7.2-1, multiplied with *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI*.

2\> else:

3\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to 0 ms.

2\> if the Random Access Response contains a MAC subPDU with Random
Access Preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX* (see subclause 5.1.3):

3\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful.

2\> if the Random Access Response reception is considered successful:

3\> if the Random Access Response includes a MAC subPDU with RAPID only:

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed;

4\> indicate the reception of an acknowledgement for SI request to upper
layers.

3\> else:

4\> apply the following actions for the Serving Cell where the Random
Access Preamble was transmitted:

5\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see subclause 5.2);

5\> indicate the *preambleReceivedTargetPower* and the amount of power
ramping applied to the latest Random Access Preamble transmission to
lower layers (i.e. (*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*);

5\> if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is SRS-only
SCell:

6\> ignore the received UL grant.

5\> else:

6\> process the received UL grant value and indicate it to the lower
layers.

4\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

5\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

4\> else:

5\> set the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI* to the value received in the Random
Access Response;

5\> if this is the first successfully received Random Access Response
within this Random Access procedure:

6\> if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel:

> 7\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a
> C-RNTI MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

6\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly
entity and store it in the Msg3 buffer.

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* expires,
and if the Random Access Response containing Random Access Preamble
identifiers that matches the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* has not been
received; or

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *BeamFailureRecoveryConfig*
expires and if the PDCCH addressed to the C-RNTI has not been received
on the Serving Cell where the preamble was transmitted:

2\> consider the Random Access Response reception not successful;

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* by 1;

2\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* = *preambleTransMax* + 1:

3\> if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on the SpCell:

4\> indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers;

4\> if this Random Access procedure was triggered for SI request:

5\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

3\> else if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted on a SCell:

4\> consider the Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

2\> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:

3\> select a random backoff time according to a uniform distribution
between 0 and the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF*;

3\> if the criteria (as defined in subclause 5.1.2) to select
contention-free Random Access Resources is met during the backoff time:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see
subclause 5.1.2);

3\> else:

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see
subclause 5.1.2) after the backoff time.

The MAC entity may stop *ra-ResponseWindow* (and hence monitoring for
Random Access Response(s)) after successful reception of a Random Access
Response containing Random Access Preamble identifiers that matches the
transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX*.

HARQ operation is not applicable to the Random Access Response
transmission.

##### 7.1.1.1.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-4 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in TS 38.321: clause 5.1.1 and clause 5.16. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1\]

The Random Access procedure described in this clause is initiated by a
PDCCH order, by the MAC entity itself, or by RRC for the events in
accordance with TS 38.300 \[2\]. There is only one Random Access
procedure ongoing at any point in time in a MAC entity. The Random
Access procedure on an SCell shall only be initiated by a PDCCH order
with *ra-PreambleIndex* different from 0b000000.

NOTE 1: If a new Random Access procedure is triggered while another is
already ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation whether
to continue with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure
(e.g. for SI request).

RRC configures the following parameters for the Random Access procedure:

\- *prach-ConfigurationIndex*: the available set of PRACH occasions for
the transmission of the Random Access Preamble;

\- *preambleReceivedTargetPower*: initial Random Access Preamble power;

\- *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*: an RSRP threshold for the selection of the SSB.
If the Random Access procedure is initiated for beam failure recovery,
*rsrp-ThresholdSSB* used for the selection of the SSB within
*candidateBeamRSList* refers to *rsrp-ThresholdSSB* in
*BeamFailureRecoveryConfig* IE;

\- *rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS*: an RSRP threshold for the selection of
CSI-RS. If the Random Access procedure is initiated for beam failure
recovery, *rsrp-ThresholdCSI-RS* is equal to *rsrp-ThresholdSSB* in
*BeamFailureRecoveryConfig* IE;

\- *rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL*: an RSRP threshold for the selection between
the NUL carrier and the SUL carrier;

\- *candidateBeamRSList*: a list of reference signals (CSI*-RS* and/or
SSB) identifying the candidate beams for recovery and the associated
Random Access parameters;

\- *recoverySearchSpaceId*: the search space identity for monitoring the
response of the beam failure recovery request;

\- *powerRampingStep*: the power-ramping factor;

\- *powerRampingStepHighPriority*: the power-ramping factor in case of
prioritized Random Access procedure;

\- *scalingFactorBI*: a scaling factor for prioritized Random Access
procedure;

\- *ra-PreambleIndex*: Random Access Preamble;

\- *ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex*: defines PRACH occasion(s) associated with
an SSB in which the MAC entity may transmit a Random Access Preamble
(see clause 7.4);

\- *ra-OccasionList*: defines PRACH occasion(s) associated with a CSI-RS
in which the MAC entity may transmit a Random Access Preamble;

\- *ra-PreambleStartIndex*: the starting index of Random Access
Preamble(s) for on-demand SI request;

\- *preambleTransMax*: the maximum number of Random Access Preamble
transmission;

\- *ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB*: defines the number of
SSBs mapped to each PRACH occasion and the number of contention-based
Random Access Preambles mapped to each SSB;

\- if *groupBconfigured* is configured, then Random Access Preambles
group B is configured.

\- Amongst the contention-based Random Access Preambles associated with
an SSB (as defined in TS 38.213 \[6\]), the first
*numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA* Random Access Preambles belong to Random
Access Preambles group A. The remaining Random Access Preambles
associated with the SSB belong to Random Access Preambles group B (if
configured).

NOTE 2: If Random Access Preambles group B is supported by the cell
Random Access Preambles group B is included for each SSB.

\- if Random Access Preambles group B is configured:

\- *ra-Msg3SizeGroupA*: the threshold to determine the groups of Random
Access Preambles;

\- *msg3-DeltaPreamble*: ∆*~PREAMBLE\_Msg3~* in TS 38.213 \[6\];

\- *messagePowerOffsetGroupB*: the power offset for preamble selection;

\- *numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA*: defines the number of Random Access
Preambles in Random Access Preamble group A for each SSB.

\- the set of Random Access Preambles and/or PRACH occasions for SI
request, if any;

\- the set of Random Access Preambles and/or PRACH occasions for beam
failure recovery request, if any;

\- the set of Random Access Preambles and/or PRACH occasions for
reconfiguration with sync, if any;

\- *ra-ResponseWindow*: the time window to monitor RA response(s)
(SpCell only);

\- *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer*: the Contention Resolution Timer
(SpCell only).

In addition, the following information for related Serving Cell is
assumed to be available for UEs:

\- if Random Access Preambles group B is configured:

\- if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is configured
with supplementary uplink as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\], and SUL
carrier is selected for performing Random Access Procedure:

\- P~CMAX,f,c~ of the SUL carrier as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[14\], TS
38.101-2 \[15\], and TS 38.101-3 \[16\].

\- else:

\- P~CMAX,f,c~ of the NUL carrier as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[14\], TS
38.101-2 \[15\], and TS 38.101-3 \[16\].

The following UE variables are used for the Random Access procedure:

\- *PREAMBLE\_INDEX*;

\- *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER*;

\- *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER*;

\- *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*;

\- *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER*;

\- *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF*;

\- *PCMAX*;

\- *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI*;

\- *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*.

When the Random Access procedure is initiated on a Serving Cell, the MAC
entity shall:

1\> flush the Msg3 buffer;

1\> set the *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* to 1;

1\> set the *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* to 1;

1\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to 0 ms;

1\> if the carrier to use for the Random Access procedure is explicitly
signalled:

2\> select the signalled carrier for performing Random Access procedure;

2\> set the *PCMAX* to P~CMAX,f,c~ of the signalled carrier.

1\> else if the carrier to use for the Random Access procedure is not
explicitly signalled; and

1\> if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is configured
with supplementary uplink as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\]; and

1\> if the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than
*rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL*:

2\> select the SUL carrier for performing Random Access procedure;

2\> set the *PCMAX* to P~CMAX,f,c~ of the SUL carrier.

1\> else:

2\> select the NUL carrier for performing Random Access procedure;

2\> set the *PCMAX* to P~CMAX,f,c~ of the NUL carrier.

1\> perform the BWP operation as specified in clause 5.15;

1\> set *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP* to

*powerRampingStep*;1\> set *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI* to 1;

1\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for beam failure
recovery (as specified in clause 5.17); and

1\> if *beamFailureRecoveryConfig* is configured for the active UL BWP
of the selected carrier:

2\> start the *beamFailureRecoveryTimer*, if configured;

2\> apply the parameters *powerRampingStep*,
*preambleReceivedTargetPower*, and *preambleTransMax* configured in the
*beamFailureRecoveryConfig*;

2\> if *powerRampingStepHighPriority* is configured in the
*beamFailureRecoveryConfig*:

3\> set *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP* to the
*powerRampingStepHighPriority*.

2\> else:

3\> set *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP* to *powerRampingStep*.

2\> if *scalingFactorBI* is configured in the
*beamFailureRecoveryConfig*:

3\> set *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI* to the *scalingFactorBI*.

1\> else if the Random Access procedure was initiated for handover; and

1\> if *rach-ConfigDedicated* is configured for the selected carrier:

2\> if *powerRampingStepHighPriority* is configured in the
*rach-ConfigDedicated*:

3\> set *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP* to the
*powerRampingStepHighPriority*.

2\> if *scalingFactorBI* is configured in the *rach-ConfigDedicated*:

3\> set *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI* to the *scalingFactorBI*.

1\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see clause
5.1.2).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.16\]

The Supplementary UL (SUL) carrier can be configured as a complement to
the normal UL (NUL) carrier. Switching between the NUL carrier and the
SUL carrier means that the UL transmissions move from one carrier to the
other carrier, which is done by:

\- an indication in DCI;

\- the Random Access procedure as specified in clause 5.1.1.

If the MAC entity receives a UL grant indicating an SUL switch while a
Random Access procedure is ongoing, the MAC entity shall ignore the UL
grant.

The Serving Cell configured with *supplementaryUplink* belongs to a
single TAG.

ul\_carrier\_id

where s\_id is the index of the first OFDM symbol of the PRACH occasion
(0 ≤ s\_id \< 14), t\_id is the index of the first slot of the PRACH
occasion in a system frame (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), f\_id is the index of the
PRACH occasion in the frequency domain (0 ≤ f\_id \< 8), and
ul\_carrier\_id is the UL carrier used for Random Access Preamble
transmission (0 for NUL carrier, and 1 for SUL carrier).

5\> if the Serving Cell for the Random Access procedure is SRS-only
SCell:

6\> ignore the received UL grant.

5\> else:

6\> process the received UL grant value and indicate it to the lower
layers.

4\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

5\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed.

1\> when a Timing Advance Command MAC CE is received, and if an N~TA~
(as defined in TS 38.211 \[8\]) has been maintained with the indicated
TAG:

2\> apply the Timing Advance Command for the indicated TAG;

2\> start or restart the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the
indicated TAG.

1\> when a Timing Advance Command is received in a Random Access
Response message for a Serving Cell belonging to a TAG:

2\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble:

3\> apply the Timing Advance Command for this TAG;

3\> start or restart the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with this TAG.

2\> else if the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with this TAG is not
running:

3\> apply the Timing Advance Command for this TAG;

3\> start the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with this TAG;

3\> when the Contention Resolution is considered not successful as
described in subclause 5.1.5; or

feedback for MAC PDU including UE Contention Resolution Identity MAC CE:

4\> stop *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with this TAG.

2\> else:

3\> ignore the received Timing Advance Command.

1\> when a *timeAlignmentTimer* expires:

2\> if the *timeAlignmentTimer* is associated with the PTAG:

3\> notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells, if configured;

3\> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells, if configured;

3\> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink
grants;

> 3\> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;

3\> consider all running *timeAlignmentTimer*s as expired;

3\> maintain N~TA~ (defined in TS 38.211 \[8\]) of all TAGs.

2\> else if the *timeAlignmentTimer* is associated with an STAG, then
for all Serving Cells belonging to this TAG:

3\> flush all HARQ buffers;

3\> notify RRC to release PUCCH, if configured;

3\> notify RRC to release SRS, if configured;

3\> clear any configured downlink assignments and configured uplink
grants;

> 3\> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting;

3\> maintain N~TA~ (defined in TS 38.211 \[8\]) of this TAG.

When the MAC entity stops uplink transmissions for an SCell due to the
fact that the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs
of the MAC entity or the maximum uplink transmission timing difference
between TAGs of any MAC entity of the UE is exceeded, the MAC entity
considers the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the SCell as expired.

The MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission on a Serving
Cell except the Random Access Preamble transmission when the
*timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the TAG to which this Serving Cell
belongs is not running. Furthermore, when the *timeAlignmentTimer*
associated with the PTAG is not running, the MAC entity shall not
perform any uplink transmission on any Serving Cell except the Random
Access Preamble transmission on the SpCell.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.3.2\]

The C-RNTI MAC CE is identified by MAC PDU subheader with LCID as
specified in Table 6.2.1-2.

It has a fixed size and consists of a single field defined as follows
(Figure 6.1.3.2-1):

\- C-RNTI: This field contains the C-RNTI of the MAC entity. The length
of the field is 16 bits.

Figure 6.1.3.2-1: C-RNTI MAC CE

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.5\]

A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs and optionally padding.
Each MAC subPDU consists one of the following:

\- a MAC subheader with Backoff Indicator only;

\- a MAC subheader with RAPID only (i.e. acknowledgment for SI request);

\- a MAC subheader with RAPID and MAC RAR.

A MAC subheader with Backoff Indicator consists of five header fields
E/T/R/R/BI as described in Figure 6.1.5-1. A MAC subPDU with Backoff
Indicator only is placed at the beginning of the MAC PDU, if included.
\'MAC subPDU(s) with RAPID only\' and \'MAC subPDU(s) with RAPID and MAC
RAR\' can be placed anywhere between MAC subPDU with Backoff Indicator
only (if any) and padding (if any).

A MAC subheader with RAPID consists of three header fields E/T/RAPID as
described in Figure 6.1.5-2.

Padding is placed at the end of the MAC PDU if present. Presence and
length of padding is implicit based on TB size, size of MAC subPDU(s).

Figure 6.1.5-1: E/T/R/R/BI MAC subheader

Figure 6.1.5-2: E/T/RAPID MAC subheader

Figure 6.1.5-3: Example of MAC PDU consisting of MAC RARs

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.2.3\]

The MAC RAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3-1, and consists
of the following fields:

\- R: Reserved bit, set to \"0\";

\- Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates
the index value *T~A~* used to control the amount of timing adjustment
that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the
Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits;

\- UL Grant: The Uplink Grant field indicates the resources to be used
on the uplink in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the UL Grant field is 27
bits;

\- Temporary C-RNTI: The Temporary C-RNTI field indicates the temporary
identity that is used by the MAC entity during Random Access. The size
of the Temporary C-RNTI field is 16 bits.

The MAC RAR is octet aligned.

2\> if contention-free Random Access Resources for 2-step RA type have
not been configured and if Random Access Preambles group has not yet
been selected during the current Random Access procedure:

3\> if Random Access Preambles group B for 2-step RA type is configured:

4\> if the potential MSGA payload size (UL data available for
transmission plus MAC subheader and, where required, MAC CEs) is greater
than the *ra-MsgA-SizeGroupA* and the pathloss is less than *PCMAX* (of
the Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure) --
*msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower* -- *msgA-DeltaPreamble* --
*messagePowerOffsetGroupB*; or

4\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for the CCCH logical
channel and the CCCH SDU size plus MAC subheader is greater than
*ra-MsgA-SizeGroupA*:

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group B.

4\> else:

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

3\> else:

4\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

2\> else if contention-free Random Access Resources for 2-step RA type
have been configured and if Random Access Preambles group has not yet
been selected during the current Random Access procedure:

3\> if Random Access Preambles group B for 2-step RA type is configured;
and

3\> if the transport block size of the MSGA payload configured in the
*rach-ConfigDedicated* corresponds to the transport block size of the
MSGA payload associated with Random Access Preambles group B:

4\> select the Random Access Preambles group B.

3\> else:

4\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

2\> else (i.e. Random Access preambles group has been selected during
the current Random Access procedure):

3\> select the same group of Random Access Preambles as was used for the
Random Access Preamble transmission attempt corresponding to the earlier
transmission of MSGA.

2\> select a Random Access Preamble randomly with equal probability from
the 2-step RA type Random Access Preambles associated with the selected
SSB and the selected Random Access Preambles group;

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to the selected Random Access Preamble.

1\> determine the next available PRACH occasion from the PRACH occasions
corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by
the *msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex* if configured and
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* *if configured* (the MAC entity shall select
a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability among the consecutive
PRACH occasions allocated for 2-step RA type according to clause 8.1 of
TS 38.213 \[6\], corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may
take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when
determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to the
selected SSB);

1\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

2\> select a PUSCH occasion from the PUSCH occasions configured in
*msgA-CFRA-PUSCH* corresponding to the PRACH slot of the selected PRACH
occasion, according to *msgA-PUSCH-resource-Index* corresponding to the
selected SSB;

2\> determine the UL grant and the associated HARQ information for the
MSGA payload in the selected PUSCH occasion;

2\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> else:

2\> select a PUSCH occasion corresponding to the selected preamble and
PRACH occasion according to clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\];

2\> determine the UL grant for the MSGA payload according to the PUSCH
configuration associated with the selected Random Access Preambles group
and determine the associated HARQ information;

2\> if the selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid
PUSCH occasion as specified in clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\]:

3\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> perform the MSGA transmission procedure (see clause 5.1.3a).

NOTE: To determine if there is an SSB with *SS-RSRP* above
*msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB*, the UE uses the latest unfiltered *L1-RSRP*
measurement.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3a\]

The MAC entity shall, for each MSGA:

1\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* is greater than one; and

1\> if the notification of suspending power ramping counter has not been
received from lower layers; and

1\> if LBT failure indication was not received from lower layers for the
last MSGA Random Access Preamble transmission; and

1\> if SSB selected is not changed from the selection in the last Random
Access Preamble transmission:

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* by 1.

1\> select the value of *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* according to clause 7.3;

1\> set *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER* to
*msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower* + *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* +
(*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*;

1\> if this is the first MSGA transmission within this Random Access
procedure:

2\> if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel:

3\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a C-RNTI
MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

2\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure
recovery and *spCell-BFR-CBRA* with value *true* is configured:

3\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a BFR
MAC CE or a Truncated BFR MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

2\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly
entity according to the HARQ information determined for the MSGA payload
(see clause 5.1.2a) and store it in the MSGA buffer.

1\> compute the MSGB-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which
the Random Access Preamble is transmitted;

1\> instruct the physical layer to transmit the MSGA using the selected
PRACH occasion and the associated PUSCH resource of MSGA (if the
selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid PUSCH
occasion), using the corresponding RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI,
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX*, *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER,
msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower,* and the amount of power ramping
applied to the latest MSGA preamble transmission (i.e.
(*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*);

a PRACH occasion randomly with equal probability among the consecutive
PRACH occasions allocated for 2-step RA type according to clause 8.1 of

3\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> perform the MSGA transmission procedure (see clause 5.1.3a).

measurement.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3a\]

The MAC entity shall, for each MSGA:

1\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* is greater than one; and

1\> if the notification of suspending power ramping counter has not been
received from lower layers; and

procedure:

2\> if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel:

3\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a C-RNTI
MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

2\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure
recovery and *spCell-BFR-CBRA* with value *true* is configured:

3\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a BFR
MAC CE or a Truncated BFR MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

2\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly
entity according to the HARQ information determined for the MSGA payload
(see clause 5.1.2a) and store it in the MSGA buffer.

1\> compute the MSGB-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which
the Random Access Preamble is transmitted;

1\> instruct the physical layer to transmit the MSGA using the selected
PRACH occasion and the associated PUSCH resource of MSGA (if the
selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid PUSCH
occasion), using the corresponding RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI,
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX*, *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER,
msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower,* and the amount of power ramping
applied to the latest MSGA preamble transmission (i.e.
(*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*);

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4a\]

Once the MSGA preamble is transmitted, regardless of the possible
occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

identified by MSGB-RNTI while the *msgB-ResponseWindow* is running;

1\> if C-RNTI MAC CE was included in the MSGA:

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response
identified by the C-RNTI while the *msgB-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission of the SpCell
is received from lower layers:

2\> if the C-RNTI MAC CE was included in MSGA:

3\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure
recovery (as specified in clause 5.17) and the PDCCH transmission is
addressed to the C-RNTI:

4\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful;

4\> stop the *msgB-ResponseWindow*;

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed.

3\> else if the *timeAlignmentTimer* associated with the PTAG is
running:

4\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to value of the BI field of the MAC
subPDU using Table 7.2-1, multiplied with *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI*.

3\> else:

4\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to 0 ms.

3\> if the MSGB contains a fallbackRAR MAC subPDU; and

3\> if the Random Access Preamble identifier in the MAC subPDU matches
the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* (see clause 5.1.3a):

4\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful;

4\> apply the following actions for the SpCell:

5\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see clause 5.2);

5\> indicate the *msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower* and the amount of
power ramping applied to the latest Random Access Preamble transmission
to lower layers (i.e. (*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*);

5\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

6\> consider the Random Access procedure successfully completed;

6\> process the received UL grant value and indicate it to the lower
layers.

5\> else:

6\> set the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI* to the value received in the Random
Access Response;

6\> if the Msg3 buffer is empty:

> 7\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the MSGA buffer and store it
> in the Msg3 buffer;

6\> process the received UL grant value and indicate it to the lower
layers and proceed with Msg3 transmission.

NOTE: If within a 2-step RA type procedure, an uplink grant provided in
the fallback RAR has a different size than the MSGA payload, the UE
behaviour is not defined.

3\> else if the MSGB contains a successRAR MAC subPDU; and

3\> if the CCCH SDU was included in the MSGA and the UE Contention
Resolution Identity in the MAC subPDU matches the CCCH SDU:

4\> stop *msgB-ResponseWindow*;

4\> if this Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request:

5\> indicate the reception of an acknowledgement for SI request to upper
layers.

4\> else:

5\> set the C-RNTI to the value received in the *successRAR;*

5\> apply the following actions for the SpCell:

6\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see clause 5.2);

4\> deliver the *TPC*, *PUCCH resource Indicator, ChannelAccess-CPext*
(if indicated), and *HARQ feedback Timing Indicator* received in
successRAR to lower layers.

4\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful;

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed;

4\> finish the disassembly and demultiplexing of the MAC PDU.

1\> if *msgB-ResponseWindow* expires, and the Random Access Response
Reception has not been considered as successful based on descriptions
above:

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* by 1;

2\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTE*R = *preambleTransMax* + 1:

3\> indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers;

3\> if this Random Access procedure was triggered for SI request:

4\> consider this Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

2\> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:

3\> if *msgA-TransMax* is applied (see clause 5.1.1a) and
*PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* = *msgA-TransMax* + 1:

4\> set the *RA\_TYPE* to *4-stepRA*;

4\> perform initialization of variables specific to Random Access type
as specified in clause 5.1.1a;

5\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the MSGA buffer and store it in
the Msg3 buffer;

4\> flush HARQ buffer used for the transmission of MAC PDU in the MSGA
buffer;

4\> discard explicitly signalled contention-free 2-step RA type Random
Access Resources, if any;

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure as specified
in clause 5.1.2.

3\> else:

4\> select a random backoff time according to a uniform distribution
between 0 and the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF*;

4\> if the criteria (as defined in clause 5.1.2a) to select
contention-free Random Access Resources is met during the backoff time:

type Random Access (see clause 5.1.2a).

4\> else:

5\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure for 2-step RA
type Random Access (see clause 5.1.2a) after the backoff time.

Upon receiving a fallbackRAR, the MAC entity may stop
*msgB-ResponseWindow* once the Random Access Response reception is
considered as successful.

(0 ≤ s\_id \< 14), t\_id is the index of the first slot of the PRACH
occasion in a system frame (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), where the subcarrier
spacing to determine t\_id is based on the value of μ specified in
clause 5.3.2 in TS 38.211 \[8\], f\_id is the index of the PRACH
occasion in the frequency domain (0 ≤ f\_id \< 8), and ul\_carrier\_id
is the UL carrier used for Random Access Preamble transmission (0 for
NUL carrier, and 1 for SUL carrier). The RA-RNTI is calculated as
specified in clause 5.1.3.

have been explicitly provided in *rach-ConfigDedicated* and at least one
SSB with SS-RSRP above *msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB* amongst the associated
SSBs is available:

2\> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above *msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB* amongst
the associated SSBs;

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to a *ra-PreambleIndex* corresponding to
the selected SSB.

...

1\> if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity
among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

2\> select a PUSCH occasion from the PUSCH occasions configured in
*msgA-CFRA-PUSCH* corresponding to the PRACH slot of the selected PRACH
occasion, according to *msgA-PUSCH-resource-Index* corresponding to the
selected SSB;

2\> determine the UL grant and the associated HARQ information for the
MSGA payload in the selected PUSCH occasion;

2\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> else:

2\> select a PUSCH occasion corresponding to the selected preamble and
PRACH occasion according to clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\];

2\> determine the UL grant for the MSGA payload according to the PUSCH
configuration associated with the selected Random Access Preambles group
and determine the associated HARQ information;

2\> if the selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid
PUSCH occasion as specified in clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\]:

3\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> perform the MSGA transmission procedure (see clause 5.1.3a).

NOTE: To determine if there is an SSB with *SS-RSRP* above
*msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB*, the UE uses the latest unfiltered *L1-RSRP*
measurement.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3a\]

The MAC entity shall, for each MSGA:

1\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* is greater than one; and

1\> if the notification of suspending power ramping counter has not been
received from lower layers; and

1\> if LBT failure indication was not received from lower layers for the
last MSGA Random Access Preamble transmission; and

1\> if SSB selected is not changed from the selection in the last Random
Access Preamble transmission:

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* by 1.

1\> select the value of *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* according to clause 7.3;

1\> set *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER* to
*msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower* + *DELTA\_PREAMBLE* +
(*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*;

1\> if this is the first MSGA transmission within this Random Access
procedure:

2\> if the transmission is not being made for the CCCH logical channel:

3\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a C-RNTI
MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

2\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure
recovery and *spCell-BFR-CBRA* with value *true* is configured:

3\> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include a BFR
MAC CE or a Truncated BFR MAC CE in the subsequent uplink transmission.

2\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly
entity according to the HARQ information determined for the MSGA payload
(see clause 5.1.2a) and store it in the MSGA buffer.

1\> compute the MSGB-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which
the Random Access Preamble is transmitted;

1\> instruct the physical layer to transmit the MSGA using the selected
PRACH occasion and the associated PUSCH resource of MSGA (if the
selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid PUSCH
occasion), using the corresponding RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI,
*PREAMBLE\_INDEX*, *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER,
msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower,* and the amount of power ramping
applied to the latest MSGA preamble transmission (i.e.
(*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*);

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4a\]

Once the MSGA preamble is transmitted, regardless of the possible
occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

1\> start the *msgB-ResponseWindow* at the PDCCH occasion as specified
in TS 38.213 \[6\], clause 8.2A;

1\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for a Random Access Response
identified by MSGB-RNTI while the *msgB-ResponseWindow* is running;

*...*

3\> else if the MSGB contains a successRAR MAC subPDU; and

3\> if the CCCH SDU was included in the MSGA and the UE Contention
Resolution Identity in the MAC subPDU matches the CCCH SDU:

4\> stop *msgB-ResponseWindow*;

4\> if this Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request:

5\> indicate the reception of an acknowledgement for SI request to upper
layers.

4\> else:

5\> set the C-RNTI to the value received in the *successRAR;*

5\> apply the following actions for the SpCell:

6\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see clause 5.2);

6\> indicate the *msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower* and the amount of
power ramping applied to the latest Random Access Preamble transmission
to lower layers (i.e. (*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_COUNTER* -- 1) ×
*PREAMBLE\_POWER\_RAMPING\_STEP*).

4\> deliver the *TPC*, *PUCCH resource Indicator, ChannelAccess-CPext*
(if indicated), and *HARQ feedback Timing Indicator* received in
successRAR to lower layers.

4\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful;

4\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed;

4\> finish the disassembly and demultiplexing of the MAC PDU.

...

Upon receiving a fallbackRAR, the MAC entity may stop
*msgB-ResponseWindow* once the Random Access Response reception is
considered as successful.

specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.1.1 and 5.1.4a. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause5.1.1\]

The Random Access procedure described in this clause is initiated by a
PDCCH order, by the MAC entity itself, or by RRC for the events in
accordance with TS 38.300 \[2\]. There is only one Random Access
procedure ongoing at any point in time in a MAC entity. The Random
Access procedure on an SCell shall only be initiated by a PDCCH order
with *ra-PreambleIndex* different from 0b000000.

...

1\> if the Random Access procedure is initiated by PDCCH order and if
the *ra-PreambleIndex* explicitly provided by PDCCH is not 0b000000; or

1\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request (as
specified in TS 38.331 \[5\]) and the Random Access Resources for SI
request have been explicitly provided by RRC; or

1\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SpCell beam failure
recovery (as specified in clause 5.17) and if the contention-free Random
Access Resources for beam failure recovery request for 4-step RA type
have been explicitly provided by RRC for the BWP selected for Random
Access procedure; or

1\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for reconfiguration
with sync and if the contention-free Random Access Resources for 4-step
RA type have been explicitly provided in *rach-ConfigDedicated* for the
BWP selected for Random Access procedure:

2\> set the *RA\_TYPE* to *4-stepRA*.

1\> else if the BWP selected for Random Access procedure is configured
with both 2-step and 4-step RA type Random Access Resources and the RSRP
of the downlink pathloss reference is above *msgA-RSRP-Threshold*; or

1\> if the BWP selected for Random Access procedure is only configured
with 2-step RA type Random Access resources (i.e. no 4-step RACH RA type
resources configured); or

1\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for reconfiguration
with sync and if the contention-free Random Access Resources for 2-step
RA type have been explicitly provided in *rach-ConfigDedicated* for the
BWP selected for Random Access procedure:

2\> set the *RA\_TYPE* to *2-stepRA*.

1\> else:

2\> set the *RA\_TYPE* to *4-stepRA*.

1\> perform initialization of variables specific to Random Access type
as specified in clause 5.1.1a;

1\> if *RA\_TYPE* is set to *2-stepRA*:

2\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure for 2-step RA
type (see clause 5.1.2a).

1\> else:

2\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure (see clause
5.1.2).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4a\]

Once the MSGA preamble is transmitted, regardless of the possible
occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

...

1\> if *msgB-ResponseWindow* expires, and the Random Access Response
Reception has not been considered as successful based on descriptions
above:

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* by 1;

2\> if *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTE*R = *preambleTransMax* + 1:

3\> indicate a Random Access problem to upper layers;

3\> if this Random Access procedure was triggered for SI request:

4\> consider this Random Access procedure unsuccessfully completed.

2\> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:

3\> if *msgA-TransMax* is applied (see clause 5.1.1a) and
*PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* = *msgA-TransMax* + 1:

4\> set the *RA\_TYPE* to *4-stepRA*;

4\> perform initialization of variables specific to Random Access type
as specified in clause 5.1.1a;

4\> if the Msg3 buffer is empty:

5\> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the MSGA buffer and store it in
the Msg3 buffer;

4\> flush HARQ buffer used for the transmission of MAC PDU in the MSGA
buffer;

4\> discard explicitly signalled contention-free 2-step RA type Random
Access Resources, if any;

4\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure as specified
in clause 5.1.2.

3\> else:

4\> select a random backoff time according to a uniform distribution
between 0 and the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF*;

4\> if the criteria (as defined in clause 5.1.2a) to select
contention-free Random Access Resources is met during the backoff time:

5\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure for 2-step RA
type Random Access (see clause 5.1.2a).

4\> else:

5\> perform the Random Access Resource selection procedure for 2-step RA
type Random Access (see clause 5.1.2a) after the backoff time.

Upon receiving a fallbackRAR, the MAC entity may stop
*msgB-ResponseWindow* once the Random Access Response reception is
considered as successful.

##### 7.1.1.1.10a.2 Conformance requirements {#a.2-conformance-requirements-2 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: 3GPP TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4a, 5.1.5 and 6.2.3a and TS
38.300, clause 9.2.6. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-16
requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4a\]

Once the MSGA preamble is transmitted, regardless of the possible
occurrence of a measurement gap, the MAC entity shall:

1\> start the *msgB-ResponseWindow* at the PDCCH occasion as specified
in TS 38.213 \[6\], clause 8.2A;

1\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for a Random Access Response
identified by MSGB-RNTI while the *msgB-ResponseWindow* is running;

1\> if C-RNTI MAC CE was included in the MSGA:

2\> monitor the PDCCH of the SpCell for Random Access Response
identified by the C-RNTI while the *msgB-ResponseWindow* is running.

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission of the SpCell
is received from lower layers:

...

2\> if a valid (as specified in TS 38.213 \[6\]) downlink assignment has
been received on the PDCCH for the MSGB-RNTI and the received TB is
successfully decoded:

3\> if the MSGB contains a MAC subPDU with Backoff Indicator:

4\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to value of the BI field of the MAC
subPDU using Table 7.2-1, multiplied with *SCALING\_FACTOR\_BI*.

3\> else:

4\> set the *PREAMBLE\_BACKOFF* to 0 ms.

3\> if the MSGB contains a fallbackRAR MAC subPDU; and

3\> if the Random Access Preamble identifier in the MAC subPDU matches
the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* (see clause 5.1.3a):

4\> consider this Random Access Response reception successful;

4\> apply the following actions for the SpCell:

5\> process the received Timing Advance Command (see clause 5.2);

5\> indicate the *msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower* and the amount of
power ramping applied to the latest Random Access Preamble transmission

The fallbackRAR is of fixed size as depicted in Figure 6.2.3a-1, and
consists of the following fields:

\- R: Reserved bit, set to 0;

\- Timing Advance Command: The Timing Advance Command field indicates
the index value *T~A~* used to control the amount of timing adjustment
that the MAC entity has to apply in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the
Timing Advance Command field is 12 bits;

\- UL Grant: The Uplink Grant field indicates the resources to be used
on the uplink in TS 38.213 \[6\]. The size of the UL Grant field is 27
bits;

\- Temporary C-RNTI: The Temporary C-RNTI field indicates the temporary
identity that is used by the MAC entity during Random Access. The size
of the Temporary C-RNTI field is 16 bits.

The fallbackRAR is octet aligned.

\[TS 38.300, clause 9.2.6\]

The MSGA of the 2-step RA type includes a preamble on PRACH and a
payload on PUSCH. After MSGA transmission, the UE monitors for a
response from the network within a configured window. For CFRA,
dedicated preamble and PUSCH resource are configured for MSGA
transmission and upon receiving the network response, the UE ends the
random access procedure as shown in Figure 9.2.6-1(d). For CBRA, if
contention resolution is successful upon receiving the network response,
the UE ends the random access procedure as shown in Figure 9.2.6-1(b);
while if fallback indication is received in MSGB, the UE performs MSG3
transmission using the UL grant scheduled in the fallback indication and
monitors contention resolution as shown in Figure 9.2.6-2. If contention
resolution is not successful after MSG3 (re)transmission(s), the UE goes
back to MSGA transmission.

selected carrier; and

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1c\]

The MAC entity shall for each set of configured Random Access resources
for 4-step RA type and for each set of configured Random Access
resources for 2-step RA type:

1\> if RedCap indication is configured for a set of Random Access
resources:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources as not available for a
Random Access procedure for which RedCap indication is not applicable.

1\> if SDT indication is configured for a set of Random Access
resources:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources as not available for the
Random Access procedure which is not triggered for SDT.

1\> if NSAG indication is configured for a set of Random Access
resources:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources as not available for the
Random Access procedure unless it is triggered for the corresponding
NSAG indication.

1\> if MSG3 repetition indication is configured for a set of Random
Access resources:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources as not available for the
Random Access procedure if MSG3 repetition is not applicable.

1\> if a set of Random Access resources is not configured with any of
the RedCap or SDT or NSAG(s) or MSG3 repetition indications:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources to not associated with
any feature indication.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1d\]

The MAC entity shall:

1\> among the available sets of Random Access resources for this Random
Access procedure (as specified in clause 5.1.1c), identify those
configured with a feature which has the highest priority assigned in
*featurePriorities* among all the features applicable to this Random
Access procedure as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\].

1\> if a single set of Random Access resources is identified:

2\> select this set of Random Access resources.

1\> else if more than one set of Random Access resources is identified:

2\> repeat the procedure taking as an input the identified sets of
Random Access resources and the feature applicable to the current Random
Access procedure with the highest priority assigned in
*featurePriorities* among all the features applicable to this Random
Access procedure, except the features considered already.

1\> else (i.e. no set of Random Access resources is identified):

2\> repeat the procedure taking as an input the previous identified
available sets of Random Access resources and the feature applicable to
the current Random Access procedure with the highest priority assigned
in *featurePriorities* among all the features applicable to this Random
Access procedure, except the features considered already.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.2\]

If the selected *RA\_TYPE* is set to *4-stepRA*, the MAC entity shall:

...

1\> else (i.e. for the contention-based Random Access preamble
selection):

2\> if at least one of the SSBs with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*
is available:

3\> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*.

2\> else:

3\> select any SSB.

2\> if the *RA\_TYPE* is switched from *2-stepRA* to *4-stepRA*:

4\> else:

5\> select the Random Access Preambles group A.

2\> else if Msg3 buffer is empty:

3\> if Random Access Preambles group B is configured:

4\> if the potential Msg3 size (UL data available for transmission plus
MAC subheader(s) and, where required, MAC CEs) is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA* and the pathloss is less than *PCMAX* (of the
Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure) --
*preambleReceivedTargetPower* -- *msg3-DeltaPreamble* --
*messagePowerOffsetGroupB*; or

4\> if the Random Access procedure was initiated for the CCCH logical
channel and the CCCH SDU size plus MAC subheader is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA*:

Random Access Preamble transmission attempt corresponding to the first
transmission of Msg3.

2\> select a Random Access Preamble randomly with equal probability from
the Random Access Preambles associated with the selected SSB and the
selected Random Access Preambles group;

available sets of Random Access resources and the feature applicable to
the current Random Access procedure with the highest priority assigned
in *featurePriorities* among all the features applicable to this Random
Access procedure, except the features considered already.

MAC subheader(s) and, where required, MAC CEs) is greater than
*ra-Msg3SizeGroupA* and the pathloss is less than *PCMAX* (of the
Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure) --
*preambleReceivedTargetPower* -- *msg3-DeltaPreamble* --
*messagePowerOffsetGroupB*; or

the Serving Cell performing the Random Access Procedure) --
*msgA-PreambleReceivedTargetPower* -- *msgA-DeltaPreamble* --

Random Access Preamble transmission attempt corresponding to the earlier
transmission of MSGA.

corresponding to the selected SSB permitted by the restrictions given by
the *msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex* if configured, or
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* *if configured,* or *ssb-SharedRO-MaskIndex*
if configured (the MAC entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly
with equal probability among the consecutive PRACH occasions allocated
for 2-step RA type according to clause 8.1 of TS 38.213 \[6\] regardless
the FR2 UL gap, corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may
take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps and MUSIM
gaps when determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to
the selected SSB);

among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

2\> select a PUSCH occasion from the PUSCH occasions configured in
*msgA-CFRA-PUSCH* corresponding to the PRACH slot of the selected PRACH
occasion, according to *msgA-PUSCH-Resource-Index* corresponding to the
selected SSB;

MSGA payload in the selected PUSCH occasion;

2\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> else:

2\> select a PUSCH occasion corresponding to the selected preamble and
PRACH occasion according to clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\];

2\> determine the UL grant for the MSGA payload according to the PUSCH
configuration associated with the selected Random Access Preambles group
and determine the associated HARQ information;

2\> if the selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid
PUSCH occasion as specified in clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\]:

3\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> perform the MSGA transmission procedure (see clause 5.1.3a).

NOTE 1: To determine if there is an SSB with *SS-RSRP* above
*msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB*, the UE uses the latest unfiltered *L1-RSRP*
measurement.

NOTE 2: If a RedCap UE in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE mode is configured
with a BWP indicated by *initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap* which is not
associated with any SSB, SS-RSRP measurement is performed based on the
SSB associated with the BWP indicated by *initialDownlinkBWP*.

if configured (the MAC entity shall select a PRACH occasion randomly
with equal probability among the consecutive PRACH occasions allocated
for 2-step RA type according to clause 8.1 of TS 38.213 \[6\] regardless
the FR2 UL gap, corresponding to the selected SSB; the MAC entity may
take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps and MUSIM
gaps when determining the next available PRACH occasion corresponding to
the selected SSB);

among the contention-based Random Access Preamble(s):

2\> select a PUSCH occasion from the PUSCH occasions configured in
*msgA-CFRA-PUSCH* corresponding to the PRACH slot of the selected PRACH
occasion, according to *msgA-PUSCH-Resource-Index* corresponding to the

MSGA payload in the selected PUSCH occasion;

2\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> else:

2\> select a PUSCH occasion corresponding to the selected preamble and
PRACH occasion according to clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\];

2\> determine the UL grant for the MSGA payload according to the PUSCH
configuration associated with the selected Random Access Preambles group
and determine the associated HARQ information;

2\> if the selected preamble and PRACH occasion is mapped to a valid
PUSCH occasion as specified in clause 8.1A of TS 38.213 \[6\]:

3\> deliver the UL grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.

1\> perform the MSGA transmission procedure (see clause 5.1.3a).

NOTE 1: To determine if there is an SSB with *SS-RSRP* above
*msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB*, the UE uses the latest unfiltered *L1-RSRP*
measurement.

NOTE 2: If a RedCap UE in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE mode is configured
with a BWP indicated by *initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap* which is not
associated with any SSB, SS-RSRP measurement is performed based on the
SSB associated with the BWP indicated by *initialDownlinkBWP*.

##### 7.1.1.1.15.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-14 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.1.1 and 5.1.2, TS38.331,
clauses 5.2.2.3.3 and 6.3.2. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17
requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1\]

\- *ra-PreambleStartIndex*: the starting index of Random Access
Preamble(s) for on-demand SI request;

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.2\]

If the selected *RA\_TYPE* is set to *4-stepRA*, the MAC entity shall:

...

1\> else if the Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request (as
specified in TS 38.331 \[5\]); and

1\> if the Random Access Resources for SI request have been explicitly
provided by RRC:

2\> if at least one of the SSBs with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*
is available:

3\> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above *rsrp-ThresholdSSB*.

2\> else:

3\> select any SSB.

2\> select a Random Access Preamble corresponding to the selected SSB,
from the Random Access Preamble(s) determined according to
*ra-PreambleStartIndex* as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\];

2\> set the *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* to selected Random Access Preamble.

\[TS 38.331, clause 5.2.2.3.3\]

The UE shall, while SDT procedure is not ongoing:

...

1\> else if the UE is a RedCap UE and if ***initialUplinkBWP-RedCap***
is configured in *UplinkConfigCommonSIB* and if *SIB1* includes
*si-SchedulingInfo* containing *si-RequestConfigRedCap* and criteria to
select normal uplink as defined in TS 38.321\[3\], clause 5.1.1 is met:

2\> trigger the lower layer to initiate the Random Access procedure on
normal uplink in accordance with TS 38.321 \[3\] using the PRACH
preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in *si-RequestConfigRedcap*
corresponding to the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate
within the cell, and for which *si-BroadcastStatus* is set to
*notBroadcasting*;

2\> if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:

3\> acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2,
immediately;

1\> else:

2\> if the UE is not a RedCap UE and if *SIB1* includes
*si-SchedulingInfo* containing *si-RequestConfig* and criteria to select
normal uplink as defined in TS 38.321\[3\], clause 5.1.1 is met; or

2\> if the UE is a RedCap UE and if ***initialUplinkBWP-RedCap*** is not
configured in *UplinkConfigCommonSIB* and if *SIB1* includes
*si-SchedulingInfo* containing *si-RequestConfig* and criteria to select
normal uplink as defined in TS 38.321\[3\], clause 5.1.1 is met:

3\> trigger the lower layer to initiate the Random Access procedure on
normal uplink in accordance with TS 38.321 \[3\] using the PRACH
preamble(s) and PRACH resource(s) in *si-RequestConfig* corresponding to
the SI message(s) that the UE requires to operate within the cell, and
for which *si-BroadcastStatus* is set to *notBroadcasting*;

3\> if acknowledgement for SI request is received from lower layers:

4\> acquire the requested SI message(s) as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2,
immediately;

\[TS 38.331, clause 6.3.2\]

***si-RequestConfigRedCap***

Configuration of Msg1 resources for ***initialUplinkBWP-RedCap*** that
the ***RedCap*** UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which
*si-BroadcastStatus* is set to *notBroadcasting*.

##### 7.1.1.1.17.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-16 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.1.1, 5.1.1b, 5.1.1c ,5.1.1d
and 6.2.1, TS38.300, clauses 16.13.3. Unless otherwise stated these are
Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1\]

...

When a Random Access procedure is initiated, UE selects a set of Random
Access resources as specified in clause 5.1.1b and initialises the
following parameters for the Random Access procedure according to the
values configured by RRC for the selected set of Random Access
resources:

...

*- featurePriorities*: priorities for features, such as REDCAP, Slice
group(s), etc. (see clause 5.1.1d);

...

\- *startPreambleForThisPartition*: the ***first preamble associated
with the set of Random Access Resources applicable to the Random Access
procedure***;

...

\- *numberOfPreamblesForThisPartition*: the ***number of consequtive
preambles associated with the set of Random Access Resources applicable
to the Random Access procedure***;

...

When the Random Access procedure is initiated on a Serving Cell, the MAC
entity shall:

...

1\> perform the BWP operation as specified in clause 5.15;

1\> select the set of Random Access resources applicable to the current
Random Access procedure according to clause 5.1.1b;

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1b\]

The MAC entity shall:

...

1\> if contention-free Random Access Resources have not been provided
for this Random Access procedure and one or more of the features
including REDCAP and/or a specific slice group(s) and/or SDT and/or MSG3
repetition is applicable for this Random Access procedure:

Editor\'s Note: FFS if some clarification is needed on how feature
applicability is known (e.g. from RRC etc)

2\> if none of the sets of Random Access resources are available for the
current Random Access procedure (as specified in clause 5.1.1c):

3\> select the set of Random Access resources that are not associated
with any feature indication (as specified in clause 5.1.1c) for this
Random Access procedure.

2\> else if there are one or more set(s) of Random Access resources
available (as specified in clause 5.1.1c) and one of these set(s) of
Random Access resources can be used for indicating all features
triggering this Random Access procedure:

3\> select the available set of Random Access resources for this Random
Access procedure.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1c\]

The MAC entity shall for each set of configured Random Access resources
for 4-step RA type and for each set of configured Random Access
resources for 2-step RA type:

1\> if REDCAP indication is configured for a set of Random Access
resources:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources as not available for a
RACH procedure for which REDCAP indication is not applicable.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1d\]

The MAC entity shall:

1\> among the available sets of Random Access resources, identify those
configured with a feature which has the highest priority assigned in
*featurePriorities* among all the features applicable to this Random
Access procedure as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\].

1\> if a single set of Random Access resources is identified:

2\> select this set of Random Access resources.

...

\[TS 38.300, clause 16.13.3\]

A RedCap UE can be identified by the network during Random Access
procedure via MSG3/MSGA from a RedCap specific LCID(s) and optionally
via MSG1/MSGA (PRACH occasion or PRACH preamble). For RedCap UE
identification via MSG1/MSGA, RedCap specific Random Access
configuration may be configured by the network. For MSG3/MSGA, a RedCap
UE is identified by the dedicated LCID(s) indicated for CCCH
identification (CCCH or CCCH1) regardless whether RedCap specific Random
Access configuration is configured by the network.

##### 7.1.1.1.18.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-17 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.213 clause 8.1, 8.3, TS 38.214 clause
6.1.2.1, TS 38.300, clause 19, and TS 38.321 clause 5.1.1b. Unless
otherwise stated these are Rel-17 requirements.

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.1\]

For a random access procedure associated with a feature combination
indicated by *FeatureCombinationPreambles*, a UE is provided a number
$N$ of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by
*ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB* or
*msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB when provided* and a
number $S$ of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per
valid PRACH occasion by *startPreambleForThisPartition* and
*numberOfPreamblesPerSSB-ForThisPartition*. The PRACH transmission can
be on a subset of PRACH occasions associated with a same SS/PBCH block
index within an SSB-RO mapping cycle for a UE provided with a PRACH mask
index by *ssb-SharedRO-MaskIndex* according to \[11, TS 38.321\].

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.3\]

A UE can be provided in *BWP-UplinkCommon* a set of numbers of
repetitions for a PUSCH transmission with PUSCH repetition Type A that
is scheduled by a RAR UL grant or by a DCI format 0\_0 with CRC
scrambled by a TC-RNTI. If the UE requests repetitions for the PUSCH
transmission \[11, TS 38.321\], the UE transmits the PUSCH over
$N_{\text{PUSCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots, where
$N_{\text{PUSCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ is indicated by the 2 MSBs of the MCS
field in the RAR UL grant or in the DCI format 0\_0 from a set of four
values provided by *numberOfMsg3-RepetitionsList* or from {1, 2, 3, 4}
if *numberOfMsg3-RepetitionsList* is not provided. The UE determines an
MCS for the PUSCH transmission by the 2 LSBs of the MCS field in the RAR
UL grant or by the 3 LSBs of the MCS field in the DCI format 0\_0, and
determines a redundancy version and RBs for each repetition as described
in \[6, TS 38.214\]. For unpaired spectrum operation, the UE determines
the $N_{\text{PUSCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots as the first
$N_{\text{PUSCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots starting from slot
$n + k_{2} + \mathrm{\Delta}$ where a repetition of the PUSCH
transmission does not include a symbol indicated as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or indicated as a symbol of an SS/PBCH
block with index provided by *ssb-PositionsInBurst.*

\[TS 38.214 clause 6.1.2.1\]

For PUSCH repetition type A, when transmitting PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL
grant, the 2 MSBs of the MCS information field of the RAR UL grant
provide a codepoint to determine the number of repetitions *K* according
to Table 6.1.2.1-1A, based on whether or not the higher layer parameter
*numberOfMsg3-RepetitionsList* is configured. The number of slots used
for TBS determination N is equal to 1.

For PUSCH repetition type A, when transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI
format 0\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the 2 MSBs of the MCS
information field of the DCI format 0\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI
provide a codepoint to determine the number of repetitions *K* according
to Table 6.1.2.1-1A, based on whether or not the higher layer parameter
*numberOfMsg3-RepetitionsList* is configured. The number of slots used
for TBS determination N is equal to 1.

\[TS 38.300, clause 19\]

To improve NR uplink coverage for both FR1 and FR2, the following
enhancements on PUSCH, PUCCH and MSG3 PUSCH are supported:

\- ...

\- Aggregation of multiple slots with TB repetition for MSG3
transmission is supported on both NUL and SUL, applicable to CBRA with
4-step RA type. If configured, the UE requests MSG3 repetition via
separate RACH resources when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference is lower
than a configured threshold. BWP configured with RACH resources solely
for MSG3 repetition is also supported without the need to consider the
RSRP of DL path-loss reference by the UE.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1b\]

The MAC entity shall:

1\> if the BWP selected for Random Access procedure is configured with
both set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition indication
and set(s) of Random Access resources without MSG3 repetition indication
and the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than
*rsrp-ThresholdMsg3*; or

1\> if the BWP selected for Random Access procedure is only configured
with the set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition
indication;

2\> assume MSG3 repetition is applicable for the current Random Access
procedure.

1\> else:

2\> assume MSG3 repetition is not applicable for the current Random
Access procedure.

NOTE 1: Void.

1\> if contention-free Random Access Resources have not been provided
for this Random Access procedure and one or more of the features
including RedCap and/or a specific NSAG(s) and/or SDT and/or MSG3
repetition is applicable for this Random Access procedure:

NOTE 2: The applicability of SDT is determined by MAC entity according
to clause 5.27. The applicability of specific slice group(s) is
determined by upper layers when the Random Access procedure is initiated
by the upper layers. The applicability of RedCap is also determined by
upper layers when Random Access procedure is initiated and it is
applicable to the Random Access procedures initiated by PDCCH orders and
any Random Access procedure initiated by the MAC entity.

2\> if none of the sets of Random Access resources are available for any
feature applicable to the current Random Access procedure (as specified
in clause 5.1.1c):

3\> select the set(s) of Random Access resources that are not associated
with any feature indication (as specified in clause 5.1.1c) for this
Random Access procedure.

2\> else if there is one set of Random Access resources available which
can be used for indicating all features triggering this Random Access
procedure:

3\> select this set of Random Access resources for this Random Access
procedure.

2\> else (i.e. there are one or more sets of Random Access resources
available that are configured with indication(s) for a subset of all
features triggering this Random Access procedure):

> 3\> select a set of Random Access resources from the available set(s)
> of Random Access resources based on the priority order indicated by
> upper layers as specified in clause 5.1.1d for this Random Access
> Procedure.

1\> else if contention-free Random Access Resources have been provided
for this Random Access procedure and RedCap is applicable for the
current Random Access procedure and there is one set of Random Access
resources available that is only configured with RedCap indication:

2\> select this set of Random Access resources for this Random Access
procedure.

1\> else:

2\> select the set of Random Access resources that are not associated
with any feature indication (as specified in clause 5.1.1c) for the
current Random Access procedure.

##### 7.1.1.1.19.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-18 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.213 clause 6, TS 38.321, clause 5.1.2,
5.1.3, 5.1.4 and 5.17. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17
requirements.

\[TS 38.213, clause 6\]

For the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a
link to a search space set provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId,* as
described in clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE
is provided *recoverySearchSpaceId*, the UE does not expect to be
provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET
associated with the search space set provided by
*recoverySearchSpaceId*.

For the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by
*PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR*, a configuration for PRACH transmission as
described in clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot $n$ and
according to antenna port quasi co-location parameters associated with
periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or with SS/PBCH block associated
with index $q_{\text{new}}$ *provided by higher layers* \[11, TS
38.321\], the UE monitors PDCCH in a search space set provided by
*recoverySearchSpaceId* for detection of a DCI format with CRC scrambled
by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from slot
$n + 4 + {2^{\mu} \bullet k}_{\text{mac}}$, where $\mu$ is the SCS
configuration for the PRACH transmission and $k_{\text{mac}}$ is a
number of slots provided by *kmac* \[12, TS 38.331\] or
$k_{\text{mac}} = 0$ if *kmac* is not provided, within a window
configured by *BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring* in a
search space set provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId* *and for
corresponding PDSCH receptions, the UE assumes the same antenna port
quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with* index
$q_{\text{new}}$ *until the UE receives by higher layers an activation
for a TCI state or any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList
and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.* After the UE detects a DCI format
with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set
provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId*, the UE continues to monitor PDCCH
candidates in the search space set provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId*
until the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or
*tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.*

*For the PCell or the PSCell, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of* a
first PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by
*recoverySearchSpaceId* for which the UE detects a DCI format with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI *and* until the UE receives an
activation command for *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* \[11, TS 38.321\] or
is provided *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* for PUCCH resource(s), t*he UE
transmits a PUCCH on a same cell as the PRACH transmission using*

\[TS 38.214, clause 6.2.1\]

The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal
(SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter
*SRS-ResourceSet* or *SRS-PosResourceSet*. For each SRS resource set
configured by *SRS-ResourceSet*, a UE may be configured with SRS
resources (higher layer parameter *SRS-Resource*), where the maximum
value of K is indicated by UE capability \[13, 38.306\]. When SRS
resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter
*SRS-PosResourceSet,* a UE may be configured with *K* ≥1 SRS resources
(higher layer parameter *SRS-PosResource*), where the maximum value of K
is 16. The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher
layer parameter *usage* in *SRS-ResourceSet.* When the higher layer
parameter *usage* is set to \'beamManagement\'*,* only one SRS resource
in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time
instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the
same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted
simultaneously.

During non-active periods of cell DRX, the UE configured with cell DRX
is not expected to transmit the periodic SRS, or semi-persistent SRS for
channel acquisition. SRS for positioning is not impacted by cell DRX
operation.

For the SRS resource set(s) configured *in
srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2* with higher layer parameter *usage*
set to \'*antennaSwitching*\' or \'*beamManagement*\', the UE expects
the same SRS resource set(s) with the same *usage* being configured in
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModList.*

When the UE is configured *dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* or
*ul-TCI-StateList,* the UE can assume that SRS resource(s) in any SRS
resource set, except SRS resource set for positioning and an SRS
resource set configured with *followUnifiedTCI-StateSRS*, can be
configured with *TCI-State* or *TCI-UL-State* or updated as described in
clause 6.1.3.59 or 6.1.3.60 of \[10, TS 38.321\]. The reference RS in
the *TCI-State* can be a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition*, or a CSI-RS
resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with higher layer
parameter *trs-Info*. The reference RS in the *TCI-UL-State(s)* can be a
CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with higher
layer parameter *repetition*, a CSI-RS resource in an
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with higher layer parameter
*trs-Info*, an SRS resource with the higher layer parameter *usage* set
to \'beamManagement\', or SS/PBCH block associated with the same or
different PCI from the PCI of the serving cell.

If an SRS resource set, except an SRS resource set for positioning, is
configured with *followUnifiedTCI-StateSRS*, the UE shall transmit the
target SRS resource(s) within the SRS resource set according to the
spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS used for
determining UL TX spatial filter. The RS is determined based on an RS
configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' in *QCL-Info* of the
indicated *TCI-State* or an RS in the indicated *TCI-UL-State*. The
reference RS in the indicated *TCI-State* can be a CSI-RS resource in a
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with higher layer parameter
*repetition*, or a CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info.* The reference RS in
the indicated *TCI-UL-State* can be a CSI-RS resource in a
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with higher layer parameter
*repetition*, a CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info,* an SRS resource with
the higher layer parameter *usage* set to \'beamManagement\', or SS/PBCH
block associated with the same or different PCI from the PCI of the
serving cell.

When the UE is configured *dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* or *TCI-UL-State*
and is having two indicated TCI-States or TCI-UL-States, and if the UE
is configured with \[\[*followUnifiedTCI-StateSRS\]\]* to*,* a periodic,
semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS resource set with higher layer
parameter *usage* in *SRS-ResourceSet* set to '*codebook*',
'*nonCodebook*' or '*antennaSwitching*' or to an aperiodic SRS resource
set with higher layer parameter *usage* in *SRS-ResourceSet* set to
'*beamManagement*'

\- The UE may be configured by higher layer parameter
*applyIndicatedTCIState* to the SRS resource set to indicate whether the
UE shall apply the first or the second indicated *TCI-State* or
*TCI-UL-State* to the SRS resource set.

\- When a UE is configured by higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that
contains two different values of *coresetPoolIndex* in
*ControlResourceSet*, the first and second indicated *TCI-States* or
*TCI-UL-States* correspond to the indicated *TCI-States* or
*TCI-UL-States* specific to *coresetPoolIndex* value 0 and value 1,
respectively.

\- When a UE is configured by higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that
contains two different values of *coresetPoolIndex* in
*ControlResourceSet*, and the aperiodic SRS resource set which is not
configured with higher layer parameter *applyIndicatedTCIState* and the
aperiodic SRS resource set is triggered by PDCCH on a CORESET associated
with a *coresetPoolIndex* value, the UE shall apply the indicated
*TCI-State* or *TCI-UL-State* specific to the *coresetPoolIndex* value
to the aperiodic SRS resource set.

\- When two SRS resource sets with higher layer parameter *usage* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'codebook\' or 'nonCodebook' are configured,
the UE does not expectthat the first indicated *TCI-State* or
*TCI-UL-State* is applied to the second SRS resource set and that the
second indicated *TCI-State* or *TCI-UL-State* is applied to the first
SRS resource set.

For aperiodic SRS at least one state of the DCI field is used to select
at least one out of the configured SRS resource set(s).

##### 7.1.1.1.20.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-19 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.213 clause 8.1, 8.2, TS 38.321 clause
5.1.1b, 5.1.2, 5.1.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-18
requirements.

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.1\]

Physical random access procedure for a UE is triggered upon request of a
PRACH transmission by higher layers or by a PDCCH order or LTM Cell
Switch Command MAC CE in clause 6.1.3.75 \[11, TS 38.321\] for a cell. A
configuration by higher layers for a PRACH transmission includes the
following:

\- A configuration for PRACH transmission on the cell \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- A preamble index, a preamble SCS, $P_{PRACH,target}$, a corresponding
RA-RNTI when applicable \[11, TS 38.321\], and a PRACH resource for the
cell.

\- A number of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}} > 1$ preamble
repetitions for the PRACH transmission if the UE would transmit the
PRACH with repetitions.

A UE transmits a PRACH on a cell using the selected PRACH format with
transmission power $P_{PRACH,b,f,c}(i)$, as described in clause 7.4, on
the indicated PRACH resource or on a determined set of
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ resources using a same spatial filter
in case of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ preamble repetitions.

...

For a PRACH transmission with $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$
preamble repetitions, a set consists of
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ valid PRACH occasions that are
consecutive in time, use same frequency resources, and are associated
with same one or more SS/PBCH block index(es), and each SS/PBCH block
index is associated with same preamble indexes in all valid PRACH
occasions within the set.

For a PRACH transmission with preamble repetitions, a time period,
starting from frame 0, is the smallest integer number of association
pattern periods such that at least one set of valid PRACH occasions for
each of the $N_{\text{Tx}}^{\text{SSB}}$ SS/PBCH block indexes can be
determined within the time period for all configured number of preamble
repetitions. The set(s) of valid PRACH occasions for each configured
number of preamble repetitions repeats every time period.

Within a time period, for set(s) of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$
valid PRACH occasions for a PRACH transmission with
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ preamble repetitions

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid
PRACH occasion

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any, is
determined according to an ordering of valid PRACH occasions

\- first, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for
frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions

\- second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time
multiplexed PRACH occasions

where, for each frequency resource index for frequency multiplexed PRACH
occasions

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid
PRACH occasion

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any,

\- is after *msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* consecutive valid PRACH
occasions in time from the first valid PRACH occasion of the previous
set, where each PRACH occasion is associated with same SS/PBCH block
index(es) and each SS/PBCH block index is associated with same
preambles, if *msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* is provided

\- is after **the** PRACH occasions **for the previous** set, if
*msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* is not provided

...

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.2\]

In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a
window controlled by higher layers \[11, TS 38.321\] if the PRACH
transmission is not triggered by a PDCCH order that includes a Cell
Indicator field with non-zero value; otherwise, the UE does not attempt
to detect the DCI format 1\_0. The window starts at the first symbol of
the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one
symbol, after the last symbol of the last PRACH occasion corresponding
to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the
SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined in clause 10.1. If
$N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{UE}}$ or $N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{common}}$,
as defined in \[4, TS 38.211\], is not zero, *the* window starts after
an additional $T_{\text{TA}} + k_{\text{mac}}$ msec where
$T_{\text{TA}}$ *is defined in \[4, TS 38.211\] and* $k_{\text{mac}}$ is
provided by *kmac* or $k_{\text{mac}} = 0$ if *kmac* is not provided.
The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by *ra-ResponseWindow*.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1b\]

The MAC entity shall:

...

1\> else if contention free Random Access Resources have not been
provided for this Random Access procedure and the BWP selected for the
Random Access procedure is configured with set(s) of Random Access
resources with *msg1-Repetitions* set to *true* and set(s) of Random
Access resources without *msg1-Repetitions* set to *true:*

applicable for the current Random Access procedure includes 2.

2\> else if the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is not less than
any configured *rsrp-ThresholdMsg1-RepetitionNumX:*

3\> assume Msg1 repetition is not applicable for the current Random
Access procedure.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3\]

...

1\> else if an SSB is selected above:

2\> if the set of Random Access resources associated with Msg1
repetition is selected for this Random Access procedure:

3\> determine the next available set of PRACH occasions (as specified in
TS 38.213 \[6\]) for the Msg1 repetition number applicable for this
Random Access procedure corresponding to the selected SSB (the MAC
entity shall select a set of PRACH occasions randomly with equal
probability amongst sets of PRACH occasions according to clause 8.1 of
TS 38.213 \[6\] regardless the FR2 UL gap, corresponding to the selected
SSB and selected Msg1 repetition number for this Random Access
procedure; the MAC entity may take into account the possible occurrence
of measurement gaps and MUSIM gaps when determining the next available
set of PRACH occasions corresponding to the selected SSB).

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.2\]

The RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which the Random
Access Preamble is transmitted or the RA-RNTI associated with the last
valid PRACH occasion in the set of PRACH occasions (as specified in TS
38.213 \[6\]) for Msg1 repetition, is computed as:

RA-RNTI = 1 + s\_id + 14 × t\_id + 14 × 80 × f\_id + 14 × 80 × 8 ×
ul\_carrier\_id

where s\_id is the index of the first OFDM symbol of the PRACH occasion
(0 ≤ s\_id \< 14), t\_id is the index of the first slot of the PRACH
occasion in a system frame (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), where the subcarrier
spacing to determine t\_id is based on the value of μ specified in
clause 5.3.2 in TS 38.211 \[8\] for μ = {0, 1, 2, 3}, and for μ = {5,
6}, t\_id is the index of the 120 kHz slot in a system frame that
contains the PRACH occasion (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), f\_id is the index of the
PRACH occasion in the frequency domain (0 ≤ f\_id \< 8), and
ul\_carrier\_id is the UL carrier used for Random Access Preamble
transmission (0 for NUL carrier, and 1 for SUL carrier).

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.4\]

1\> if *ra-ResponseWindow* configured in *RACH-ConfigCommon* expires,
and if the Random Access Response containing Random Access Preamble
identifiers that matches the transmitted *PREAMBLE\_INDEX* has not been
received:

2\> consider the Random Access Response reception not successful;

2\> increment *PREAMBLE\_TRANSMISSION\_COUNTER* by 1;

...

2\> if the Random Access procedure is not completed:

3\> if the Random Access Preamble is transmitted with repetitions and

##### 7.1.1.1.21.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-20 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.213 clause 8.1, 8.2, TS 38.321 clause
5.1.1b, 5.1.2, 5.1.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-18
requirements.

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.1\]

Physical random access procedure for a UE is triggered upon request of a
PRACH transmission by higher layers or by a PDCCH order or LTM Cell
Switch Command MAC CE in clause 6.1.3.75 \[11, TS 38.321\] for a cell. A
configuration by higher layers for a PRACH transmission includes the
following:

\- A configuration for PRACH transmission on the cell \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- A preamble index, a preamble SCS, $P_{PRACH,target}$, a corresponding
RA-RNTI when applicable \[11, TS 38.321\], and a PRACH resource for the
cell.

\- A number of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}} > 1$ preamble
repetitions for the PRACH transmission if the UE would transmit the
PRACH with repetitions.

A UE transmits a PRACH on a cell using the selected PRACH format with
transmission power $P_{PRACH,b,f,c}(i)$, as described in clause 7.4, on
the indicated PRACH resource or on a determined set of
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ resources using a same spatial filter
in case of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ preamble repetitions.

...

For a PRACH transmission with $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$
preamble repetitions, a set consists of
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ valid PRACH occasions that are
consecutive in time, use same frequency resources, and are associated
with same one or more SS/PBCH block index(es), and each SS/PBCH block
index is associated with same preamble indexes in all valid PRACH
occasions within the set.

For a PRACH transmission with preamble repetitions, a time period,
starting from frame 0, is the smallest integer number of association
pattern periods such that at least one set of valid PRACH occasions for
each of the $N_{\text{Tx}}^{\text{SSB}}$ SS/PBCH block indexes can be
determined within the time period for all configured number of preamble
repetitions. The set(s) of valid PRACH occasions for each configured
number of preamble repetitions repeats every time period.

Within a time period, for set(s) of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$
valid PRACH occasions for a PRACH transmission with
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ preamble repetitions

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid
PRACH occasion

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any, is
determined according to an ordering of valid PRACH occasions

\- first, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for
frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions

\- second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time
multiplexed PRACH occasions

where, for each frequency resource index for frequency multiplexed PRACH
occasions

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid
PRACH occasion

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any,

\- is after *msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* consecutive valid PRACH
occasions in time from the first valid PRACH occasion of the previous
set, where each PRACH occasion is associated with same SS/PBCH block
index(es) and each SS/PBCH block index is associated with same
preambles, if *msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* is provided

\- is after **the** PRACH occasions **for the previous** set, if
*msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* is not provided

...

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.2\]

In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a
window controlled by higher layers \[11, TS 38.321\] if the PRACH
transmission is not triggered by a PDCCH order that includes a Cell
Indicator field with non-zero value; otherwise, the UE does not attempt
to detect the DCI format 1\_0. The window starts at the first symbol of
the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one
symbol, after the last symbol of the last PRACH occasion corresponding
to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the
SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined in clause 10.1. If
$N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{UE}}$ or $N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{common}}$,
as defined in \[4, TS 38.211\], is not zero, *the* window starts after
an additional $T_{\text{TA}} + k_{\text{mac}}$ msec where
$T_{\text{TA}}$ *is defined in \[4, TS 38.211\] and* $k_{\text{mac}}$ is
provided by *kmac* or $k_{\text{mac}} = 0$ if *kmac* is not provided.
The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by *ra-ResponseWindow*.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1b\]

1\> else if Random Access resources for SI request have been provided
for this Random Access procedure:

2\> if Random Access Resources associated with Msg1 repetition for SI
request and Msg1 repetition number have been provided for this Random
Access procedure:

...

3\> else:

4\> select the set of Random Access resources that is only configured
with Msg1 repetition indication and associated with the indicated Msg1
repetition number for this Random Access procedure.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1e\]

The MAC entity shall:

1\> if *si-RequestResourcesRepetitionNum8* is configured and the RSRP of
the downlink pathloss reference is less than
*rsrp-ThresholdMsg1-RepetitionNum8*:

2\> criteria to apply Msg1 repetition for SI request is considered met
and Msg1 repetition number applicable is 8.

1\> else if *si-RequestResourcesRepetitionNum4* is configured and the
RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than
*rsrp-ThresholdMsg1-RepetitionNum4*:

2\> criteria to apply Msg1 repetition for SI request is considered met
and Msg1 repetition number applicable is 4.

1\> else *si-RequestResourcesRepetitionNum2* is configured *and* the
RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than
*rsrp-ThresholdMsg1-RepetitionNum2:*

2\> criteria to apply Msg1 repetition for SI request is considered met
and Msg1 repetition number applicable is 2.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3\]

The RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which the Random
Access Preamble is transmitted or the RA-RNTI associated with the last
valid PRACH occasion in the set of PRACH occasions (as specified in TS
38.213 \[6\]) for Msg1 repetition, is computed as:

RA-RNTI = 1 + s\_id + 14 × t\_id + 14 × 80 × f\_id + 14 × 80 × 8 ×
ul\_carrier\_id

where s\_id is the index of the first OFDM symbol of the PRACH occasion
(0 ≤ s\_id \< 14), t\_id is the index of the first slot of the PRACH
occasion in a system frame (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), where the subcarrier
spacing to determine t\_id is based on the value of μ specified in
clause 5.3.2 in TS 38.211 \[8\] for μ = {0, 1, 2, 3}, and for μ = {5,
6}, t\_id is the index of the 120 kHz slot in a system frame that
contains the PRACH occasion (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), f\_id is the index of the
PRACH occasion in the frequency domain (0 ≤ f\_id \< 8), and
ul\_carrier\_id is the UL carrier used for Random Access Preamble
transmission (0 for NUL carrier, and 1 for SUL carrier).

##### 7.1.1.1.22 Random access procedure / Msg1 repetition / BWP only configured with RACH resource for coverage enhancement

##### 7.1.1.1.22.1 Test Purpose (TP) {#test-purpose-tp-21 .H6}

##### (1) {#section-65 .H6}

**with** { UE is in RRC\_connected state and is configured with only
RACH resources for Msg1 repetition in active BWP }

**ensure that** {

**when** { UE has data available for transmission but does not receive
any UL grant }

**then** { UE initiates a Random Access procedure with Msg1 repetition
of configured repetition number }

}

##### 7.1.1.1.22.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-21 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.213 clause 8.1, 8.2, TS 38.321 clause
5.1.1b, 5.1.2, 5.1.4. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-18
requirements.

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.1\]

Physical random access procedure for a UE is triggered upon request of a
PRACH transmission by higher layers or by a PDCCH order or LTM Cell
Switch Command MAC CE in clause 6.1.3.75 \[11, TS 38.321\] for a cell. A
configuration by higher layers for a PRACH transmission includes the
following:

\- A configuration for PRACH transmission on the cell \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- A preamble index, a preamble SCS, $P_{PRACH,target}$, a corresponding
RA-RNTI when applicable \[11, TS 38.321\], and a PRACH resource for the
cell.

\- A number of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}} > 1$ preamble
repetitions for the PRACH transmission if the UE would transmit the
PRACH with repetitions.

A UE transmits a PRACH on a cell using the selected PRACH format with
transmission power $P_{PRACH,b,f,c}(i)$, as described in clause 7.4, on
the indicated PRACH resource or on a determined set of
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ resources using a same spatial filter
in case of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ preamble repetitions.

...

For a PRACH transmission with $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$
preamble repetitions, a set consists of
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ valid PRACH occasions that are
consecutive in time, use same frequency resources, and are associated
with same one or more SS/PBCH block index(es), and each SS/PBCH block
index is associated with same preamble indexes in all valid PRACH
occasions within the set.

For a PRACH transmission with preamble repetitions, a time period,
starting from frame 0, is the smallest integer number of association
pattern periods such that at least one set of valid PRACH occasions for
each of the $N_{\text{Tx}}^{\text{SSB}}$ SS/PBCH block indexes can be
determined within the time period for all configured number of preamble
repetitions. The set(s) of valid PRACH occasions for each configured
number of preamble repetitions repeats every time period.

Within a time period, for set(s) of $N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$
valid PRACH occasions for a PRACH transmission with
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{rep}}$ preamble repetitions

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid
PRACH occasion

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any, is
determined according to an ordering of valid PRACH occasions

\- first, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for
frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions

\- second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time
multiplexed PRACH occasions

where, for each frequency resource index for frequency multiplexed PRACH
occasions

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of the first set is the first valid
PRACH occasion

\- the first valid PRACH occasion of subsequent sets, if any,

\- is after *msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* consecutive valid PRACH
occasions in time from the first valid PRACH occasion of the previous
set, where each PRACH occasion is associated with same SS/PBCH block
index(es) and each SS/PBCH block index is associated with same
preambles, if *msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* is provided

\- is after **the** PRACH occasions **for the previous** set, if
*msg1-RepetitionTimeOffsetROGroup* is not provided

...

\[TS 38.213 clause 8.2\]

In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a
window controlled by higher layers \[11, TS 38.321\] if the PRACH
transmission is not triggered by a PDCCH order that includes a Cell
Indicator field with non-zero value; otherwise, the UE does not attempt
to detect the DCI format 1\_0. The window starts at the first symbol of
the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one
symbol, after the last symbol of the last PRACH occasion corresponding
to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the
SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined in clause 10.1. If
$N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{UE}}$ or $N_{\text{TA,adj}}^{\text{common}}$,
as defined in \[4, TS 38.211\], is not zero, *the* window starts after
an additional $T_{\text{TA}} + k_{\text{mac}}$ msec where
$T_{\text{TA}}$ *is defined in \[4, TS 38.211\] and* $k_{\text{mac}}$ is
provided by *kmac* or $k_{\text{mac}} = 0$ if *kmac* is not provided.
The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by *ra-ResponseWindow*.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1b\]

The MAC entity shall:

...

1\> else if *the BWP selected for Random Access procedure is configured
only with Random Access resources with msg1-Repetitions set to true:*

2\> assume Msg1 repetition is applicable for the current Random Access
procedure;

...

2\> else (none of *rsrp-ThresholdMsg1-RepetitionNumX* is configured):

3\> assume Msg1 repetition number applicable for the current Random
Access procedure is the Msg1 repetition number that configured for this
BWP*.*

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.3\]

The RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH occasion in which the Random
Access Preamble is transmitted or the RA-RNTI associated with the last
valid PRACH occasion in the set of PRACH occasions (as specified in TS
38.213 \[6\]) for Msg1 repetition, is computed as:

RA-RNTI = 1 + s\_id + 14 × t\_id + 14 × 80 × f\_id + 14 × 80 × 8 ×
ul\_carrier\_id

where s\_id is the index of the first OFDM symbol of the PRACH occasion
(0 ≤ s\_id \< 14), t\_id is the index of the first slot of the PRACH
occasion in a system frame (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), where the subcarrier
spacing to determine t\_id is based on the value of μ specified in
clause 5.3.2 in TS 38.211 \[8\] for μ = {0, 1, 2, 3}, and for μ = {5,
6}, t\_id is the index of the 120 kHz slot in a system frame that
contains the PRACH occasion (0 ≤ t\_id \< 80), f\_id is the index of the
PRACH occasion in the frequency domain (0 ≤ f\_id \< 8), and
ul\_carrier\_id is the UL carrier used for Random Access Preamble

##### 7.1.1.1.24.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-22 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present test
case are specified in: TS 38.321, clause 6.2.1 and TS38.331,clause
5.3.13.3. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-18 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.2.1\]

The MAC subheader consists of the following fields:

\- LCID: The Logical Channel ID field identifies the logical channel
instance of the corresponding MAC SDU or the type of the corresponding
MAC CE or padding as described in Tables 6.2.1-1 and 6.2.1-1c for the
DL-SCH and Tables 6.2.1-2 and 6.2.1-2c for the UL-SCH. There is one LCID
field per MAC subheader. The size of the LCID field is 6 bits. If the
LCID field is set to 34 as in Table 6.2.1-1 or 6.2.1-2, one additional
octet is present in the MAC subheader containing the eLCID field and
follow the octet containing LCID field. If the LCID field is set to 33
as in Table 6.2.1-1 or 6.2.1-2, two additional octets are present in the
MAC subheader containing the eLCID field and these two additional octets
follow the octet containing LCID field;

NOTE 1: For MBS broadcast, a logical channel is identified based on
G-RNTI and LCID if the same LCID is allocated for logical channels
corresponding to different G-RNTIs.

\- eLCID: The extended Logical Channel ID field identifies the logical
channel instance of the corresponding MAC SDU or the type of the
corresponding MAC CE as described in tables 6.2.1-1a, 6.2.1-1b, 6.2.1-2a
and 6.2.1-2b for the DL-SCH and UL-SCH respectively. The size of the
eLCID field is either 8 bits or 16 bits.

NOTE 2: The extended Logical Channel ID space using two-octet eLCID and
the relevant MAC subheader format is used, only when configured, on the
NR backhaul links between IAB nodes or between IAB node and IAB Donor,
or for multicast MTCHs.

\- L: The Length field indicates the length of the corresponding MAC SDU
or variable-sized MAC CE in bytes. There is one L field per MAC
subheader except for subheaders corresponding to fixed-sized MAC CEs,
padding, and MAC SDUs containing UL CCCH. The size of the L field is
indicated by the F field;

\- F: The Format field indicates the size of the Length field. There is
one F field per MAC subheader except for subheaders corresponding to
fixed-sized MAC CEs, padding, and MAC SDUs containing UL CCCH. The size
of the F field is 1 bit. The value 0 indicates 8 bits of the Length
field. The value 1 indicates 16 bits of the Length field;

\- LX: The LCID extension field indicates the use of extended LCID
space. The size of the LX field is 1 bit. The LX field set to 1
indicates the use of Table 6.2.1-2c, otherwise R bit is present instead
(i.e. set to 0);

\- R: Reserved bit, set to 0.

The MAC subheader is octet aligned.

values configured by RRC for the selected set of Random Access
resources:

...

*- FeatureCombination*: feature or a combination of features associated
with a set of Random Access resources;

*- featurePriorities*: priorities for features, such as (e)RedCap,
Slicing, etc. (see clause 5.1.1d);

...

\- *startPreambleForThisPartition*: the ***first preamble associated
with the set of Random Access Resources applicable to the Random Access
procedure***;

...

\- *numberOfPreamblesPerSSB-ForThisPartition*: defines the number of
***consecutive preambles for*** a feature or a combination of features
mapped to each SSB;

...

When the Random Access procedure is initiated on a Serving Cell or for
an LTM candidate cell, the MAC entity shall:

...

1\> perform the BWP operation as specified in clause 5.15, except when
the Random Access procedure is initiated by the PDCCH order for an LTM
candidate cell;

1\> select the set of Random Access resources applicable to the current
Random Access procedure according to clause 5.1.1b;

1\> if neither contention-free Random Access Resources nor Random Access
Resources for SI request have been provided for this Random Access
procedure and one or more of the features including (e)RedCap and/or
Slicing and/or SDT and/or MSG3 repetition and/or MSG1 repetition is
applicable for this Random Access procedure:

NOTE 2: The applicability of SDT is determined by MAC entity according
to clause 5.27. The applicability of *NSAG-ID* is determined by upper
layers when the Random Access procedure is initiated. The applicability
of (e)RedCap is also determined by upper layers when Random Access
procedure is initiated and it is applicable to the Random Access
procedures initiated by PDCCH orders and any Random Access procedure
initiated by the MAC entity.

NOTE 3: SDT is not applicable for the Random Access procedure initiated
by upper layers for MT-SDT.

2\> if none of the sets of Random Access resources are available for any
feature applicable to the current Random Access procedure (as specified
in clause 5.1.1c):

3\> select the set(s) of Random Access resources that are not associated
with any feature indication (as specified in clause 5.1.1c) for this
Random Access procedure.

2\> else if there is one set of Random Access resources available which
can be used for indicating all features triggering this Random Access
procedure:

3\> select this set of Random Access resources for this Random Access
procedure.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1c\]

The MAC entity shall for each set of configured Random Access resources:

1\> if *eRedCap* is set to *true* for a set of Random Access resources:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources as not available for a
Random Access procedure for which eRedCap is not applicable.

1\> if *redCap* is set to *true* for a set of Random Access resources:

2\> consider the set of Random Access resources as not available for a
Random Access procedure for which RedCap is not applicable.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.1d\]

The MAC entity shall:

1\> among the available sets of Random Access resources for this Random
Access procedure (as specified in clause 5.1.1c), identify those
configured with a feature which has the highest priority assigned in
*featurePriorities* among all the features applicable to this Random
Access procedure as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\].

1\> if a single set of Random Access resources is identified:

2\> select this set of Random Access resources.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.1.5\]

1\> if notification of a reception of a PDCCH transmission of the SpCell
is received from lower layers:

2\> if the C-RNTI MAC CE was included in Msg3:

...

2\> else if the CCCH SDU was included in Msg3 and the PDCCH transmission
is addressed to its *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*:

3\> if the MAC PDU is successfully decoded:

4\> stop *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer*;

4\> if the MAC PDU contains a UE Contention Resolution Identity MAC CE;
and

4\> if the UE Contention Resolution Identity in the MAC CE matches the
CCCH SDU transmitted in Msg3:

5\> consider this Contention Resolution successful and finish the
disassembly and demultiplexing of the MAC PDU;

5\> if this Random Access procedure was initiated for SI request:

6\> indicate the reception of an acknowledgement for SI request to upper
layers.

5\> else:

6\> set the C-RNTI to the value of the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*;

5\> discard the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*;

5\> consider this Random Access procedure successfully completed.

4\> else:

5\> discard the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*;

5\> consider this Contention Resolution not successful and discard the
successfully decoded MAC PDU.

3\> else, for eRedCap UE, if lower layer detects that PDSCH transmission
scheduled by PDCCH has a larger bandwidth than UE can receive or process
per slot:

4\> stop *ra-ContentionResolutionTimer*;

4\> discard the *TEMPORARY\_C-RNTI*;

4\> consider this Contention Resolution not successful.

\[TS 38.300, clause 16.13.3\]

A RedCap UE can be identified by the network during Random Access
procedure via MSG3/MSGA from a RedCap specific LCID(s) and optionally
via MSG1/MSGA (PRACH occasion or PRACH preamble). An eRedCap UE can be
identified by the network during Random Access procedure via MSG3/MSGA
from an eRedCap specific LCID(s) and optionally via MSG1. For RedCap UE
identification via MSG1/MSGA, RedCap specific Random Access
configuration may be configured by the network. For eRedCap UE
identification via MSG1, eRedCap specific Random Access configuration
may be configured by the network. For MSG3/MSGA, an (e)RedCap UE is
identified by the dedicated LCID(s) indicated for CCCH identification
(CCCH or CCCH1) regardless whether (e)RedCap specific Random Access
configuration is configured by the network.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.2.1\]

The MAC subheader consists of the following fields:

\- LCID: The Logical Channel ID field identifies the logical channel
instance of the corresponding MAC SDU or the type of the corresponding
MAC CE or padding as described in Tables 6.2.1-1 and 6.2.1-1c for the
DL-SCH and Tables 6.2.1-2 and 6.2.1-2c for the UL-SCH. There is one LCID
field per MAC subheader. The size of the LCID field is 6 bits. If the
LCID field is set to 34 as in Table 6.2.1-1 or 6.2.1-2, one additional
octet is present in the MAC subheader containing the eLCID field and
follow the octet containing LCID field. If the LCID field is set to 33
as in Table 6.2.1-1 or 6.2.1-2, two additional octets are present in the
MAC subheader containing the eLCID field and these two additional octets
follow the octet containing LCID field;

...

\- LX: The LCID extension field indicates the use of extended LCID
space. The size of the LX field is 1 bit. The LX field set to 1
indicates the use of Table 6.2.1-2c, otherwise R bit is present instead
(i.e. set to 0);

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.1\]

Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a
transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the
relevant HARQ information.

When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI or
G-CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it
monitors PDCCH and for each Serving Cell:

1\> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion and this Serving
Cell has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, or
Temporary C‑RNTI, or G-RNTI configured for multicast MTCH:

2\> if this is the first downlink assignment for this Temporary C-RNTI:

3\> consider the NDI to have been toggled.

2\> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, and if
the previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the
same HARQ process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC
entity\'s CS-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or a configured downlink assignment for
unicast or MBS multicast; or

2\> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity\'s G-RNTI
configured for multicast MTCH, and if the previous downlink assignment
indicated to the HARQ entity of the same HARQ process was either a
downlink assignment received for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI,
or other G-RNTI, or C-RNTI, or a configured downlink assignment for
unicast or MBS multicast:

3\> consider the NDI to have been toggled regardless of the value of the
NDI.

2\> stop the *cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer*, if it is running, for the
corresponding HARQ process for initial transmission with CCCH message;

2\> stop the *cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer*, if it is running, for the
corresponding HARQ process for initial transmission of RACH-less
handover or for the first PUSCH transmission at RACH-less LTM cell
switch;

2\> stop the *configuredGrantTimer*, if it is running, for the
corresponding HARQ process for initial transmission with CCCH message;

2\> if the downlink assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the
MAC entity\'s C-RNTI after the first PUSCH transmission to the Serving
Cell:

3\> if there is an ongoing RACH-less handover procedure:

4\> consider the RACH-less handover to be successfully completed and
indicate it to upper layers.

3\> else if RACH-less LTM cell switch is ongoing:

4\> consider the LTM cell switch to be successfully completed and
indicate it to upper layers.

2\> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the
associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.4.1\]

If the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, a Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC
entity shall for each PDCCH occasion and for each Serving Cell belonging
to a TAG that has a running *timeAlignmentTimer* or a running
*cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer* and for each grant received for this PDCCH
occasion:

1\> if an uplink grant for this Serving Cell has been received on the
PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI or Temporary C-RNTI; or

1\> if an uplink grant has been received in a Random Access Response:

2\> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity\'s C-RNTI and if the previous
uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was
either an uplink grant received for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI or a
configured uplink grant:

3\> consider the NDI to have been toggled for the corresponding HARQ
process regardless of the value of the NDI.

2\> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, and the identified
HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant:

3\> start or restart the *configuredGrantTimer* for the corresponding
HARQ process, if configured;

3\> stop the *cg-RetransmissionTimer* for the corresponding HARQ
process, if running.

2\> stop the *cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ
process*, if running.

2\> stop the *cg-RRC-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ
process*, if running.

2\> if the uplink grant has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC
entity\'s C-RNTI after the first PUSCH transmission to the Serving Cell;
and

2\> if the uplink grant is for a new transmission on the same HARQ
process used for the first PUSCH transmission to the Serving Cell:

3\> if there is an ongoing RACH-less handover procedure:

4\> consider the RACH-less handover to be successfully completed and
indicate to upper layers.

3\> else if there is an ongoing RACH-less LTM cell switch:

4\> consider the LTM cell switch to be successfully completed and
indicate it to upper layers.

To improve NR uplink coverage in NTN, the following enhancements are
supported:

> \- PUCCH repetition for Msg4 HARQ-ACK configured in system information
> or dynamically in DCI for Msg4 when multiple repetition factors are
> configured in the system information:
>
> \- UEs reports the capability of PUCCH repetition for Msg4 HARQ-ACK in
> Msg3 PUSCH;
>
> \- When Msg4 HARQ-ACK is repeated, PUCCH repetition is applied for all
> PUCCH transmission before dedicated PUCCH resource is provided.
>
> \- Improved channel estimation by NTN-specific PUSCH DMRS bundling
> enhancement that enables DMRS bundling in presence of timing drift,
> where the UE maintains phase continuity by considering effects of
> transmission delay variation between the UE and the uplink time
> synchronization reference point.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.2\]

A MAC subheader except for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU
containing UL CCCH consists of the header fields R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L. A
MAC subheader for fixed sized MAC CE and padding consists of the header
fields R/LCID/(eLCID). A MAC subheader for a MAC SDU containing UL CCCH
consists of the header fields (LX)/R/LCID.

\...

**Figure 6.1.2-3: (LX)/R/LCID/(eLCID) MAC subheader**

MAC CEs are placed together. DL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed
before any MAC subPDU with MAC SDU and MAC subPDU with padding as
depicted in Figure 6.1.2-4. UL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed
after all the MAC subPDU(s) with MAC SDU and before the MAC subPDU with
padding in the MAC PDU as depicted in Figure 6.1.2-5. The size of
padding can be zero.

**Figure 6.1.2-4: Example of a DL MAC PDU**

**Figure 6.1.2-5: Example of a UL MAC PDU**

A maximum of one MAC PDU can be transmitted per TB per MAC entity.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.2.1\]

The MAC subheader consists of the following fields:

> \- LCID: The Logical Channel ID field identifies the logical channel
> instance of the corresponding MAC SDU or the type of the corresponding
> MAC CE or padding as described in Tables 6.2.1-1 and 6.2.1-1c for the
> DL-SCH and Tables 6.2.1-2 and 6.2.1-2c for the UL-SCH. There is one
> LCID field per MAC subheader. The size of the LCID field is 6 bits. If
> the LCID field is set to 34 as in Table 6.2.1-1 or 6.2.1-2, one
> additional octet is present in the MAC subheader containing the eLCID
> field and follow the octet containing LCID field. If the LCID field is
> set to 33 as in Table 6.2.1-1 or 6.2.1-2, two additional octets are
> present in the MAC subheader containing the eLCID field and these two
> additional octets follow the octet containing LCID field;
>
> NOTE 1: For MBS broadcast, a logical channel is identified based on
> G-RNTI and LCID if the same LCID is allocated for logical channels
> corresponding to different G-RNTIs.
>
> \- eLCID: The extended Logical Channel ID field identifies the logical

> corresponding MAC CE as described in tables 6.2.1-1a, 6.2.1-1b,
> 6.2.1-2a and 6.2.1-2b for the DL-SCH and UL-SCH respectively. The size

> Donor, or for multicast MTCHs.
>
> \- L: The Length field indicates the length of the corresponding MAC
> SDU or variable-sized MAC CE in bytes. There is one L field per MAC
> subheader except for subheaders corresponding to fixed-sized MAC CEs,

>
> \- F: The Format field indicates the size of the Length field. There

\[TS 38.213, clause 9.2.6\]

A UE that does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration and
indicates a capability to transmit with repetitions a PUCCH with
HARQ-ACK information \[11, TS 38.321\], determines a number of
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots for repetitions of a PUCCH
transmission with HARQ-ACK information based on an indication by
*numberOfPUCCHforMsg4HARQACK-RepetitionsList*. If
*numberOfPUCCHforMsg4HARQACK-RepetitionsList* provides more than one
values, the DAI field in a DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a
TC-RNTI scheduling a PDSCH reception that includes a UE contention
resolution identity indicates $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ from
the more than one values. The UE transmits any PUCCH with repetitions
over $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots before dedicated PUCCH
resource configuration is provided. The UE transmits each repetition of
the PUCCH using frequency hopping as described in Clause 9.2.1.

\[TS 38.213, clause 9.2.1\]

If a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided
by *PUCCH-ResourceSet* in *PUCCH-Config*, a PUCCH resource set is
provided by *pucch-ResourceCommon* through an index to a row of Table
9.2.1-1 for transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial
UL BWP of $N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}$ PRBs. For operation in FR2-2,
*nrofPRBs* provided in *PUCCH-ConfigCommon* can also provide a number of
$N_{\text{RB}}$ RBs for the PUCCH resource set; otherwise
$N_{\text{RB}} = 1$.

The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to
a PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset
$\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}}$, and a cyclic shift index set
for a PUCCH transmission.

The UE transmits a PUCCH using frequency hopping if not provided
*useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon*; otherwise, *the UE
transmits a PUCCH without frequency hopping*.

##### 7.1.1.2.1.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-28 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.3.1, 5.3.2.1, 5.3.2.2 and 6.1.2.
Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.1\]

Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a
transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the
relevant HARQ information.

When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC
entity shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it monitors PDCCH and
for each Serving Cell:

1\> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion and this Serving
Cell has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, or
Temporary C‑RNTI:

2\> if this is the first downlink assignment for this Temporary C-RNTI:

3\> consider the NDI to have been toggled.

2\> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, and if
the previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the
same HARQ process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC
entity's CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment:

3\> consider the NDI to have been toggled regardless of the value of the
NDI.

2\> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the
associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

1\> else if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been
received for this Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity's
CS-RNTI:

2\> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:

3\> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been
toggled;

3\> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment for this Serving Cell
and deliver the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

2\> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:

3\> if PDCCH contents indicate SPS deactivation:

4\> clear the configured downlink assignment for this Serving Cell (if
any);

4\> if the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the PTAG is running:

5\> indicate a positive acknowledgement for the SPS deactivation to the
physical layer.

3\> else if PDCCH content indicates SPS activation:

4\> store the downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and the
associated HARQ information as configured downlink assignment;

4\> initialise or re-initialise the configured downlink assignment for
this Serving Cell to start in the associated PDSCH duration and to recur
according to rules in subclause 5.8.1;

4\> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this
PDSCH duration;

4\> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been
toggled;

4\> indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment for this
Serving Cell and deliver the stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

For each Serving Cell and each configured downlink assignment, if
configured and activated, the MAC entity shall:

1\> if the PDSCH duration of the configured downlink assignment does not
overlap with the PDSCH duration of a downlink assignment received on the
PDCCH for this Serving Cell:

2\> instruct the physical layer to receive, in this PDSCH duration,
transport block on the DL-SCH according to the configured downlink
assignment and to deliver it to the HARQ entity;

2\> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this
PDSCH duration;

2\> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;

2\> indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment and
deliver the stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

For configured downlink assignments, the HARQ Process ID associated with
the slot where the DL transmission starts is derived from the following
equation:

HARQ Process ID = \[floor (CURRENT\_slot × 10 / (numberOfSlotsPerFrame ×
semiPersistSchedIntervalDL))\] modulo nrofHARQ-Processes

where CURRENT\_slot = \[(SFN × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame*) + slot number in
the frame\] and *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* refers to the number of
consecutive slots per frame as specified in TS 38.211 \[8\].

When the MAC entity needs to read BCCH, the MAC entity may, based on the
scheduling information from RRC:

1\> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received
on the PDCCH for the SI-RNTI;

2\> indicate a downlink assignment and redundancy version for the
dedicated broadcast HARQ process to the HARQ entity.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.2\]

When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or more (in
case of downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ
information are received from the HARQ entity.

For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process
shall:

1\> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of
the previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is
the first received transmission for the TB according to the system
information schedule indicated by RRC; or

1\> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e.
there is no previous NDI for this TB):

2\> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.

1\> else:

2\> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.

The MAC entity then shall:

1\> if this is a new transmission:

2\> attempt to decode the received data.

1\> else if this is a retransmission:

2\> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:

3\> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the
data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the
combined data.

1\> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was
successfully decoded for this TB; or

1\> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

2\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

2\> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this
TB:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing
entity.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer
for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode;

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful
(see subclause 5.1.5); or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or

1\> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped
or expired:

2\> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of
the data in this TB.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the
data in this TB.

The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on
PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its
C-RNTI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous
transmission.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.2\]

A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs. Each MAC subPDU consists
of one of the following:

\- A MAC subheader only (including padding);

\- A MAC subheader and a MAC SDU;

\- A MAC subheader and a MAC CE;

\- A MAC subheader and padding.

The MAC SDUs are of variable sizes.

Each MAC subheader corresponds to either a MAC SDU, a MAC CE, or
padding.

A MAC subheader except for fixed sized MAC CE and padding consists of
the four header fields R/F/LCID/L. A MAC subheader for fixed sized MAC
CE and padding consists of the two header fields R/LCID.

![](./media/image17.emf)

Figure 6.1.2-3: R/LCID MAC subheader

MAC CEs are placed together. DL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed
before any MAC subPDU with MAC SDU and MAC subPDU with padding as
depicted in Figure 6.1.2-4. UL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed
after all the MAC subPDU(s) with MAC SDU and before the MAC subPDU with
padding in the MAC PDU as depicted in Figure 6.1.2-5. The size of
padding can be zero.

}

##### 7.1.1.2.2.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-29 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.3.1, 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2, TS 38.214,
clause 5.1.2.1. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.1\]

Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a
transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the
relevant HARQ information.

When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC
entity shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it monitors PDCCH and
for each Serving Cell:

1\> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion and this Serving
Cell has been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, or
Temporary C‑RNTI:

2\> if this is the first downlink assignment for this Temporary C-RNTI:

3\> consider the NDI to have been toggled.

2\> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, and if
the previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the
same HARQ process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC
entity\'s CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment:

3\> consider the NDI to have been toggled regardless of the value of the
NDI.

2\> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the
associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

1\> else if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been
received for this Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s
CS-RNTI:

2\> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:

3\> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been
toggled;

3\> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment for this Serving Cell
and deliver the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

2\> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:

3\> if PDCCH contents indicate SPS deactivation:

4\> clear the configured downlink assignment for this Serving Cell (if
any);

4\> if the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the PTAG is running:

5\> indicate a positive acknowledgement for the SPS deactivation to the
physical layer.

3\> else if PDCCH content indicates SPS activation:

4\> store the downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and the
associated HARQ information as configured downlink assignment;

4\> initialise or re-initialise the configured downlink assignment for
this Serving Cell to start in the associated PDSCH duration and to recur
according to rules in subclause 5.8.1;

4\> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this
PDSCH duration;

4\> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been
toggled;

4\> indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment for this
Serving Cell and deliver the stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

For each Serving Cell and each configured downlink assignment, if
configured and activated, the MAC entity shall:

1\> if the PDSCH duration of the configured downlink assignment does not
overlap with the PDSCH duration of a downlink assignment received on the
PDCCH for this Serving Cell:

2\> instruct the physical layer to receive, in this PDSCH duration,
transport block on the DL-SCH according to the configured downlink
assignment and to deliver it to the HARQ entity;

2\> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this
PDSCH duration;

2\> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;

2\> indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment and
deliver the stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity.

For configured downlink assignments, the HARQ Process ID associated with
the slot where the DL transmission starts is derived from the following
equation:

HARQ Process ID = \[floor (CURRENT\_slot × 10 / (*numberOfSlotsPerFrame*
× *periodicity*))\] modulo *nrofHARQ-Processes*

where CURRENT\_slot = \[(SFN × *numberOfSlotsPerFrame*) + slot number in
the frame\] and *numberOfSlotsPerFrame* refers to the number of
consecutive slots per frame as specified in TS 38.211 \[8\].

When the MAC entity needs to read BCCH, the MAC entity may, based on the
scheduling information from RRC:

1\> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received
on the PDCCH for the SI-RNTI;

2\> indicate a downlink assignment and redundancy version for the
dedicated broadcast HARQ process to the HARQ entity.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.1\]

The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell, which
maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes. Each HARQ process is
associated with a HARQ process identifier. The HARQ entity directs HARQ
information and associated TBs received on the DL-SCH to the
corresponding HARQ processes (see subclause 5.3.2.2).

The number of parallel DL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in
TS 38.214 \[7\]. The dedicated broadcast HARQ process is used for BCCH.

The HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not
configured for downlink spatial multiplexing. The HARQ process supports
one or two TBs when the physical layer is configured for downlink
spatial multiplexing.

When the MAC entity is configured with *pdsch-AggregationFactor* \> 1,
the parameter *pdsch-AggregationFactor* provides the number of
transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the dynamic downlink
assignment. Bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking
the same HARQ process for each transmission that is part of the same
bundle. After the initial transmission, *pdsch-AggregationFactor* -- 1
HARQ retransmissions follow within a bundle.

The MAC entity shall:

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated:

2\> allocate the TB(s) received from the physical layer and the
associated HARQ information to the HARQ process indicated by the
associated HARQ information.

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated for the broadcast HARQ
process:

2\> allocate the received TB to the broadcast HARQ process.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.2\]

When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in
case of downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ
information are received from the HARQ entity.

For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process
shall:

1\> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of
the previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is
the first received transmission for the TB according to the system
information schedule indicated by RRC; or

1\> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e.
there is no previous NDI for this TB):

2\> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.

1\> else:

2\> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.

The MAC entity then shall:

1\> if this is a new transmission:

2\> attempt to decode the received data.

1\> else if this is a retransmission:

2\> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:

3\> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the
data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the
combined data.

1\> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was
successfully decoded for this TB; or

1\> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

2\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

2\> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this
TB:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing
entity.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer
for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful
(see subclause 5.1.5); or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or

1\> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped
or expired:

2\> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of
the data in this TB.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the
data in this TB.

The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on
PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its
C-RNTI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous
transmission.

\[TS 38.214, clause 5.1.2.1\]

When the UE is scheduled to receive PDSCH by a DCI, the *Time domain
resource assignment* field value *m* of the DCI provides a row index *m*
+ 1 to an allocation table. The determination of the used resource
allocation table is defined in sub-clause 5.1.2.1.1. The indexed row
defines the slot offset *K~0~*, the start and length indicator *SLIV*,
or directly the start symbol *S* and the allocation length *L*, and the
PDSCH mapping type to be assumed in the PDSCH reception.

Given the parameter values of the indexed row:

\- The slot allocated for the PDSCH is , where *n* is the slot with the
scheduling DCI, and *K~0~* is based on the numerology of PDSCH, and and
are the subcarrier spacing configurations for PDSCH and PDCCH,
respectively, and

\- The starting symbol *S* relative to the start of the slot, and the
number of consecutive symbols *L* counting from the symbol *S* allocated
for the PDSCH are determined from the start and length indicator *SLIV*:

if then

else

where, and

\- The PDSCH mapping type is set to Type A or Type B as defined in
sub-clause 7.4.1.1.2 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

The UE shall consider the *S* and *L* combinations defined in table
5.1.2.1-1 as valid PDSCH allocations:

When the UE is configured with *aggregationF*actorDL \> 1, the same
symbol allocation is applied across the *aggregationFactorDL*
consecutive slots. The UE may expect that the TB is repeated within each
symbol allocation among each of the *aggregationFactorDL* consecutive
slots and the PDSCH is limited to a single transmission layer. The
redundancy version to be applied on the *n*^th^ transmission occasion of
the TB is determined according to table 5.1.2.1-2.

If the UE procedure for determining slot configuration as defined in
Subclause 11.1 of \[6, TS 38.213\] determines symbol of a slot allocated
for PDSCH as uplink symbols, the transmission on that slot is omitted
for multi-slot PDSCH transmission.

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type A in a slot,
if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in the same slot and was
not contained within the first three symbols of the slot.

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type B in a slot,
if the first symbol of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in a
later symbol than the first symbol indicated in the PDSCH time domain
resource allocation.

##### 7.1.1.2.3.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-30 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.1\]

The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell, which
maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes. Each HARQ process is
associated with a HARQ process identifier. The HARQ entity directs HARQ
information and associated TBs received on the DL-SCH to the
corresponding HARQ processes (see subclause 5.3.2.2).

The number of parallel DL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in
TS 38.214 \[7\]. The dedicated broadcast HARQ process is used for BCCH.

The HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not
configured for downlink spatial multiplexing. The HARQ process supports
one or two TBs when the physical layer is configured for downlink
spatial multiplexing.

When the MAC entity is configured with *pdsch-AggregationFactor* \> 1,
the parameter *pdsch-AggregationFactor* provides the number of
transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the dynamic downlink
assignment. Bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking
the same HARQ process for each transmission that is part of the same
bundle. After the initial transmission, *pdsch-AggregationFactor* -- 1
HARQ retransmissions follow within a bundle.

The MAC entity shall:

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated:

2\> allocate the TB(s) received from the physical layer and the
associated HARQ information to the HARQ process indicated by the
associated HARQ information.

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated for the broadcast HARQ
process:

2\> allocate the received TB to the broadcast HARQ process.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.2\]

When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in
case of downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ
information are received from the HARQ entity.

For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process
shall:

1\> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of
the previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is
the first received transmission for the TB according to the system
information schedule indicated by RRC; or

1\> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e.
there is no previous NDI for this TB):

2\> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.

1\> else:

2\> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.

The MAC entity then shall:

1\> if this is a new transmission:

2\> attempt to decode the received data.

1\> else if this is a retransmission:

2\> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:

3\> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the
data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the
combined data.

1\> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was
successfully decoded for this TB; or

1\> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

2\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

2\> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this
TB:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing
entity.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer
for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful
(see subclause 5.1.5); or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or

1\> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped
or expired:

2\> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of
the data in this TB.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the
data in this TB.

The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on
PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its
C-RNTI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous
transmission.

NOTE: If the MAC entity receives a retransmission with a TB size
different from the last TB size signalled for this TB, the UE behavior
is left up to UE implementation.

##### 7.1.1.2.4.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-31 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the current TC are
specified in: TS 38.321, clauses 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2. Unless otherwise
stated these are Rel-15 requirements.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.1\]

The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell, which
maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes. Each HARQ process is
associated with a HARQ process identifier. The HARQ entity directs HARQ
information and associated TBs received on the DL-SCH to the
corresponding HARQ processes (see subclause 5.3.2.2).

The number of parallel DL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in
TS 38.214 \[7\]. The dedicated broadcast HARQ process is used for BCCH.

The HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not
configured for downlink spatial multiplexing. The HARQ process supports
one or two TBs when the physical layer is configured for downlink
spatial multiplexing.

When the MAC entity is configured with *pdsch-AggregationFactor* \> 1,
the parameter *pdsch-AggregationFactor* provides the number of
transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the dynamic downlink
assignment. Bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking
the same HARQ process for each transmission that is part of the same
bundle. After the initial transmission, *pdsch-AggregationFactor* -- 1
HARQ retransmissions follow within a bundle.

The MAC entity shall:

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated:

2\> allocate the TB(s) received from the physical layer and the
associated HARQ information to the HARQ process indicated by the
associated HARQ information.

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated for the broadcast HARQ
process:

2\> allocate the received TB to the broadcast HARQ process.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.2\]

When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in
case of downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ
information are received from the HARQ entity.

For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process
shall:

1\> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of
the previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is
the first received transmission for the TB according to the system
information schedule indicated by RRC; or

1\> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e.
there is no previous NDI for this TB):

2\> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.

1\> else:

2\> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.

The MAC entity then shall:

1\> if this is a new transmission:

2\> attempt to decode the received data.

1\> else if this is a retransmission:

2\> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:

3\> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the
data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the
combined data.

1\> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was
successfully decoded for this TB; or

1\> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

2\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

2\> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this
TB:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing
entity.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer
for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful
(see subclause 5.1.5); or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or

1\> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped
or expired:

2\> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of
the data in this TB.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the
data in this TB.

The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on
PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its
C-RNTI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous
transmission.

NOTE: If the MAC entity receives a retransmission with a TB size
different from the last TB size signalled for this TB, the UE behaviour
is left up to UE implementation.

##### 7.1.1.2.5.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-32 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.213 clause 9, 9.2.4. Unless otherwise stated these
are Rel-16 requirements.

\[TS 38.213, clause 9\]

A PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission, including repetitions if any, can be of
priority index 0 or of priority index 1. For a configured grant PUSCH
transmission, a UE determines a priority index from *phy-PriorityIndex*,
if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information
corresponding to a SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE
determines a priority index from *harq-CodebookID*, if provided. For a
PUCCH transmission with SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority
as described in Clause 9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with
semi-persistent CSI report, a UE determines a priority index from a
priority indicator field, if provided, in a DCI format that activates
the semi-persistent CSI report. If a priority index is not provided to a
UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission, the priority index is 0.

\[TS 38.213, clause 9.1\]

If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList,* the UE can be
indicated by *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList* to generate one or two
HARQ-ACK codebooks. If the UE is indicated to generate one HARQ-ACK
codebook, the HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority
index 0. If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList*, the UE
multiplexes in a same HARQ-ACK codebook only HARQ-ACK information
associated with a same priority index. If the UE is indicated to
generate two HARQ-ACK codebooks

> \- a first HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority
> index 0 and a second HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of
> priority index 1

\[TS 38.213, clause 9.2.4\]

A UE can be configured by *SchedulingRequestResourceConfig* a set of
configurations for SR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format
0 or PUCCH format 1. A UE can be configured by
*schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell* a configuration for LRR in a PUCCH
transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE can
be provided, by *phy-PriorityIndex* in
*SchedulingRequestResourceConfig*, a priority index 0 or a priority
index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR,
the priority index is 0.

requirements.

\[TS 38.213 clause 9.2.6\]

A UE can be indicated to transmit a PUCCH over
![](./media/image25.png)![](./media/image25.png) slots using a PUCCH
resource, where

\- if the PUCCH resource is indicated by a DCI format and includes
*pucch-RepetitionNrofSlots*,
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) is provided by
*pucch-RepetitionNrofSlots*

\- otherwise, ![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) is
provided by *nrofSlots*

...

For ![](./media/image27.png)![](./media/image27.png),

\- the UE repeats the PUCCH transmission with the UCI over
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) slots

\- a repetition of the PUCCH transmission in each of the
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) slots has a same number
of consecutive symbols, as provided by *nrofSymbols*

\- a repetition of the PUCCH transmission in each of the
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) slots has a same first
symbol, as provided by *startingSymbolIndex* *if subslotLengthForPUCCH
is not provided; otherwise mod(startingSymbolIndex,
subslotLengthForPUCCH)*

\- the UE is configured by *interslotFrequencyHopping* whether or not to
perform frequency hopping for repetitions of the PUCCH transmission in
different slots

\- if the UE is configured to perform frequency hopping for repetitions
of a PUCCH transmission across slots and the UE is not provided
*PUCCH-DMRS-Bundling* = \'enabled\'

\- the UE performs frequency hopping per slot

\- the UE transmits the PUCCH starting from a first PRB, provided by
*startingPRB*, in slots with even number and starting from a second PRB,
provided by *secondHopPRB*, in slots with odd number. The slot indicated
to the UE for the first repetition of the PUCCH transmission has number
0 and each subsequent slot until the UE transmits the PUCCH in
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) slots is counted
regardless of whether or not the UE transmits the PUCCH in the slot

\- the UE does not expect to be configured to perform frequency hopping
for a repetition of the PUCCH transmission within a slot

...

\- if the UE is not configured to perform frequency hopping for
repetitions of a PUCCH transmission across slots and the UE is
configured to perform frequency hopping for a repetition of the PUCCH
transmission within a slot, the frequency hopping pattern between the
first PRB and the second PRB is same within each slot

If the UE determines that, for a repetition of a PUCCH transmission in a
slot, the number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission is
smaller than the value provided by *nrofSymbols* for the corresponding
PUCCH format, the UE does not transmit the PUCCH repetition in the slot.

A SS/PBCH block symbol is a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with candidate
SS/PBCH block index corresponding to the SS/PBCH block index indicated
to a UE by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1* or *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in
*ServingCellConfigCommon* or by *NonCellDefiningSSB if* provided or, if
the UE is not provided *dl-OrJointTCI-StateList*, by
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SSB-MTCAdditionalPCI* associated to physical
cell ID with active TCI states for PDCCH or PDSCH, or for a set of
symbols of a slot corresponding to SS/PBCH blocks configured for L1 beam
measurement/reporting.

For unpaired spectrum, the UE determines the
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) slots for a PUCCH
transmission starting from a slot indicated to the UE as described in
clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK reporting, or a slot determined as described
in clause 9.2.4 for SR reporting or in clause 5.2.1.4 of \[6, TS
38.214\] for CSI reporting and having

\- an UL symbol, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible symbol that is
not SS/PBCH block symbol provided by *startingSymbolIndex* as a first
symbol, and

\- consecutive UL symbols, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible
symbols that are not SS/PBCH block symbols, starting from the first
symbol, equal to or larger than a number of symbols provided by
*nrofsymbols*

For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band, the UE determines the
![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png) slots for a PUCCH
transmission as the ![](./media/image26.png)![](./media/image26.png)
consecutive slots starting from a slot indicated to the UE as described
in clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK reporting, or a slot determined as
described in clause 9.2.4 for SR reporting or in clause 5.2.1.4 of \[6,
TS 38.214\] for CSI reporting.

...

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.1\]

Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a
transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the
relevant HARQ information.

When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI or
G-CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it
monitors PDCCH and for each Serving Cell:

##### 7.1.1.2.7.2 Conformance requirements {#conformance-requirements-34 .H6}

References: The conformance requirements covered in the present TC are
specified in: TS 38.214 clause 5.1.5, TS 38.321, clauses 5.3.1, 5.3.2.1,
5.3.2.2 and 6.1.3.47. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-17
requirements.

\[TS 38.214 clause 5.1.5\]

The UE can be configured with a list of up to *M* *TCI-State*
configurations within the higher layer parameter *PDSCH-Config* to
decode PDSCH according to a detected PDCCH with DCI intended for the UE
and the given serving cell, where M depends on the UE capability
*maxNumberConfiguredTCIstatesPerCC*. Each *TCI-State* contains
parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one
or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the
DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The
quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer
parameter *qcl-Type1* for the first DL RS, and *qcl-Type2* for the
second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types
shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the
same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types
corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter
*qcl-Type* in *QCL-Info* and may take one of the following values:

\- \'typeA\': {Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay
spread}

\- \'typeB\': {Doppler shift, Doppler spread}

\- \'typeC\': {Doppler shift, average delay}

\- \'typeD\': {Spatial Rx parameter}

The UE can be configured with a list of up to *128* *TCI-State*
configurations, within the higher layer parameter
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* in *PDSCH-Config* for providing a reference
signal for the quasi co-location for DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH
in a BWP/CC, for CSI-RS, and to provide a reference, if applicable, for
determining UL TX spatial filter for dynamic-grant and configured-grant
based PUSCH and PUCCH resource in a BWP/CC, and SRS.

If the *TCI-State* or *TCI-UL-State* configurations are absent in a BWP
of the CC, the UE can apply the *TCI-State* or *TCI-UL-State*
configurations from a reference BWP of a reference CC. The UE is not
expected to be configured with *tci-StatesToAddModList*,
*SpatialRelationInfo* or *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, **except
*SpatialRelationInfoPos in a CC in a band*,** if the UE is configured
with *dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* or *ul-TCI-StateList* in any CC in the
same band. The UE can assume that when the UE is configured with
*tci-StatesToAddModList* in any CC in the CC list configured by
*simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1-r16, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2-r16,*
*simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1-r16, or
simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2-r16,* the UE is not configured with
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* or *ul-TCI-StateList* in any CC within the
same band in the CC list.

The UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.xx
of \[10, TS 38.321\], 6.1.3.47 of \[10, TS 38.321\] or 6.1.4.xx of \[10,
TS 38.321\], used to map up to 8 TCI states and/or pairs of TCI states,
with one TCI state for DL channels/signals and/or one TCI state for UL
channels/signals to the codepoints of the DCI field *\'Transmission
Configuration Indication\'* for one or for a set of CCs/DL BWPs,
\[and/\] or up to 8 sets of TCI states, where each set is comprised of
up to two TCI state(s) for DL and UL signals/channels, or up to two TCI
state(s) for DL channels/signals and up to two TCI state(s) for UL
channels/signals to the codepoints of the DCI field *\'Transmission
Configuration Indication\'* for one or for a set of CCs/DL BWPs, and if
applicable, for one or for a set of CCs/UL BWPs. When a set of TCI state
IDs are activated for a set of CCs/DL BWPs and if applicable, for a set
of CCs/UL BWPs, where the applicable list of CCs is determined by the
indicated CC in the activation command, the same set of TCI state IDs
are applied for all DL and/or UL BWPs in the indicated CCs. If the
activation command maps *TCI-State(s)* and/or *TCI-UL-State(s)* to only
one TCI codepoint, the UE shall apply the indicated *TCI-State(s)*
and/or *TCI-UL-State(s)* to one or to a set of CCs /DL BWPs, and if
applicable, to one or to a set of CCs /UL BWPs once the indicated
mapping for the one single TCI codepoint is applied as described in
\[11, TS 38.133\].

When the *bwp-id* or *cell* for QCL-TypeA/D source RS in a QCL-Info of
the TCI state is not configured, the UE assumes that QCL-TypeA/D source
RS is configured in the CC/DL BWP where TCI state applies.

When *tci-PresentInDCI* is set as \'enabled\' or *tci-PresentDCI-1-2* is
configured for the CORESET, a UE configured with
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* with activated *TCI-State* or
*ul-TCI-StateList* with activated *TCI-UL-State* receives DCI format
1\_1/1\_2/1\_3 providing indicated *TCI-State(s)* and/or
*TCI-UL-State(s)* for a CC or all CCs in the same CC list configured by
*simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList1-r17, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2-r17,
simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3-r17, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4-r17*.
The DCI format 1\_1/1\_2 can be with or without, if applicable, DL
assignment. If the DCI format 1\_1/1\_2/ is without DL assignment, the
UE can assume the following:

\- CS-RNTI is used to scramble the CRC for the DCI

\- The values of the following DCI fields are set as follows:

\- RV = all \'1\'s

\- MCS = all \'1\'s

\- NDI = 0

\- Set to all \'0\'s for FDRA Type 0, or all \'1\'s for FDRA Type 1, or
all \'0\'s for dynamicSwitch (same as in Table 10.2-4 of \[6, TS
38.213\]).

After a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* with more than one *TCI-State* and before
application of an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states:

\- The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH and the CSI-RS
applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH
block the UE identified during the initial access procedure

After a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* with more than one *TCI-State* or
*ul-TCI-StateList* with more than one *TCI-UL-State* and before
application of an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI states:

\- The UE assumes that the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for
dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS
applying the indicated TCI state, is the same as that for a PUSCH
transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant during the initial access
procedure

After a UE receives a higher layer configuration of
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* with more than one *TCI-State* as part of a
Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in \[12, TS 38.331\]
and before applying an indicated TCI state from the configured TCI
states:

\- The UE assumes that DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH, and the CSI-RS
applying the indicated TCI state are quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH
block or the CSI-RS resource the UE identified during the random access
procedure initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as
described in \[12, TS 38.331\].

After a UE receives a higher layer configuration of
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* with more than one *TCI-State* or more than
one *TCI-UL-State* as part of a Reconfiguration with sync procedure as
described in \[12, TS 38.331\] and before applying an indicated TCI
state from the configured TCI states:

\- The UE assumes that the UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, for
dynamic-grant and configured-grant based PUSCH and PUCCH, and for SRS
applying the indicated TCI state, is the same as that for a PUSCH
transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant during random access procedure
initiated by the Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in
\[12, TS 38.331\].

If a UE receives a higher layer configuration of
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* with a single *TCI-State*, that can be used as
an indicated TCI state*,* the UE obtains the QCL assumptions from the
configured TCI state for DM-RS of PDSCH and DM-RS of PDCCH, and the CSI
-RS applying the indicated TCI state.

If a UE receives a higher layer configuration of
*dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* with a single *TCI-State or ul-TCI-StateList*
with *a single TCI-UL-State*, that can be used as an indicated TCI
state, the UE determines an UL TX spatial filter, if applicable, from
the configured TCI state for dynamic-grant and configured-grant based
PUSCH and PUCCH, and SRS applying the indicated TCI state.

When a UE configured with *dl-OrJointTCI-StateList* would transmit a
PUCCH with positive HARQ-ACK or a PUSCH with positive HARQ-ACK
corresponding to the DCI carrying the TCI State indication and without
DL assignment, or corresponding to the PDSCH scheduled by the DCI
carrying the TCI State indication, and if the indicated TCI State(s)
is/are different from the previously indicated one*(s)*, the indicated
*TCI-State(s)* and/or *TCI-UL-State(s)* should be applied starting from
the first slot that is at least $\text{beamAppTime}$ symbols after the
last symbol of the PUCCH or the PUSCH. The first slot and the
$\text{beamAppTime}$ symbols are both determined on the active BWP with
the smallest SCS among the BWP(s) from the CCs applying the indicated
*TCI-State(s)* or *TCI-UL-State(s)* that are active at the end of the
PUCCH or the PUSCH carrying the positive HARQ-ACK.

If a UE is configured with *pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH*
in which one or more rows contain multiple *SLIV*s for PDSCH on a DL BWP
of a serving cell, and the UE is receiving a DCI carrying the
*TCI-State* indication and without DL assignment, the UE does not expect
that the number of indicated *SLIV*s in the row of **the**
*pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPDSCH* by the DCI **is** more
than one.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.1\]

The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell, which
maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes. Each HARQ process is
associated with a HARQ process identifier. The HARQ entity directs HARQ
information and associated TBs received on the DL-SCH to the
corresponding HARQ processes (see clause 5.3.2.2).

The number of parallel DL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in
TS 38.214 \[7\]. The dedicated broadcast HARQ process is used for BCCH.

The HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not
configured for downlink spatial multiplexing. The HARQ process supports
one or two TBs when the physical layer is configured for downlink
spatial multiplexing.

When the MAC entity is configured with *pdsch-AggregationFactor* \> 1,
the parameter *pdsch-AggregationFactor* provides the number of
transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the downlink assignment.
Bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking the same HARQ
process for each transmission that is part of the same bundle. After the
initial transmission, *pdsch-AggregationFactor* -- 1 HARQ
retransmissions follow within a bundle.

The MAC entity shall:

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated:

2\> allocate the TB(s) received from the physical layer and the
associated HARQ information to the HARQ process indicated by the
associated HARQ information.

1\> if a downlink assignment has been indicated for the broadcast HARQ
process:

2\> allocate the received TB to the broadcast HARQ process.

NOTE: It is up to UE implementation to allocate the received TB for MCCH
or broadcast MTCH to one HARQ process.

\[TS 38.321, clause 5.3.2.2\]

When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in
case of downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ
information are received from the HARQ entity.

For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process
shall:

1\> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of
the previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is
the first received transmission for the TB according to the system
information schedule indicated by RRC; or

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a MCCH-RNTI for MBS broadcast, and this is the first received
transmission for the TB according to the MCCH schedule indicated by RRC;
or

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a G-RNTI for MBS broadcast, and this is the first received transmission
for the TB according to the MTCH schedule indicated by RRC or according
to the scheduling indicated by DCI as specified in TS 38.214 \[7\]; or

1\> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e.
there is no previous NDI for this TB):

2\> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.

1\> else:

2\> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.

The MAC entity then shall:

1\> if this is a new transmission:

2\> attempt to decode the received data.

1\> else if this is a retransmission:

2\> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:

3\> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the
data currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the
combined data.

1\> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was
successfully decoded for this TB; or

1\> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:

2\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.

2\> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this
TB:

3\> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing
entity.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer
for this TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful
(see clause 5.1.5); or

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a MSGB-RNTI and the Random Access procedure is not yet successfully
completed (see clause 5.1.4a); or

1\> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI for MBS broadcast; or

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment for MBS
multicast and HARQ feedback is disabled for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, as
specified in clause 18 of TS 38.213 \[6\]; or

1\> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with
a G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment for MBS
multicast and NACK only HARQ feedback is configured for this G-RNTI or
G-CS-RNTI and the data for this TB is successfully decoded and the
transmission is not the first transmission of PDSCH where the configured
downlink assignment was (re-)initialised; or

1\> if the *timeAlignmentTimer*, associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped
or expired and if the *cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer*, if configured, is not
running; or

1\> if the HARQ process is configured with disabled HARQ feedback:

2\> if *harq-FeedbackEnablingforSPSactive* is configured with value
*true* and the transmission is the first transmission on the configured
downlink assignment after activation of the configured downlink
assignment:

3\> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the
data in this TB.

2\> else:

3\> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of
the data in this TB.

1\> else:

2\> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the
data in this TB.

The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on
PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its
C-RNTI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous
transmission.

NOTE: If the MAC entity receives a retransmission with a TB size
different from the last TB size signalled for this TB, the UE behavior
is left up to UE implementation.

\[TS 38.321, clause 6.1.3.47\]

The Unified TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is identified by a
MAC subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-1b. It has a
variable size consisting of following fields:

\- Serving Cell ID: This field indicates the identity of the Serving
Cell for which the MAC CE applies. The length of the field is 5 bits. If
the indicated Serving Cell is configured as part of a
*simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList1*, *simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2*,
*simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3* or *simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4* as
specified in TS 38.331 \[5\], this MAC CE applies to all theServing
Cells in the set *simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList1*,
*simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2*, *simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3* or
*simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4*, respectively;

\- DL BWP ID: This field indicates a DL BWP for which the MAC CE applies
as the codepoint of the DCI *bandwidth part indicator* field as
specified in TS 38.212 \[9\]. The length of the BWP ID field is 2 bits;

\- UL BWP ID: This field indicates a UL BWP for which the MAC CE applies
as the codepoint of the DCI *bandwidth part indicator* field as
specified in TS 38.212 \[9\]. If value of *unifiedTCI-StateType* in the
Serving Cell indicated by Serving Cell ID is *joint*, this field is
considered as the reserved bits. The length of the BWP ID field is 2
bits;

\- P~i~: This field indicates whether each TCI codepoint has multiple
TCI states or single TCI state. If P~i~ field is set to 1, it indicates
that i^th^ TCI codepoint includes the DL TCI state and the UL TCI state.
If P~i~ field is set to 0, it indicates that i^th^ TCI codepoint
includes only the DL/joint TCI state or the UL TCI state. The codepoint
to which a TCI state is mapped is determined by its ordinal position
among all the TCI state ID fields;

\- D/U: This field indicate whether the TCI state ID in the same octet
is for joint/downlink or uplink TCI state. If this field is set to 1,
the TCI state ID in the same octet is for joint/downlink. If this field
is set to 0, the TCI state ID in the same octet is for uplink;

\- TCI state ID: This field indicates the TCI state identified by
*TCI-StateId* as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\]. If D/U is set to 1,
7-bits length TCI state ID i.e. *TCI-StateId* as specified in TS 38.331
\[5\] is used. If D/U is set to 0, the most significant bit of TCI state
ID is considered as the reserved bit and remainder 6 bits indicate the
*TCI-UL-State-Id* as specified in TS 38.331 \[5\]. The maximum number of
activated TCI states is 16;

\- R: Reserved bit, set to 0.

specified in: TS 38.212 clause 7.3.1.0, 7.3.1.2.4 and T 38.213 clause
9.2.3 and 10.1.. Unless otherwise stated these are Rel-18 requirements.

\[TS 38.212, clause 7.3.1.0\]

Step 3:

\- If both of the following conditions are fulfilled the size alignment
procedure is complete

\- the total number of different DCI sizes configured to monitor is no
more than 4 for the cell

\- the total number of different DCI sizes with C-RNTI configured to
monitor is no more than 3 for the cell

Step 4:

\- Otherwise

Step 4A:

...

Step 4B:

...

Step 4C:

\- If the total number of different DCI sizes configured to monitor is
more than 4 for the cell after applying the above steps, or if the total
number of different DCI sizes with C-RNTI configured to monitor is more
than 3 for the cell after applying the above steps

\- If the number of information bits in the DCI format 0\_1 prior to
padding is less than the payload size of the DCI format 1\_1 for
scheduling the same serving cell, a number of zero padding bits are
generated for the DCI format 0\_1 until the payload size equals that of
the DCI format 1\_1.

\- If the number of information bits in the DCI format 1\_1 prior to
padding is less than the payload size of the DCI format 0\_1 for
scheduling the same serving cell, zeros shall be appended to the DCI
format 1\_1 until the payload size equals that of the DCI format 0\_1.

\[TS 38.212, clause 7.3.1.2.4\]

DCI format 1\_3 is used for the scheduling of one PDSCH in one cell, or
multiple PDSCHs in multiple cells with one PDSCH per cell.

The following information is transmitted by means of the DCI format 1\_3
with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI:

\- Identifier for DCI formats - 1 bits

\- The value of this bit field is always set to 1, indicating a DL DCI
format

\- Scheduled cell set indicator -
$\left\lceil \log_{2}N_{\text{set}} \right\rceil\ $bits, where
$N_{\text{set}}$ is the number of cell sets which are configured by
higher layer parameter *MC-DCI-SetofCellsToAddModList* to be
respectively scheduled by DCI format 0\_3/1\_3 from the cell on which
this format is carried by PDCCH. If present, this field is used to
indicate the scheduled cell set according to Table 7.3.1.1.4-1;
otherwise, the scheduled cell set is the cell set configured to be
scheduled by DCI format 0\_3/1\_3 from the cell by higher layer
parameter *MC-DCI-SetofCellsToAddModList*.

\- Scheduled cells indicator - number of bits determined by the
following:

\- 0 bit if the higher layer parameter *scheduledCellComboListDCI-1-3*
for the scheduled cell set is not configured;

...

\- Bandwidth part indicator - 0, 1 or 2 bits determined as
$\left\lceil \log_{2}n_{BWP,\ max} \right\rceil$, where

\- $n_{BWP,\ max} = n_{BWP,RRC}^{\max} + 1$ if
$n_{BWP,RRC}^{\max} \leq 3$, $n_{BWP,RRC}^{\max}\ $is the maximum number
of DL BWPs configured by higher layers, excluding the initial DL
bandwidth part, across all the cells configured by higher layer
parameter *scheduledCellListDCI-1-3* in the scheduled cell set, in which
case the bandwidth part indicator is equivalent to the ascending order
of the higher layer parameter *BWP-Id*;

\- otherwise $n_{BWP,\ max} = n_{BWP,RRC}^{\max}$, in which case the
bandwidth part indicator is defined in Table 7.3.1.1.2-1;

> The field is only applicable to a scheduled cell with the number of
> configured DL BWPs larger than 1, including the initial DL bandwidth
> part, and is applied to the applicable scheduled cells in the
> scheduled cell set independently. If a UE does not support active BWP
> change via DCI, the UE ignores this bit field. If this field indicates
> a code point that does not correspond to a configured BWP of a
> scheduled cell, the UE ignores this bit field for the scheduled cell,
> and operates on the active BWP of the scheduled cell.

\- Frequency domain resource assignment - number of bits determined by
the following:

\- block number 1, block number 2,..., block number
$N_{\text{cell}}^{\text{DL}}$

> If *scheduledCellComboListDCI-1-3* for the scheduled cell set is
> configured with more than one entry, $N_{\text{cell}}^{\text{DL}}$ is
> the number of scheduled cells indicated by Scheduled cells indicator
> field; if *scheduledCellComboListDCI-1-3* for the scheduled cell set
> is configured with only one entry,$\ N_{\text{cell}}^{\text{DL}}$ is
> the number of cells configured by higher layer parameter
> *scheduledCellComboListDCI-1-3*; otherwise,
> $N_{\text{cell}}^{\text{DL}}$ is the number of cells in the scheduled
> cell set configured by higher layer parameter
> *scheduledCellListDCI-1-3*. Each block corresponds to the frequency
> domain resource assignment for a cell, and the blocks are placed
> according to an ascending order of a serving cell index, with block
> number 1 corresponding to the frequency domain resource assignment for
> the cell with the smallest serving cell index. Each block is defined
> by the following fields:

\- $N_{\text{RBG}}$ bits if only resource allocation type 0 is
configured, where $N_{\text{RBG}}$ is defined in Clause 5.1.2.2.1 of
\[6, TS 38.214\]

\-
$\left\lceil \log_{2}\left( N_{RBG,\ K2}\left( N_{RBG,\ K2} + 1 \right)/2 \right) \right\rceil$
bits if only resource allocation type 1 is configured, or
$\max\left( \ \left\lceil \log_{2}\left( N_{RBG,\ K2}\left( N_{RBG,\ K2} + 1 \right)/2 \right) \right\rceil,\ N_{\text{RBG}} \right) + 1$
bits if *resourceAllocationDCI-1-3* is configured as
\'*dynamicSwitch\'*, where
$N_{RBG,\ K2} = \left\lceil \left( N_{\text{RB}}^{DL,\ BWP} + \left( N_{DL,\ BWP}^{\text{start}}\text{mod}{K2} \right) \right)/K2 \right\rceil,$
$N_{\text{RB}}^{DL,\ BWP}$ is the size of the active DL bandwidth part,
$N_{DL,\ BWP}^{\text{start}}$ is defined as in clause 4.4.4.4 of \[4, TS
38.211\] and $K2$ is given by higher layer parameter
*resourceAllocationType1GranularityDCI-1-3.* If the higher layer
parameter *resourceAllocationType1GranularityDCI-1-3* is not configured,
