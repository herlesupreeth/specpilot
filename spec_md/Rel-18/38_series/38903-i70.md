Introduction
============

FFS

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies a general method used to derive
Measurement Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for UE conformance tests.
The acceptable uncertainties for each test case are documented and
establish a system for relating the Test Tolerances to the measurement
uncertainties of the Test System.

For UE radio transmitting and reception tests, only FR2 is considered in
this document. For UE RRM and Demodulation tests, both FR1 and FR2 are
considered in this document.

The test cases which have been analysed to determine Test Tolerances are
included as .zip files.

The present document is applicable from Release 15 up to the release
indicated on the front page of the present Terminal conformance
specifications.

4 General Principles
====================

4.1 Principle of Superposition
------------------------------

For multi-cell tests there are several cells each generating various
Physical channels. In general cells are combined along with AWGN, so the
signal and noise seen by the UE may be determined by more than one cell.

Since several cells may contribute towards the overall power applied to
the UE, a number of test system uncertainties affect the signal and
noise seen by the UE. The aim of the superposition method is to vary
each controllable parameter of the test system separately, and to
establish its effect on the critical parameters as seen by the UE
receiver. The superposition principle then allows the effect of each
test system uncertainty to be added, to calculate the overall effect.

The contributing test system uncertainties shall form a minimum set for
the superposition principle to be applicable.

4.2 Sensitivity analysis
------------------------

A change in any one channel level or channel ratio generated at source
does not necessarily have a 1:1 effect at the UE. The effect of each
controllable parameter of the test system on the critical parameters as
seen by the UE receiver shall therefore be established. As a consequence
of the sensitivity scaling factors not necessarily being unity, the test
system uncertainties cannot be directly applied as test tolerances to
the critical parameters as seen by the UE.

EXAMPLE: In many of the tests described, the Ês / I~ot~ is one of the
critical parameters at the UE. Scaling factors are used to model the
sensitivity of the Ês / I~ot~ to each test system uncertainty. When the
scaling factors have been determined, the superposition principle then
allows the effect of each test system uncertainty to be added, to give
the overall variability in the critical parameters as seen at the UE.

There are often constraints on several parameters at the UE. The aim of
the sensitivity analysis, together with the acceptable test system
uncertainties, is to ensure that the variability in each of these
parameters is controlled within the limits necessary for the
specification to apply. The test has then been conducted under valid
conditions.

4.3 Statistical combination of uncertainties
--------------------------------------------

The acceptable uncertainties of the test system are specified as the
measurement uncertainty tolerance interval for a specific measurement
that contains 95 % of the performance of a population of test equipment.
In the RRM and UE radio transmission and reception conformance tests
covered by the present document, the Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
range, with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.

The method given in the present document combines the acceptable
uncertainties of the test system, to give the overall variability in the
critical parameters as seen at the UE. Since the process does not add
any new uncertainties, the method of combination should be chosen to
maintain the same tolerance interval for the combined uncertainty as is
already specified for the contributing test system uncertainties.

The basic principle for combining uncertainties is in accordance with
ETR 273-1-2 \[4\]. In summary, the process requires 3 steps:

a\) Express the value of each contributing uncertainty as a one standard
deviation figure, from knowledge of its numeric value and its
distribution.

b\) Combine all the one standard deviation figures as root-sum-squares,
to give the one standard deviation value for the combined uncertainty.

c\) Expand the combined uncertainty by a coverage factor, according to
the tolerance interval required.

Provided that the contributing uncertainties have already been obtained
using this method, using a coverage factor of 2, further stages of
combination can be achieved by performing step b) alone, since steps a)
and c) simply divide by 2 and multiply by 2 respectively.

The root-sum-squares method is therefore used to maintain the same
tolerance interval for the combined uncertainty as is already specified
for the contributing test system uncertainties. In some cases where
correlation between contributing uncertainties has an adverse effect,
the method is modified in accordance with clause 4.4.5 of the present
document.

In each analysis, the uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated, and
are added result root-sum-square unless otherwise stated.

The combination of uncertainties is performed using dB values for
simplicity. It has been shown that using dB uncertainty values gives a
slightly worse combined uncertainty result than using linear values for
the uncertainties. The analysis method therefore errs on the safe side.

4.4 Correlation between uncertainties
-------------------------------------

The statistical (root-sum-square) addition of uncertainties is based on
the assumption that the uncertainties are independent of each other. For
realisable test systems, the uncertainties may not be fully independent.
The validity of the method used to add uncertainties depends on both the
type of correlation and on the way in which the uncertainties affect the
test requirements.

Clauses 4.4.1 to 4.4.3 give examples to illustrate different types of
correlation.

Clauses 4.4.4 to 4.4.7 show how the scenarios applicable to multi-cell
RRM tests are treated.

### 4.4.1 Uncorrelated uncertainties

The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B,
which affect a test requirement. Each sample from a population of test
systems has a specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific
value of error in parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample
from a population of test systems, and is plotted according to its error
values for parameters A and B.

Figure 4.4.1-1: Example of two test system uncertainties affecting a
test requirement

It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for
example, is equally likely to occur with either a positive or a negative
value of error in parameter B. This is expected when two parameters are
uncorrelated, such as two uncertainties which arise from different and
unrelated parts of the test system.

### 4.4.2 Positively correlated uncertainties

The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B,
which affect a test requirement. Each sample from a population of test
systems has a specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific
value of error in parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample
from a population of test systems, and is plotted according to its error
values for parameters A and B.

Figure 4.4.2-1: Example of two test system uncertainties affecting a
test requirement

It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for
example, is more likely to occur with a positive value of error in
parameter B and less likely to occur with a negative value of error in
parameter B. This can occur when the two uncertainties arise from
similar parts of the test system, or when one component of the
uncertainty affects both parameters in a similar way.

In an extreme case, if the error in parameter A and the error in
parameter B came from the same sources of uncertainty, and no others,
the dots would lie on a straight line of slope +1.

### 4.4.3 Negatively correlated uncertainties

The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B,
which affect a test condition. Each sample from a population of test
systems has a specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific
value of error in parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample
from a population of test systems, and is plotted according to its error
values for parameters A and B.

Figure 4.4.3-1: Example of two test system uncertainties affecting a
test condition

It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for
example, is more likely to occur with a negative value of error in
parameter B and less likely to occur with a positive value of error in
parameter B. This effect can theoretically occur, and is included for
completeness, but is unlikely in a practical test system.

### 4.4.4 Treatment of uncorrelated uncertainties

If two uncertainties are uncorrelated, they are added statistically in
the analysis. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed as an
expanded uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the contributing
uncertainties are added root-sum-squares to give a combined uncertainty
which also has coverage factor 2, and the 95% tolerance interval is
maintained.

This is the default assumption.

### 4.4.5 Treatment of positively correlated uncertainties with adverse effect

If two test system uncertainties are positively correlated, and if they
affect the value of a critical parameter in the same direction, the
combined effect may be greater than predicted by adding the contributing
uncertainties root-sum-squares.

In this scenario the two uncertainties are added worst-case in the
analysis. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed as an
expanded uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the combined uncertainty
will cover a 95% tolerance interval even when the two contributing
uncertainties are fully correlated. If the two contributing
uncertainties are less than fully correlated, the combined uncertainty
will cover a tolerance interval greater than 95%.

### 4.4.6 Treatment of positively correlated uncertainties with beneficial effect

If two test system uncertainties are positively correlated, and if they
affect the value of a critical parameter in opposite directions, the
combined effect will be less than predicted by adding the contributing
uncertainties root-sum-squares.

In this scenario the two uncertainties are added statistically in the
analysis. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed as an
expanded uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the combined uncertainty
will cover a 95% tolerance interval when the two contributing
uncertainties are uncorrelated. If the two contributing uncertainties
are positively correlated, the combined uncertainty will cover a
tolerance interval greater than 95%.

### 4.4.7 Treatment of negatively correlated uncertainties

Negatively correlated uncertainties are excluded by the assumptions.
This has been agreed as an acceptable restriction on practical test
systems, as the mechanisms which produce correlation generally arise
from similarities between two parts of the test system, and therefore
produce positive correlation.

5 Determination of Test System Uncertainties
============================================

5.1 General
-----------

The uncertainty of a test system when making measurements reduces the
ability of the test system to distinguish between conformant and
non-conformant test subjects. The aim is therefore to minimise
uncertainty, subject to a number of practical constraints:

a\) A vendor\'s test system should be reproducible in the required
quantities.

b\) A choice of test systems should be available from different vendors.

c\) The uncertainties should allow reasonable freedom of test system
implementation

d\) The test system can be run automatically

e\) The test system may include several radio access technologies

f\) It should be possible to maintain calibration of deployed test
systems over reasonable spans of time and environmental conditions

In practice therefore within 3GPP the acceptable uncertainty of the test
system is the smallest value that can be agreed between the test system
vendors represented, consistent with the above constraints. The
uncertainty will not therefore be as low as could be achieved, for
example, by a national standards laboratory.

5.2 Uncertainty figures
-----------------------

The actual figures for the acceptable uncertainty of a test system are
defined in Annex F of 38.521-1, Annex F of 38.521-2, Annex F of
38.521-3, Annex F of TS 38.521-4, Annex F of TS 38.533 and Annex C of
37.571-1. To avoid maintenance issues with figures in separate
specifications, the uncertainties are not formally defined within the
present document, but informative guidelines are provided in Annex B to
Annex E of the present document.

6 Determination of Test Tolerances
==================================

6.1 General
-----------

The general principles given in the present document are applied to each
test case, according to the applicable uncertainties and requirements to
obtain a correct verdict.

The test cases which have been analysed to determine Test Tolerances are
included the present document as .zip files. The name of the zip file
indicates the specification and the test cases covered.

Annex A gives the rationale for their inclusion.

########  Annex A: Derivation documents for test tolerance

The documents (and spreadsheets where applicable) used to derive the
test tolerances for each test case are included in the present document
as zip files.

The aim is to provide a reference to completed test cases, so that test
tolerances for similar test cases can be derived on a common basis. The
information on test case grouping in clauses 7 and 8 can be used to
identify similarities.

A.1 Void
========

A.2 Handling of common Test Tolerance topics for radiated test cases defined in TS 38.533
=========================================================================================

The basic principles of Test Tolerance analysis are the same for
conducted testing and radiated testing, but for radiated testing
additional topics are taken into account. This annex contains methods to
handle common additional topics, to allow re-use and to avoid the need
for each test case analysis to repeat the same detail.

Individual test case analyses are expected to follow the methods
contained here where applicable, and to refer to relevant clauses in
this Annex.

A.2.1 Angles of Arrival
-----------------------

### A.2.1.1 Relevant core requirements

In FR2, the performance of the UE depends on the downlink signal angle
of arrival, and is characterised by two parameters:

\- Refsens: lowest signal level for a given demodulation performance in
the UE Rx beam peak direction, specified in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] clause
7.3.2 according to UE Power class, Channel bandwidth and operating band

\- EIS spherical coverage: lowest signal level for a given demodulation
performance in a specified percentile of other directions, specified in
TS 38.101-2 \[16\] clause 7.3.4 according to UE Power class, Channel
bandwidth and operating band

As both of these requirements are defined in the context of a throughput
requirement, the UE is assumed to be using fine beams. Note that for
directions outside the specified percentile of spherical coverage
directions, there are no requirements. Testing must therefore be carried
out within the spherical coverage directions. For testing, direction is
3-dimensional, but the principle can be illustrated in a 2-dimensional
diagram:

![](./media/image6.png){width="2.9375in" height="1.6458333333333333in"}

Figure A.2.1.1-1: UE Rx Beam-peak and spherical coverage directions,
Fine beams

### A.2.1.2 Modelling of variation within spherical coverage directions

Within the spherical coverage directions, a signal may be anywhere from
near Rx Beam Peak (high gain direction, close to Refsens) to the worst
of the allowed percentile (low gain direction, close to EIS spherical
coverage requirement value). This is modelled by taking the midpoint of
the Spherical coverage range as the nominal value, and then adding a
variation of ±(half the difference between Refsens and Spherical
coverage).

UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint in dB is derived as (UE Refsens - UE
Spherical coverage)/2

Figure A.2.1.2-1 shows an example for UE Power class 3, Channel
bandwidth 100MHz and operating band n257. In this example the UE
Spherical coverage gain midpoint would be -5.45dB, as the gain is lower
than in the Rx Beam peak direction. Variation about the midpoint is
handled as a UE uncertainty.

![](./media/image7.png){width="3.21875in" height="3.28125in"}

Figure A.2.1.2-1: Example modelling of variation within spherical
coverage directions, Fine beams

### A.2.1.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis 

The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:

\- The Angle of Arrival for each downlink signal shall be defined:
either from UE Rx beam peak direction or from a direction within the EIS
spherical coverage

\- Variations over the EIS spherical coverage directions shall be
included, using the method shown in A.2.1.2.

Variations over the EIS spherical coverage directions do not directly
affect signals applied to the UE, but they do affect the SS-RSRP level
measured by the UE, and the Es/Iot at UE baseband. Where the test case
has requirements on UE baseband Es/Iot~BB~, UE internal noise
calculation is given in clause A.2.3, and calculation of Es/Iot at UE
baseband is given in clauses A.2.4 and A.2.7.

A.2.2 UE Fine beams and Rough beams
-----------------------------------

### A.2.2.1 Relevant core requirements

UE requirements such as Refsens in TS 38.101-2 \[16\], assume that the
UE is using a fine beam which has higher antenna gain to give good
demodulation performance. However, in some RRM scenarios where the UE is
for example searching for or measuring other cells, the UE uses rough
beams which have lower antenna gain. The difference in gain is specified
depending on the Angle of Arrival:

\- The Gain difference Y between fine and rough beams in the UE Rx beam
peak direction is specified in TS 38.133 \[17\] Table B.2.1.3.1-1
according to UE Power class

\- The Gain difference Z between fine and rough beams in the UE
Spherical coverage directions is specified in TS 38.133 \[17\] Table
B.2.1.3.2-1 according to UE Power class

The Gain differences Y and Z are not dependent on Channel bandwidth or
operating band. The concept is illustrated in Figures A.2.2.1-1 and
A.2.2.1-2.

![](./media/image8.png){width="3.78125in" height="1.5625in"}

Figure A.2.2.1-1: Fine and rough beams, Rx Beam peak direction

![](./media/image9.png){width="3.78125in" height="1.6458333333333333in"}

Figure A.2.2.1-2: Fine and rough beams, spherical coverage directions

When the *Rx Beam Peak is selected and defined based on Fine Beams, the
rough beam gain in that direction may be lower than the largest rough
beam gain in another direction within Spherical Coverage.* The term "D"
is the maximum allowed rough beam gain reduction and is specified in TS
38.133 \[17\] Table B.2.1.5.3-1 for each power class. D parameter is
applicable only to RSRP relative accuracy test cases.

Figure A.2.2.1-3: Fine and rough beams alignment, Rx Beam peak direction

### A.2.2.2 Modelling of Fine beams and Rough beams

Where the UE is assumed to use fine beams, the scenario is already
covered in the Refsens and EIS spherical coverage requirements, and no
further modifications are needed.

Where the UE is assumed to use rough beams, the effect is modelled as a
reduction in gain of YdB or ZdB, according to the Angle of Arrival of
each downlink signal. The reduction in gain translates to a higher UE
internal noise seen at the Reference point where the downlink signals
are applied. UE noise calculated from Refsens or from EIS spherical
coverage requirements is increased by YdB or ZdB respectively. UE
internal noise calculation is given in clause A.2.3.

### A.2.2.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis 

The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:

\- The Type of beam assumed to be used by the UE for each downlink
signal shall be defined: either Fine Beam or Rough Beam

\- Where UE internal noise is relevant, and the UE is assumed to be
using Rough Beams, it is increased by the value of Y or Z, selected
according to UE Power class and Angle of Arrival.

UE internal noise calculation is given in clause A.2.3.

A.2.3 UE internal noise
-----------------------

### A.2.3.1 Relevant core requirements

The relevant Core requirements are:

\- Refsens or EIS spherical coverage, specified in TS 38.101-2 \[16\]
clauses 7.3.2 and 7.3.4 respectively

\- UE baseband SNR at which Refsens or EIS spherical coverage is
specified, in TS 38.133 \[17\] clause B.2.1.3

\- N~RB~ in channel BW at which Refsens or EIS spherical coverage is
specified, in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table 5.3.2-1

\- Gain difference between fine and rough beams, in TS 38.133 \[17\]
clause B.2.1.3

\- UE multi-band relaxation factors, in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table
6.2.1.3-4

### A.2.3.2 Calculation method

For signals arriving from Rx Beam Peak direction:

Noise in dBm/SCS = Refsens ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ -- SNR~Refsens~
-10Log~10~ (N~RB\_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ x 12) +Y ~PC~ + ΣMB~P~

*where:*

Refsens ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ is the reference sensitivity value in dBm
specified in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] clause 7.3.2 according to Power Class,
Operating band and Channel bandwidth

SNR~Refsens~ is the SNR used for simulation of Refsens and EIS spherical
coverage, and is -1 dB

N~RB\_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ is the number of PRBs specified in TS 38.101-2
\[16\] Table 5.3.2-1 according to Channel bandwidth and subcarrier
spacing (not necessarily equal to the number of PRBs used in the test
case)

12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB

Y ~PC~ is the gain difference in dB specified in TS 38.133 \[17\] Table
B.2.1.3.1-1, according to Power Class, and is only applied when the UE
is assumed to be using rough beams. Otherwise, use 0dB.

ΣMB~P~ is the UE multi-band relaxation factor value in dB specified in
TS 38.101-2 \[16\] clause 6.2.1

For signals arriving from Spherical coverage directions:

Noise in dBm/SCS = EIS spherical coverage ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ --
SNR~Refsens~ -10Log~10~ (N~RB\_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ x 12) +Z ~PC~ + ΣMB~S~

*where:*

EIS spherical coverage ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ is the EIS spherical
coverage value in dBm specified in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] clause 7.3.4
according to Power Class, Operating band and Channel bandwidth

SNR~Refsens~ is the SNR used for simulation of Refsens and EIS spherical
coverage, and is -1 dB

N~RB\_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ is the number of PRBs specified in TS 38.101-2
\[16\] Table 5.3.2-1 according to Channel bandwidth and subcarrier
spacing (not necessarily equal to the number of PRBs used in the test
case)

12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB

Z ~PC~ is the gain difference in dB specified in TS 38.133 \[17\] Table
B.2.1.3.2-1, according to Power Class, and is only applied when the UE
is assumed to be using rough beams. Otherwise, use 0dB.

ΣMB~S~ is the UE multi-band relaxation factor value in dB specified in
TS 38.101-2 \[16\] clause 6.2.1

The analysis spreadsheet converts dBm/SCS to linear power in pW/SCS for
ease of further calculations.

### A.2.3.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis

The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:

\- Where the test case has requirements on UE baseband Es/Iot~BB~, the
Test Tolerance analysis should include UE internal noise in the
calculation

\- UE internal noise is calculated using the method in A.2.3.2

A.2.4 Calculation of Es/Iot at UE baseband
------------------------------------------

### A.2.4.1 Relevant core requirements

Core requirements applicable to RRM test cases depend on the test
purpose, and should be selected for each test case. For test cases where
the UE makes a measurement, the following are relevant:

\- Measurement Performance requirements are specified in TS 38.133
\[17\] clause 10, and side conditions such as Es/Iot are included in the
core requirements for each measurement. For FR2, notes in tables clarify
that Es/Iot is at UE baseband.

\- Operating band specific conditions for RRM requirements are specified
in TS 38.133 \[17\] Annex B, and side conditions such as Es/Iot are
included for each measurement. For FR2, notes in tables clarify that
Es/Iot is at UE baseband.

Other UE core requirements may also have conditions on Es/Iot.

### A.2.4.2 Calculation method

An example is provided here for a scenario with applied AWGN and two
intra-frequency cells. SSB Es/Iot at UE baseband is calculated for Cell
1. Interference to Cell 1 comes from the applied AWGN, from the UE
internal noise, and from Cell 2. The values are chosen for illustration,
and not taken from any specific test case.

Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~ ((Cell 1 SSB power) / (Applied AWGN
power + UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power))

*Where* Applied AWGN power, UE internal noise, Cell 1 power and Cell 2
power are linear powers in W, per subcarrier.

![](./media/image11.png){width="4.572916666666667in" height="1.71875in"}

Figure A.2.4.2-1: Example Es/Iot~BB~ scenario, applied AWGN and two
intra-frequency cells

*In this case, the calculation gives* Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~
(0.139 / (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = **-0.67dB**

The main point is that the Es/Iot at UE baseband is lower than the
applied Es/Iot, because the UE internal noise adds to the interference,
and can be a significant contribution for the parameters used in some
test cases.

The presence of UE internal noise also affects the calculation of Es/Iot
sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis. The UE internal
noise is a fixed (worst) value, being based on the UE minimum
requirement, and is taken into account in the scaling which uses linear
powers:

\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to applied AWGN absolute power = UE
internal noise /(Applied AWGN power + UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB
power). In this example, (0.037 / (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = **+0.230**

\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 1 Es/Noc = **+1.000**

\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 2 Es/Noc = -Cell 2 SSB
power /(Applied AWGN power + UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power). In
this example, (0.070 / (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = -**0.429**

A positive sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for example increasing
Cell 1 Es/Noc. A negative sensitivity factor is used where an increase
in the quantity produces a decrease in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for
example increasing Cell 2 Es/Noc. The sensitivity factors are used to
scale the uncertainties.

Where the uncertainties are uncorrelated, as here, they are added
root-sum-square so the sign of the sensitivity factor does not have any
effect. In special cases where the uncertainties are correlated, they
may be added arithmetically and the sign affects the result, as in
clause A.2.7.

### A.2.4.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis 

The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:

\- UE internal noise is included in the interference when calculating
Es/Iot~BB~

\- Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in
A.2.4.2

A.2.5 Calculation of Applied Io
-------------------------------

### A.2.5.1 Relevant core requirements

Core requirements applicable to RRM test cases depend on the test
purpose, and should be selected for each test case. For test cases where
the UE makes a measurement, the following are relevant:

\- Measurement Performance requirements are specified in TS 38.133
\[17\] clause 10, and side conditions such as Io are included in the
core requirements for each measurement. Normally the maximum Io
condition is specified in the channel bandwidth, whereas the minimum Io
condition is specified as a power density per subcarrier.

### A.2.5.2 Calculation method

An example is provided here for a scenario with applied AWGN and two
intra-frequency cells. Io applied to the UE is the arithmetic sum of
linear powers in the channel bandwidth. UE internal noise is not
counted, as it is not applied to the UE. The values are chosen for
illustration, and not taken from any specific test case.

Channel Io = 10Log~10~ (Applied AWGN power + Cell 1 power + Cell 2
power) + 10Log~10~ (N~RB\_TC~ x 12)

*where:*

AWGN, Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear powers in W, per
subcarrier

N~RB\_TC~ is the number of PRBs allocated in the test case (not
necessarily equal to the number of PRBs in the channel bandwidth)

12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB

![](./media/image12.png){width="4.5625in" height="1.3541666666666667in"}

Figure A.2.5.2-1: Example Io scenario, applied AWGN and two
intra-frequency cells

*With 24 PRBs allocated, the example gives* Io = 10Log~10~ ((0.055
+0.139 +0.070) x10^-9^)+10Log~10~ (24 x 12) = **-71.2dBm**

Io sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis are based on
linear powers:

\- Io sensitivity to applied AWGN absolute power = **+1.000**

\- Io sensitivity to Cell 1 Es/Noc = Cell 1 power / (Applied AWGN power
+ Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power). In this example, (0.139 / (0.055 + 0.139
+ 0.070)) = **+0.527**

\- Io sensitivity to Cell 2 Es/Noc = Cell 2 power / (Applied AWGN power
+ Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power). In this example, (0.070 / (0.055 + 0.139
+ 0.070)) = +**0.264**

All the sensitivity factors are positive, as an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Io. The sensitivity factors are used to scale
the uncertainties.

### A.2.5.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis 

The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:

\- Io is calculated using the method in A.2.5.2

\- Io sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in A.2.5.2

A.2.6 UE Reported RSRP and UE gain
----------------------------------

### A.2.6.1 Relevant core requirements

*SS-RSRP is defined to be measured based on the combined signal from
antenna elements corresponding to a given receiver branch.* The
reference point for requirement parameters from the UE perspective is
the input of the UE antenna array. The UE gain "G" relates the *combined
signal from antenna elements corresponding to a given receiver branch to
the* reference point for requirement parameters.

For test cases where the UE reports a measured value, or compares a
measured value to a signalled threshold, the UE Gain "G" affects the
SS-RSRP level measured by the UE

\- The UE Gain from the reference point (where test case parameters are
specified) to the SS-RSRP measurement point is specified in TS 38.133
\[17\] clause B.2.1.5. As the UE gain "G" is specified for Rx Beam Peak
angle of arrival, it does not include effects related to spherical
coverage.

\- Measurement Performance requirements are specified in TS 38.133
\[17\] clause 10, and include accuracy requirements as +/-dB values. For
FR2, the accuracy is considered to apply at the *combined signal from
antenna elements corresponding to a given receiver branch, and* does not
include the UE gain "G".

The specified range of UE Gain "G" allows the UE to use either Rough
beams or Fine beams, so no further allowance is required for the
parameters Y or Z in A.2.2.

In any specific direction, the UE gain G may be different depending on
frequencies. The UE gain difference between inter-frequencies "Ginter"
affects relative signal level values reported by the UE when measuring
between different frequencies and is specified in TS 38.133 \[17\] Table
B.2.1.5.2-1 for each power class. Ginter parameter is applicable only to
RSRP relative accuracy test cases.

### A.2.6.2 Absolute RSRP

An example is provided here for a scenario where the UE reports SS-RSRP
for a signal arriving from a direction within the UE spherical coverage,
to illustrate variation from both UE spherical coverage and variation
from UE gain "G".

UE-measured SS-RSRP~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

*where:*

Applied SSB\_RP is specified in the test case, either directly as Es or
derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and is in dBm per subcarrier

UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint in dB is derived as (UE Refsens - UE
Spherical coverage)/2

UE gain G midpoint in dB is derived as (Min value of G + Max value of
G)/2

*As an example for a UE power class 3 in band n257, measuring SS\_RSRP
from a spherical coverage direction,* UE-measured SS-RSRP~nom~ = Applied
SSB\_RP -5.45dB +5.0dB.

Figure A.2.1.2-1 shows the derivation of UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint. Variation about the midpoint is handled as a UE uncertainty.
For signals arriving from Rx Beam Peak direction, this gain is 0dB and
does not vary.

Figure A.2.6.2-1 shows the derivation of UE gain G midpoint. Variation
about the midpoint is handled as a UE uncertainty.

![](./media/image13.png){width="3.3541666666666665in" height="2.5625in"}

Figure A.2.6.2-1: Example modelling of UE Gain "G" variation

To calculate the range of valid SS-RSRP values that can be reported by
the UE, contributions from Spherical coverage gain variation, UE gain
variation and UE reporting accuracy are considered:

![](./media/image14.png){width="6.71875in"
height="2.8541666666666665in"}

Figure A.2.6.2-2: modelling of contributions affecting SS-RSRP reported
values

Reported SS-RSRP = UE measured SS-RSRP~nom~ ±Spherical coverage gain
variation ±UE gain variation ±UE accuracy

*where:*

UE measured SS-RSRP~nom~ is the nominal value derived from Applied
SSB\_RP, UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE gain G midpoint

Spherical coverage gain variation is derived from Refsens and Spherical
coverage, as shown in Figure A.2.1.2-1

UE gain variation is derived from Minimum and maximum values of G, as
shown in Figure A.2.6.2-1

UE accuracy is the absolute accuracy from the core requirement referred
to in A.2.6.1

*As an example for a UE power class 3 in band n257, measuring SS\_RSRP
from a spherical coverage direction with applied Io \> -70dBm, the
variation would be (*±5.45dB ±15dB ±8dB) = **±28.45dB**

These variations are added arithmetically in the test case analysis, as
each could be systematic and not random. For signals arriving from Rx
Beam Peak direction, spherical coverage gain variation is 0dB.

### A.2.6.3 Relative RSRP, 2 levels on same cell, same Angle of Arrival

An example is provided here for a scenario where the test case require
the UE to report SS-RSRP for the same cell at two different levels, with
the signal arriving from the same direction. The Angle of Arrival may be
within the UE spherical coverage, or from Rx Beam peak direction.

UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage
gain midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2 + UE Spherical coverage
gain midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2
- Applied SSB\_RP1

*where:*

Applied SSB\_RP1 and Applied SSB\_RP2 are specified in the test case,
either directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm per
subcarrier

*It can be seen that* UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE gain G
midpoint cancel out for this relative measurement, as they remain the
same for a signal from the same Angle of Arrival.

Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ -
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±UE accuracy

*where:*

UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred
to in A.2.6.1

### A.2.6.4 Relative RSRP, 2 intra-frequency cells, same Angle of Arrival

An example is provided here for a scenario where the test case require
the UE to report SS-RSRP for two different cells, with the signals
arriving from the same direction. The Angle of Arrival may be within the
UE spherical coverage, or from Rx Beam peak direction.

UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage
gain midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2 + UE Spherical coverage
gain midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2
- Applied SSB\_RP1

*where:*

Applied SSB\_RP1 and Applied SSB\_RP2 are specified in the test case,
either directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm per
subcarrier

*It can be seen that* UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE gain G
midpoint cancel out for this relative measurement, as they are the same
for signals from the same Angle of Arrival.

Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ -
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±UE accuracy

*where:*

UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred
to in A.2.6.1

### A.2.6.5 Relative RSRP, 2 inter-frequency cells, same Angle of Arrival

\[FFS\]

### A.2.6.6 Relative RSRP, 2 cells, different Angles of Arrival

Examples are provided here for scenarios where the test case requires
the UE to report SS-RSRP for two different cells, with the signals
arriving from different directions.

For both Angles of Arrival from UE spherical coverage directions:

UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage
gain midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2 + UE Spherical coverage
gain midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2
- Applied SSB\_RP1

*where:*

> Applied SSB\_RP1 and Applied SSB\_RP2 are specified in the test case,
> either directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm
> per subcarrier

*For the nominal values,* UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE
gain G midpoint cancel out for this relative measurement. For the
variations, UE gain variation cancels out as the same value affects both
cells, but Spherical coverage gain variation applies separately to each
Angle of Arrival.

Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ -
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~
±Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA2~ ±UE accuracy

*where:*

Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~ is derived from Refsens and
Spherical coverage, as in Figure A.2.1.2-1

Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA2~ is derived from Refsens and
Spherical coverage, as in Figure A.2.1.2-1

UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred
to in A.2.6.1

For one Angle of Arrival from UE spherical coverage directions, and one
from Rx Beam peak direction:

UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage
gain midpoint + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2 + UE gain G midpoint

UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB\_RP2
- Applied SSB\_RP1 - UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint

*where:*

Applied SSB\_RP1 and Applied SSB\_RP2 are specified in the test case,
either directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm per
subcarrier

UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint in dB is derived as (UE Refsens - UE
Spherical coverage)/2

*For the nominal values,* UE gain G midpoint cancels out for this
relative measurement, but UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint applies to
one Angle of Arrival. For the variations, UE gain variation cancels out
as the same value affects both cells, but Spherical coverage gain
variation applies to one Angle of Arrival.

Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ -
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~ ±UE
accuracy

*where:*

Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~ is derived from Refsens and
Spherical coverage, as in Figure A.2.1.2-1

UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred
to in A.2.6.1

### A.2.6.7 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis 

The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:

\- UE-measured SS-RSRP~nom~ is calculated using the relevant method in
A.2.6.2 to A.2.6.6

\- The range of SS-RSRP reported values is calculated using the relevant
methods in A.2.6.2 to A.2.6.6

A.2.7 Intra-frequency cells without AWGN, same Angle of Arrival
---------------------------------------------------------------

### A.2.7.1 Test system

In a practical test system running a test case where Intra-frequency
cells come from the same Angle of Arrival, the level uncertainties for
all cells will be highly correlated. If the test case has applied AWGN,
it will specify Noc and Es/Noc, and the absolute uncertainty for applied
AWGN will be the dominant contribution to the overall Es uncertainty for
each cell. As AWGN is common to all cells on that frequency, the
correlation is already included.

If the test case does not have applied AWGN, it will specify Es for each
cell, with an absolute Es uncertainty for each cell. The method of
handling the effect of correlation in the Test Tolerance analysis is
given in A.2.7.2 and A.2.7.3.

### A.2.7.2 Calculation method for Es/Iot at UE baseband

An example is provided here for a scenario with two intra-frequency
cells, without applied AWGN. SSB Es/Iot at UE baseband is calculated for
Cell 1. Interference to Cell 1 comes from the UE internal noise and from
Cell 2. The values are chosen for illustration, and not taken from any
specific test case.

Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~ ((Cell 1 SSB power) / (UE internal
noise + Cell 2 SSB power))

*Where* UE internal noise, Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear
powers in W, per subcarrier.

![](./media/image15.png){width="4.427083333333333in" height="1.5in"}

Figure A.2.7.2-1: Example Es/Iot~BB~ scenario, two intra-frequency cells

*In this case, the calculation gives* Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~
(0.139 / (0.037 + 0.070)) = **1.14dB**

The presence of UE internal noise also affects the calculation of Es/Iot
sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis. The UE internal
noise is a fixed (worst) value, being based on the UE minimum
requirement, and is taken into account in the scaling which uses linear
powers:

\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 1 Es = **+1.000**

\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 2 Es = -Cell 2 SSB power
/(UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power). In this example, (0.070 /
(0.037 + 0.070)) = -**0.651**

A positive sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for example increasing
Cell 1 Es. A negative sensitivity factor is used where an increase in
the quantity produces a decrease in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for example
increasing Cell 2 Es. The sensitivity factors are used to scale the
uncertainties.

Where the uncertainties are correlated, as here, they are added
arithmetically and the sign affects the result. In this example,
increasing Cell 1 Es increases the Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, but the
correlated increase in Cell 2 Es decreases the Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~.
The overall effect is smaller, and depends on the ratios of linear
powers.

### A.2.7.3 Calculation method for Applied Io

An example is provided here for a scenario with two intra-frequency
cells, without applied AWGN. Io applied to the UE is the arithmetic sum
of linear powers in the channel bandwidth. UE internal noise is not
counted, as it is not applied to the UE. The values are chosen for
illustration, and not taken from any specific test case.

Channel Io = 10Log~10~ (Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power) + 10Log~10~
(N~RB\_TC~ x 12)

*where:*

Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear powers in W, per subcarrier

N~RB\_TC~ is the number of PRBs allocated in the test case (not
necessarily equal to the number of PRBs in the channel bandwidth)

12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB

![](./media/image16.png){width="4.135416666666667in" height="1.21875in"}

Figure A.2.7.3-1: Example Io scenario, two intra-frequency cells

*With 24 PRBs allocated, the example gives* Io = 10Log~10~ ((0.139
+0.070) x10^-9^) +10Log~10~ (24 x 12) = **-72.2dBm**

Io sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis are based on
linear powers:

\- Io sensitivity to Cell 1 Es = Cell 1 power / (Cell 1 power + Cell 2
power). In this example, (0.139 / (0.139 + 0.070)) = **+0.667**

\- Io sensitivity to Cell 2 Es = Cell 2 power / (Cell 1 power + Cell 2
power). In this example, (0.070 / (0.139 + 0.070)) = +**0.333**

All the sensitivity factors are positive, as an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Io. The sensitivity factors are used to scale
the uncertainties.

Where the uncertainties are correlated, as here, they are added
arithmetically, and the sign affects the result. In this example
increasing Cell 1 Es increases Io, and the correlated increase in Cell 2
Es also increases Io. The overall effect of scaling adds up to 1, as
expected.

### A.2.7.4 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis

The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:

\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without
AWGN, Es/Iot~BB~ is calculated using the method in A.2.7.2.

\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without
AWGN, Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in
A.2.7.2.

\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without
AWGN, Io is calculated using the method in A.2.7.3.

\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without
AWGN, Io sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in A.2.7.3.

A.4 Design of radiated test cases defined in TS 38.533
======================================================

The design of radiated test cases defined in TS 38.533 is more
challenging than for conducted test cases, because the over-the-air path
loss reduces the downlink power seen by the UE, and reduces the uplink
power received by the test system.

The achievable downlink power in a practical test system is restricted,
and there is less dB range between the lowest and highest power that can
be applied within the UE Core requirement side conditions.

The range of uplink power that can be measured by a practical test
system is also restricted, by signal-to-noise ratio considerations at
the low end, and by the UE output power at the high end.

For both downlink and uplink, the achievable dB range is most restricted
when the signal arrives from the UE Spherical coverage direction. In a
test case it is further restricted by downlink power level uncertainty
or uplink power measurement uncertainty, which are both larger for
radiated signals than for conducted signals. This Annex considers the
effect of restricted dB range on radiated RRM test case design.

A.4.1 Downlink considerations
-----------------------------

### A.4.1.1 Side conditions for Rx Beam Peak angle of arrival

Side conditions for Rx Beam Peak angle of arrival are less stringent
than for Spherical Coverage angle of arrival. They are not directly
analysed here, but the same principles apply as for Spherical Coverage
in clause A.4.1.2.

### A.4.1.2 Side conditions for Spherical Coverage angle of arrival

As an example, consider a test case where the UE makes measurements on
the downlink signal, for example in Event-triggered reporting. Some side
condition values are band-dependent, and also depend on whether the cell
being measured is intra-frequency or inter-frequency. An adverse case is
chosen for illustration:

\- Spherical Coverage angle of arrival

\- Inter-frequency

\- UE Power Class 3

\- Band n259

\- Maximum multi-band relaxation

\- Full RB allocation

\- UE is required to make measurements, so side conditions apply

The scenario is however best case on two points:

\- Applied Es only, without Noc (only UE internal noise)

\- Only one cell on the frequency (no other intra-frequency cells)

![](./media/image17.png){width="3.8854166666666665in"
height="4.979166666666667in"}

Figure A.4.1.2-1: Example side conditions when UE is making measurements

It can be seen that when uncertainties are taken into account (an
indicative value of ±6dB is used), the applied level range can be from
-87dBm/SCS to -85dBm/SCS, a range of only 2dB. This is very restrictive
for the test case design.

### A.4.1.3 Test case design options to increase downlink dB range

A number of options are available to increase the dB range of the
applied downlink signal, if necessary. For a specific test case, only
some may be available, for example in a test case such as Radio Link
Monitoring, it would not be possible to use applied Es only, because the
test case relies on a well-defined SNR at the UE baseband.

########  Annex B: Acceptable uncertainty of test system for test cases defined in TS 38.521-2 for radiative testing

This annex contains suggested uncertainties for each test case in TS
38.521-2.

B.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
============================================

Three permitted test methodologies, DFF, IFF and NFTF, have been
identified for UE RF FR2 test cases defined in TS 38.521-2.

This Annex is deriving Total expanded Measurement Uncertainties per test
case for each test methodology.

Threshold MU is equivalent to Total expanded uncertainty of the
reference methodology which has been defined as IFF.

If the Total expanded Measurement Uncertainty per test case of a
permitted test method is lower than or equal to the threshold MU, then
that test method is applicable to the respective test cases defined in
TS 38.521-2.

B.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for DFF
------------------------------------------------------

The uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:

\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose
absolute gain is known at the frequencies of measurement

\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the
transmitter or receiver is performed.

The MU budget should comprise the following headings:

1\) The uncertainty source. Compile a complete list of the individual
measurement uncertainty elements that contribute to a measurement

2\) Determine the maximum value of each uncertainty

3\) Determine the distribution of each uncertainty (rectangular,
U-shaped, etc.),

4\) Calculate (if necessary) the standard deviation of each uncertainty,
*u~i~*, (NOTE 1) for each uncertainty element,

5\) Convert the units (if necessary) of each uncertainty element into
the chosen unit, i.e., dB,

6\) Combine ALL the standard uncertainties by the root-sum-squares
method to derive the \'combined standard uncertainty\',

7\) Multiply the resulting combined standard uncertainty by an expansion
factor \'*k*\' to derive the \'expanded uncertainty\' for a given
confidence level. All expanded uncertainties are quoted to 95%
confidence level, so *k* is taken as 1.96. This gives 95% confidence
that the true value is within 1.96 times the combined standard
uncertainty of the measured value to derive the \'expanded
uncertainty\'.

8\) Any systematic errors are added to the expanded uncertainty to
derive the 'total expanded uncertainty', i.e.,

NOTE 1: The standard deviation from a data set of *N* samples is defined
as

where *s~k~* are the respective sample results and the mean of all *N*
samples. For an uncertainty *u~i~* in dB, the dB values (instead of the
linear powers) of *s~k~* and are used.

B.1.2 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for IFF
------------------------------------------------------

The same as defined in B.1.1.

B.1.3 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for NFTF
-------------------------------------------------------

The same as defined in B.1.1 with the exception of Stage 2, only the
measurement of the DUT transmitter is performed.

B.2 Measurement error contribution descriptions
===============================================

B.2.1 Measurement error contribution descriptions for DFF
---------------------------------------------------------

### B.2.1.1 Positioning misalignment

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing
direction and the beam peak direction of the measurement antenna due to
imperfect rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in
both azimuth and vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment
depends highly on the beam width of the beam under test. The same level
of misalignment results in a larger measurement error for a narrower
beam.

### B.2.1.2 Measure distance uncertainty

The cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of
distance between the measurement antenna and the DUT. If the distance of
separation is 2D^2^/lambda based on D being the entire device size, then
the phase variation is 22.5deg. Whether this is the minimum acceptable
criteria of phase taper over the entire DUT is FFS and shall be assessed
during final MU definition for the test method. Any reduction in the
distance of separation increases the phase variation and creates an
error which is DUT dependant. Determination of limit of the error shall
be done during final MU definition for the test method.

### B.2.1.3 Quality of quiet zone

The quality of the quiet zone procedure characterizes the quiet zone
performance of the anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of
reflections within the anechoic chamber including any positioners and
support structures. The MU term additionally includes the amplitude
variations effect of offsetting the directive antenna array inside a DUT
from the centre of the quiet zone as well as the directivity MU, i.e.,
the variation of antenna gains in the different direct line-of-sight
links. An additional MU term related to phase variation and phase ripple
effects which depends on measurement distance is FFS, and shall be
assessed during final MU definition for the test method. This might
require an augmentation of the quality of the quiet zone validation
procedure.

### B.2.1.4 Mismatch

Mismatch uncertainty occurs when;

\- Changing the signal path between the measurement and calibration
procedure

\- Evaluating the insertion loss of a signal path

The mismatch uncertainty for a system consisting of a generator, a load
and a component in between is defined as

$\text{Mismatch\ contribution\ }\left( \text{standard\ deviation} \right) = \frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{generator}} \right| \cdot \left| \Gamma_{\text{load}} \right| \cdot \left| S_{21} \right| \cdot \left| S_{12} \right| \cdot 100}{\sqrt{2} \cdot 11.5}\ \text{dB}$,

Where $\Gamma$ denotes the reflection coefficient and $S_{21}$ is the
transmission coefficient, both in linear voltage ratios.

For a cascade of several components, the interactions between all
components have to be evaluated. For example, for four devices in a row
(shown in Figure B.2.1.4-1) the following contributions have to be
accounted for: AB, BC, CD, ABC, BCD, ABCD. The term ABCD represents the
interaction between A and D (generator and load) with the components B
and C in between.

Figure B.2.1.4-1: Cascade of components

The combined mismatch uncertainty is given by the root sum square of the
individual contributions:

$$combined\ mismatch\ uncertainty = \sqrt{\left( \text{AB} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{BC} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{CD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABC} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{BCD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABCD} \right)^{2}\ }$$

In an optimized test procedure, the overall mismatch uncertainty is
smaller when matching pairs of mismatches exist in the calibration and
measurement stage since these pairs cancel each other out. Figure
B.2.1.4-2 displays a calibration setup, where device D is replaced by
device F. The mismatch contributions for this path are AB, BC, CE, ABC,
BCE and ABCE. For a result based on the measurement and calibration
stage, the mismatch contributions AB, BC, and ABC are matching pairs as
they occur both in the measurement and calibration stage. Thus, they can
be eliminated \[11\], and the system mismatch uncertainty is obtained as
$\sqrt{\left( \text{CD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{CE} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{BCD} \right)^{2} + (BC{E)}^{2} + \left( \text{ABCD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABCE} \right)^{2}}$

Figure B.2.1.4-2: Sketch of a calibration path

In the following, an example mismatch uncertainty calculation for a
TX/RX patch from the measurement equipment to the measurement antenna is
performed for a frequency of 43.5GHz. The example path under
investigation consists of four SPDT switches, one SP6T switch and one
DPDT switch and microwave cable interconnects with PC2.4 mm connectors.
The attenuation and reflectance of typical components suitable for
frequencies ranging up to 43.5 GHz have been considered in the
calculation of the mismatch uncertainty.

Figure B1.1.4.4-3 shows a sample system setup for an EIRP/EIS test case
with rather simple complexity of the switch box similar to a current sub
6GHz test setup. It should be noted that the switch unit is
significantly less complex than a state-of-the-art switch unit currently
used for conformance tests.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The calculation of the overall mismatch uncertainty for a frequency of
43.5 GHz results in a value of 2.7 dB for the standard deviation, i.e.,
the expanded uncertainty is 5.3 dB.

Figure B.2.1.4-4 depicts a possible calibration for a part of the setup.

![](./media/image25.emf){width="6.0in" height="1.9270833333333333in"}

Figure B.2.1.4-4: Block Diagram of the calibration stage

For the VNA a return loss of 30 dB is assumed after a full two-port
calibration. The calculation of the system mismatch uncertainty applying
the elimination of matching pairs results in a value of 1.0 dB (standard
deviation) with an expanded value of 1.9 dB.

Since the overall mismatch uncertainty value is already a standard
deviation, which is RSS of values divided by the divisor (√2), the
overall mismatch uncertainty value should be divided by actual divisor 1
when calculating total mismatch.

### B.2.1.5 Standing Wave Between the DUT and measurement antenna

This uncertainty term is related to the amplitude ripple coming from the
standing waves between the DUT and measurement antenna. If this term is
not considered to be negligible one method to obtain this value is to
slide the DUT lambda/4 towards the measurement antenna while measuring
the amplitude. The uncertainty term can be derived by performing the
standard deviation on the results.

### B.2.1.6 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment

The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in the
EIRP tests as an absolute level. These receiving devices are spectrum
analysers, communication analysers, or power meters. The uncertainty
value will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. It needs to
be ensured that appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty contributions
are specified for the settings used such as bandwidth and absolute
level. If a power meter is used zero offset, zero drift and measurement
noise need to be included.

### B.2.1.7 Phase curvature

This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement
distance, which causes phase curvature across the antenna of
UE/reference antenna. At a measurement distance of 2D^2^/lambda the
phase curvature is 22.5 degrees. The impact of this factor shall be
assessed during final MU definition for the test method.

### B.2.1.8 Amplifier uncertainties

Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement
uncertainty. It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors
associated with the use of such components. For the case of external
amplifiers, the following uncertainties should be considered but the
applicability is contingent to the measurement implementation and
calibration procedure.

\- Stability

\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of
the amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both
measurement and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall
be considered. This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by
the manufacturers' data sheet for the operating conditions in which the
system will be required to operate.

\- Linearity

\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier
since in most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two
different input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either
measured or determined by the manufacturers' data sheet.

\- Noise Figure

\- When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the
SNR at the output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the
input. This added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the
Error Rate of the receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An
uncertainty can be calculated through the following formula:

![](./media/image26.emf){width="2.0in" height="0.3541666666666667in"}

\- Where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used
during the sensitivity measurement.

\- Mismatch

\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0dB. If it is not the case, the
mismatch uncertainty at its input and output shall be either measured or
determined by the method described in \[12\].

\- Gain

\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0dB. If it is not the case, this
uncertainty shall be considered.

### B.2.1.9 Random uncertainty

This contribution is used to account for all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with the measurements.

Random uncertainty MU contributions are normally distributed.

The random uncertainty term, by definition, cannot be measured, or even
isolated completely. However, past system definitions provide an
empirical basis for a value. Current LTE SISO OTA measurements have
random uncertainty contributions of \~0.2dB. A value of 0.5dB is
suggested due to increased sensitivity to random effects in more
complex, higher frequency NR test systems.

### B.2.1.10 Influence of the XPD

This factor takes into account the uncertainty caused due to the finite
cross polar discrimination (XPD) between the two polarization ports of
the measurement probe. The XPD of the probe antenna shall be take into
account during final MU definition for the test method.

A typical probe antenna can have XPD of 30dB.

A transmission matrix and calibration setup as shown in Figure
B.2.1.10-1 is considered here. Typically, a single-polarized reference
antenna with known gain is placed at the centre of the quiet zone and
the total attenuation, L, between the reference antenna terminal and the
feed antenna terminals is determined as part of the range reference
calibration procedure.

![](./media/image27.png){width="4.0in" height="1.3541666666666667in"}

Figure B.2.1.10-1: Calibration Setup

Since the reference antenna is considered a single-polarized antenna,
the XPD effect is negligible. Since the measurement probe is assumed to
be a dual-linearly polarized antenna, leakage from one
terminal/polarization to the other, i.e., XPD, needs to be considered.

The dual-linearly polarized measurement probe has two terminals
corresponding to a set of orthogonal polarizations, θ and φ which match
the orientations of the reference antenna. The most thorough calibration
procedure would determine the path losses between the four different
combinations of signal paths: θθ, θφ, φθ, and φφ, e.g., the power
received by the measurement probe at the θ polarization/terminal,
P~Feed,θ~, is attenuated by L~φθ~ with respect to the power delivered to
the reference antenna oriented in the φ polarization and placed in the
centre of quiet zone, P~QZ,φ~.

The most common calibration approach, however, is based on calibrating
the polarization matched paths in Figure B.2.1.10-1 (thick solid lines),
i.e., θθ and φφ. In this case, as illustrated in Figure B.2.1.10-2, the
normalized pathlosses L~θθ~ and L~φφ~ are 1 and the pathlosses of the
crossed components become the XPD terms of the measurement probe:

(1.1)

and

(1.2)

![](./media/image30.png){width="2.5in" height="1.28125in"}

Figure B.2.1.10-2: Common calibration approach based on calibrating the
polarization matched signal paths

In the remainder of this analysis, it is assumed that the leakage
between the two polarization ports of the measurement probe is assumed
to be the same, i.e., XPD = XPD~θφ~ = XPD~φθ~ and α = α~θφ~ = α~φθ~.

The normalized powers at the measurement probe terminals can then be
written as

(1.3)

(1.4)

The normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre
of the quiet zone is therefore

(1.5)

This simple analysis shows that the XPD of the measurement probe
introduces a small error of the total power measured by the measurement
probe and that the conservation of [measured]{.underline} powers is not
guaranteed, i.e., the MU based on the XPD can be expressed as

(1.6)

This XPD MU is tabulated for different levels of XPD in Table
B.2.1.10-1.

Table B.2.1.10-1: XPD MU for different XPD values

  XPD \[dB\]   MU~XPD~ \[dB\]
  ------------ ----------------
  -20          0.043
  -25          0.014
  -30          0.004
  -35          0.001
  -40          0.000

When the range reference calibration is based on a full matrix-based
approach, i.e., all signal paths are calibrated, the conservation of
measured powers is guaranteed. As shown in Figure B.2.1.10-3, the
polarization-matched signal paths take into account the leakage of power
into the cross paths.

![](./media/image35.png){width="2.5in" height="1.28125in"}

Figure B.2.1.10-3: Calibration approach based on calibrating all signal
paths

The powers at the measurement probe can now be written as

(1.7)

(1.8)

The normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre
of the quiet zone is then

(1.9)

This simple analysis now shows that for a matrix-based calibration of
all signal paths the XPD of the measurement probe no longer introduces
any error and that the conservation of [measured]{.underline} powers is
guaranteed, i.e., the MU based on the XPD is 0dB.

The derivation of the XPD MU based on powers is a more straightforward
and less complex approach than with electric fields as attempted in
\[2\]. This annex shows that the same XPU MU result as derived in (1.5)
can be derived using electric fields.

The corresponding signal paths are illustrated in Figure B.2.1.10-4.

![](./media/image39.png){width="2.5in" height="1.28125in"}

Figure B.2.1.10-4: Signal paths for electric fields (based on
calibrating the polarization matched signal paths)

The normalized fields at the measurement probe terminals can then be
written as

(1.10)

(1.11)

The transmission matrix can be defined as H

(1.12)

(1.13)

The total magnitude component of the electric field including
coherence/interference terms at the probe is

(1.14)

When it is assumed that leakage between the two polarization ports of
the measurement probe is assumed to be the same, then *a=c=*10^XPD/20^
in (1.14). Additionally, it has to be assumed that *d*=*b*+π which
guarantees the orthogonality between the two field vectors, i.e., the
dot product between the vectors has to be zero. With these assumptions,
Equation (1.14) will become

(1.15)

The normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre
of the quiet zone is therefore

(1.16)

The derived XPD MU based on electric fields which included the
coherence/interference terms in (1.16) is the same as in (1.6).

The XPD of the measurement system shall be determined from the quality
of quiet zone measurements, see clause O.2 of \[7\], at the 7 reference
points, P1 through P7, specifically with reference AUT orientations
γ=β=0^o^ for distributed axes systems, Section O.2.6.1 \[7\], or
reference AUT orientations β=α=0^o^ for combined-axes systems, Section
O.2.6.2 \[7\]. Alternatively, it can be determined using a reference
antenna optimized for XPD measurements and with the corresponding
alignment to achieve optimal polarization matching between the reference
and the measurement antenna.

The XPD for each reference point shall be calculated as the ratio of
cross-polarized to co-polarized measured powers and the largest XPD from
the 7 different reference points shall be used to determine the XPD MU,
i.e.,

(1-17)

where

(1-18)

### B.2.1.11 Insertion loss Variation

This uncertainty contribution comes from introducing an additional cable
which is not present for both the calibration and DUT measurement. If
the cables remain the same for the calibration and DUT measurement, then
the contribution should be set to zero.

If an additional cable is added for one part of the test, the insertion
loss must be accounted for in the measurement results. If the insertion
loss is measured the uncertainty contribution will be the combined
uncertainty related to the insertion loss measurement. The insertion
loss can also be taken from the datasheet and assumed to have a
rectangular distribution.

### B.2.1.12 RF leakage (from measurement antenna to receiver/transmitter)

This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s)
between measurement antenna and receiving/transmitting equipment. The
contribution also includes the noise leakage between the connector and
cable(s) between reference antenna and transmitting equipment for the
calibration phase. This uncertainty contributor is contained in the
contributor quality of quiet zone described in clause B.2.1.3 and its
value therefore is set to zero.

### B.2.1.13 Misalignment of positioning System

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle/tilt accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to
the beam peak this contribution can be considered negligible and
therefore set to zero.

### B.2.1.14 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer

This contribution originates from all uncertainties involved
transmission magnitude measurement with a network analyser, for example:
drift, frequency flatness, temperature variation from kit calibration to
path losses measurement as well as interpolation of calibration data if
test frequencies were not calibrated during path loss characterization.
The uncertainty value will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data
sheet. It needs to be ensured that appropriate manufacturer\'s
uncertainty contribution is specified for the absolute levels measured.

When an end-to-end system calibration approach is used, the absolute
levels are related to the total system losses of the measurement path.
When a split calibration approach is used, separate MU contributions
need to be determined

\- u\_cond: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the conducted portion
of the calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system
losses for the portion of the system calibrated

\- u\_rad: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the radiated portion
of the calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system
losses for the portion of the system calibrated

The total MU of the network analyser for the split calibration is the
RSS'ed value of u\_cond and u\_rad.

### B.2.1.15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna

The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the gain
uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty will come
from a calibration report with traceability to a National Metrology
Institute with measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the
guidelines outlined in internationally accepted standards.

### B.2.1.16 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna and the measurement antenna

This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and
pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the
reference antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each
other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

### B.2.1.17 gNB emulator uncertainty

gNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via multiple
external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and a circulator,
etc.) in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a relative
level. Receiving device used is typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA.
Generally there occurs uncertainty contribution from absolute level
accuracy, non-linearity and frequency characteristic of the gNB
emulator.

For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as calibration
equipment, gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration
measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on
the absolute level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be
assumed as systematic. This uncertainty should be calculated from the
manufacturer's data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless
otherwise informed. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is
included in the absolute level uncertainty.

### B.2.1.18 Phase centre offset of calibration

Gain is defined at the phase centre of the antenna. If the phase centre
of the calibration antenna is not aligned at the centre of the set up
during the calibration, then there will be uncertainty related to the
measurement distance.

The phase centre of a horn antenna moves with frequency along the taper
length of the antenna therefore during the calibration the phase centre
of all frequencies will not be aligned with the setup centre. The
associated uncertainty term can be estimated using the following formula
\[14\]:

![](./media/image49.emf){width="1.5625in" height="0.5729166666666666in"}

+/-20log((measurement distance -- d)/measurement distance) \[14\]

Where d~m~ is the measurement distance and d~p~ is the maximum
positional uncertainty. For a Horn antenna this is equal to 0.5 the
length of the taper. This uncertainty is considered to have a
rectangular distribution so the standard uncertainty is calculated by
dividing the uncertainty by √3.

The same equation applies to log periodic antennas with d~m~ being 0.5
the length of the boom.

For a dipole antenna, given that the phase centre of the antenna is
easily aligned with the centre of the set up the measurement uncertainty
is zero.

If the calibration antenna (i.e. horn) is adjusted during the
calibration to align the phase centre to the setup centre then this
uncertainty term can be considered to be zero.

As an example a horn with a taper length of 50 mm, at 43.5 GHz and a
measurement distance of 72.55 cm the uncertainty term is 0.62, with a
rectangular distribution the standard uncertainty is 0.358 dB.

For DFF systems this uncertainty contribution must be included.

### B.2.1.19 Quality of quiet zone for calibration process

During the calibration process the calibration antenna will be placed at
the centre of the quiet zone. Therefore, only point P1 from the
procedure outlined in B.2.1.3 needs to be considered for the quality of
the quiet zone validation measurement.

For gain calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the EIRP results
obtained following the method outlined in clause O.2.8 of \[7\] shall be
used.

### B.2.1.20 Standing wave between reference calibration antenna and measurement antenna

This term comes from the amplitude ripple caused by the standing waves
between the reference antenna and measurement antenna. This value can be
captured by sliding (lambda/4) the reference antenna towards the
measurement antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing
a ripple in amplitude. The uncertainty term can be derived by performing
the standard deviation on the results.

### B.2.1.21 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (Flexing cables, adapters, attenuators, connector repeatability)

During the calibration measurement a cable (adapters, attenuators) is
used to feed the calibration antenna. This uncertainty captures any
influence the cable may have on the measurements result. This term can
be assessed by repeating measurements while flexing the cables and
rotary joints and using the largest difference between the results as
the uncertainty. For some calibration test configurations this
uncertainty can be considered to be zero.

### B.2.1.22 Influence of TRP measurement grid

This contributor describes the uncertainty of the measured TRP value due
to the finite number of measurement grid points.

### B.2.1.23 Influence of beam peak search grid

This contributor describes the uncertainty of absolute TX power beam
peak measurements, e.g., EIRP in beam peak direction, due to the finite
number of measurement points in the beam peak search grid.

### B.2.1.24 Systematic error due to TRP calculation/quadrature

When calculating TRP using different quadrature of constant step size
data, a mean error shall be taken into account. The value of this
contributor depends on the number of measurement grid points and the
quadrature technique used.

No mean error has to be taken into account for constant density approach
(using the charged particle or the golden spiral implementation) for
non-sparse antenna arrays.

This measurement uncertainty contributor represents a systematic
uncertainty and must not be root sum squared with contributors described
by standard deviation.

### B.2.1.25 Multiple measurement antenna uncertainty

This contributor describes the uncertainty caused by switching multiple
measurement antennas either by mechanically or electrically to measure
TRx spurious emission.

A frequency range of spurious tests (e.g. general spurious emission) is
defined from 6 GHz to second harmonic of FR2 bands such as 80 GHz. Since
that frequency range is quite wide, it is impossible to cover the whole
range only by one measurement antenna. Therefore to provide a feature of
the spurious emission measurement by FR2 test system, the system has to
equip a capability to switch corresponding measurement antennas in an
anechoic chamber. One of the mechanical antenna switching methods can be
a structure of a slider. Then a repeatability of a bending loss of a
feeder cable which is connected to the measurement antennas shall be
taken into account. On the other hand for electrical antenna switching,
since multiple antennas need to be aligned in a chamber with a different
position, the quiet zone characteristics might receive an influence by a
displacement from the ideal focal point. In a case of electrical
switching system, if the measurement antenna configuration is the same
for the quality of the quiet zone measurement and the DUT measurement,
then this uncertainty term is encompassed in the quality of the quiet
zone results.

### B.2.1.26 DUT repositioning

This contributor describes the uncertainty due to a displacement of a
DUT. The DUT may need to be re-positioned between measurements, for
instance when the battery runs low in charge.

### B.2.1.27 Influence of noise

This contributor describes an offset uncertainty factor caused by a
noise floor especially in a case of low SNR. This contributor works as a
bias to measured results only to a direction to increase values and thus
this shall be included in the uncertainty budget table as a systematic
uncertainty. The uncertainty value can be derived by the following
equation.

### B.2.1.28 Systematic error related to beam peak search

When calculating beam peak search a systematic error shall be taken into
account. The value of this contributor depends on the number of
measurement grid points.

This measurement uncertainty contributor represents a systematic
uncertainty and must not be root sum squared with contributors described
by standard deviation.

### B.2.1.29 Influence of spherical coverage grid

This contributor describes the uncertainty of spherical measurements,
due to the finite number of measurement points in the spherical coverage
grid.

### B.2.1.30 Systematic error related to EIS spherical coverage

When calculating EIS spherical coverage, a mean error shall be taken
into account. The value of this contributor depends on the DL power step
size used for the EIS search and then number of measurement grid points.

This measurement uncertainty contributor represents a systematic
uncertainty and must not be root sum squared with contributors described
by standard deviation.

### B.2.1.31 Misalignment of DUT due to change of DUT orientation

This contributor describes the uncertainty due to a mis-alignment of a
DUT after a change of DUT orientations described in Tables J.2-1 through
J.2-3 in \[3\] during spurious emission and spherical coverage
measurements. This contribution is negligible with spherical coverage TC
as far as the misalignment is within the accuracy of DUT re-positioning.

### B.2.1.32 Additional Impact of Interferer ACLR

This contribution describes the effect of the interferer ACLR over the
wanted signal channel when testing ACS and in-band blocking. Even if
power is set perfectly in the configured transmission bandwidth,
interferer power will leak in the wanted signal channel due to its ACLR.

### B.2.1.33 Modulated Interferer uncertainty

Modulated Interferer is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via
multiple external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and a
circulator, etc.) in ACS and In-band Blocking tests either as an
absolute level or as a relative level. Receiving device used is
typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA. Generally, there occurs uncertainty
contribution from absolute level accuracy, non-linearity and frequency
characteristic of the interferer generator.

For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as calibration
equipment, Modulated Interferer is connected to the system after the
calibration measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the
uncertainty on the absolute level of Modulated Interferer (transmitter
device) cannot be assumed as systematic. This uncertainty should be
calculated from the manufacturer's data in logs with a rectangular
distribution, unless otherwise informed. Furthermore, the uncertainty of
the non-linearity is included in the absolute level uncertainty.

### B.2.1.35 Influence of offset antenna for blocker signal

This MU term describes the additional uncertainty caused by using offset
antenna for blocker signal for FR2 blocking test cases. The cause of
additional MU using offset antenna is the difference of UE antenna's
gain between beam peak direction and offset beam peak direction, which
will cause the error for the ACS or IBB performance requirement which is
given by the power ratio of the wanted signal power and blocker signal
power. Such difference of the UE antenna gain can be compensated by
increasing the blocker signal power by the measured EIS difference at
beam peak direction and at offset beam peak. Despite this compensation,
there still is a residual error corresponding to the antenna gain
difference due to different frequency of wanted and blocker signal.
Table B.2.1.35-1 summarizes the residual error after compensation for
various offset angle assumption.

### B.2.1.36 Uncertainty of the RF relative power measurement equipment

The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in the
EIRP tests as a relative level. These receiving devices are spectrum
analysers, communication analysers, or power meters. The uncertainty
value will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. Basically,
the linearity and impact of the averaging time needs to be considered in
this MU term.

B.2.3 Measurement error contribution descriptions for NFTF
----------------------------------------------------------

### B.2.3.1 Axes Alignment

Includes the following mechanical alignment errors:

> \- The uncertainty related with the lateral displacement between the
> horizontal and vertical axes of the DUT positioner.
>
> \- The differences from 90° of the angle between the horizontal and
> vertical axes.
>
> \- The horizontal mis-pointing of the horizontal axis to the probe
> reference point for Theta=0°.

These mechanical errors can result in sampling the field on a non-ideal
sphere. This uncertainty can be considered to have a normal
distribution.

### B.2.3.2 Measurement Distance uncertainty

See B.2.1.2.

### B.2.3.3 Quality of the Quiet Zone

See B.2.1.3.

### B.2.3.4 Mismatch

See B.2.1.4.

### B.2.3.5 Multiple Reflections: Coupling Measurement Antenna and DUT

The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal
is reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna
and re-reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving
antenna. This uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of
the DUT when at different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a U-shaped distribution.

### B.2.3.6 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment

See B.2.1.6.

### B.2.3.7 Phase curvature

See B.2.1.7.

### B.2.3.8 Amplifier uncertainties

See B.2.1.8.

### B.2.3.9 Random uncertainty

See B.2.1.9.

### B.2.3.10 Influence of the XPD

Refer to B.2.1.10. If the Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase is
measured and corrected for then this uncertainty term can be considered
to be zero.

### B.2.3.11 NF to FF truncation

The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical
modes. The number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering
effect generated by the finite number of modes can improve measurement
results by removing signals from outside the physical area of the DUT.
Care must be taken in order to make sure the removed signals are not
from the DUT itself. This term also includes the uncertainty related to
the scan area truncation. This uncertainty is usually negligible. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.

### B.2.3.12 Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase

The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.

### B.2.3.13 Probe Array Uniformity (for multi-probe systems only)

This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used
for each physical position. Different probes have different radiation
patterns. Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the
uniformity of the probes is achieved. This uncertainty term must be
considered if the amplitude and phase of each probe is not identical or
corrected for. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution

### B.2.3.14 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer

See B.2.1.14.

### B.2.3.15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna

See B.2.1.15.

### B.2.3.16 Phase Recovery Non-Linearity over signal bandwidth

This uncertainty originates from the non-linearity of the phase recovery
for wide band signal. The phase recovery can be due to either phase
non-linearity of the receiver and/or the DUT itself. The method to
quantify the non-linarites is not defined.

### B.2.3.17 Probe Pattern Effect

The probe/s pattern/s is assumed to be known so that the DUT measurement
in near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far
field transform. If the probe pattern is known, then the uncertainty
term is zero. There is no direct dependence between the DUT pattern and
the probe pattern in near field measurements. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution.

### B.2.3.18 Phase centre offset of calibration

See B.2.1.18.

### B.2.3.19 Quality of the Quiet Zone for Calibration Process

See B.2.1.19.

### B.2.3.20 Phase Drift and Noise

This uncertainty is due to the noise level and drift of the test range
and should be determined or measured at the DUT location. The noise
level is usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution.

### B.2.3.21 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna

See B.2.1.4.

### B.2.3.22 Influence of TRP measurement grid

See B.2.1.22.

### B.2.3.23 

### B.2.3.24 

### B.2.3.25 Leakage and Crosstalk

This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system
setup. The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random
amplitude and phase errors so that the relative importance should be
determined. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.

### B.2.3.26 Systematic error due to TRP calculation/quadrature

See B.2.1.24.

### B.2.3.27 Multiple measurement antenna uncertainty

See B.2.1.25.

### B.2.3.28 DUT repositioning

See B.2.1.26.

### B.2.3.29 Influence of noise

See B.2.1.27.

### B.2.3.30 Uncertainty of the RF relative power measurement equipment

See B.2.1.36.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of D = \[5
cm\], f = {22.65GHz, 31.1GHz, 45.1GHz}, P = \[maximum output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP and TRP is provided in Table
B.3.1-2.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of D = \[5
cm\], f = {22.65GHz, 31.1GHz, 45.1GHz}, P = \[maximum output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.6.1-2.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ \[30 cm\], f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz}, \[P = maximum
output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.6.2-2 for
PC3 UEs and in Table B.6.2-6 for PC1 UEs.

The uncertainty assessment table is organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of D = \[5
cm\], f = {22.65GHz, 31.1GHz, 45.1GHz}, P = \[maximum output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.6.1-2.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of D = \[5
cm\], f = {23.45 GHz, 32.125 GHz, 40.8 GHz, 44.3 GHz}, P = \[Minimum
output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.7.1-2.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ 30 cm, f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz, 44.3GHz}, P =
Minimum output power.

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.7.2-2 for
PC3 UEs and in Table B.7.2-3 for PC1 UEs.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ 30 cm, f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz, 44.3 GHz}, P = Off
power.

\- The uncertainty assessment for TRP is provided in Table B.8.2-2 for
PC3 UEs and Table B.8.2-6 for PC1 and PC5 UEs.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of D = \[5
cm\], f = {22.65GHz, 31.1GHz, 45.1GHz}, P = \[maximum output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP relative power control tolerance
is provided in Table B.9a.2.1-2.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ \[30 cm\], f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz}.

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP relative power control tolerance
is provided in Table B.9a.2.2-2.for PC3 UEs and in Table B.9a.2.2-3 for
PC1 UEs.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ 30 cm, f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz}, for PC3 with
measured UE power in the range 0dBm + MU to 0dBm + MU + uplink power
control window size, where

> \- MU is the test system uplink absolute power measurement uncertainty
> for minimum output power in Table B.7.2-2.
>
> \- Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) + 5 dB
> (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system uplink relative power
> measurement uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is
> specified in TS 38.101-1 \[2\], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 5dB for 1dB
> power step size, and the Test system uplink relative power measurement
> uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 in TS 38.521-2 for TC
> 6.4.2.2 with a value of 1.4 dB.

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.17.2-2 for
PC3 UEs and Table B.17.2-3 for PC1 UEs.

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
zone size ≤ \[30 cm\], f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz}, P = \[Maximum
output power\].

\- Values above are calculated considering a TE noise floor assumption
of -10.6 dBm/400 MHz for FR2a and -8.5 dBm/400 MHz for FR2b and
additional TE measurement uncertainty (not related to TE noise floor) as
shown in Table B.12-2-3 and Table B.12-2-4 added quadratically.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of D = \[5
cm\], f = {23.45 GHz, 32.125 GHz, 40.8 GHz}, P = \[Maximum output
power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for TRP is provided in Table B.16.1-2.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ \[30 cm\], f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz, 44.3GHz}, P =
\[Maximum output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for TRP is provided in Table B.16.2-2 for
PC3 UEs and in Table B.16.2-4 for PC1 and PC5 UEs.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ 30 cm, f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz, 44.3GHz}, P =
Maximum output power - MPR -- MBR(Multi-band relaxation).

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.17.2-2 for
PC3 UEs and Table B.17.2-3 for PC1 UEs.

B.18 Spurious emissions
=======================

Editor's Note:

\- MU value analysis and offset value analysis for PC 2 and 4 are not
complete.

\- MU offset value analysis for PC2 and 4 are not complete.

\- MU value analysis for various test setups in clause B.18.x is not
complete for above 87 GHz.

Test procedure of general spurious emission comprises 2 stages: coarse
TRP measurement and fine TRP measurement BW. Coarse TRP measurement is
introduced to reduce the measurement time by applying sparser grids
and/or wider measurement BW than fine TRP measurement while having
offset dB more stringent test requirement in order not to cause
additional misjudgement risk. For the frequency ranges for which coarse
TRP measurement does not PASS, the measurement is continued with fine
TRP measurement procedure.

Tables B.18-1, B.18-1a, B.18-1b summarizes the MU threshold for fine TRP
measurements for General spurious emissions, spurious emission band UE
co-existence and additional spurious emission, respectively. The origin
MU values for fine TRP measurement for different test setups can be
found in following subclauses.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ \[30 cm\], f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz}.

\- The uncertainty assessment for Beam Correspondence - EIRP is provided
in Table B.18a.2-2.for PC3.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ \[30 cm\], f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz, 44.3GHz}, \[P
= maximum output power\].

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIS is provided in Table B.19.2-2 for
PC3 and PC6 UEs and Table B.19.2-3 for PC1 UEs.

Test procedure of general spurious emission comprises 2 stages: coarse
TRP measurement and fine TRP measurement BW. Coarse TRP measurement is
introduced to reduce the measurement time by applying sparser grids
and/or wider measurement BW than fine TRP measurement while having
offset dB more stringent test requirement in order not to cause
additional misjudgement risk. For the frequency ranges for which coarse
TRP measurement does not PASS, the measurement is continued with fine
TRP measurement procedure.

Table B.25-1 summarizes the MU threshold for fine TRP measurements for
General spurious emissions. The origin MU values for fine TRP
measurement for different test setups can be found in following
subclauses.

measurement uncertainty including the effect from uncertainty due to
Coarse TRP measurement grid, excluding influence of noise.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ 30 cm, f = {6 GHz to 87 GHz}, P =Receiver Spurious Core
Requirement Level + Relaxation(For n257, 10.2dB for 6GHz ≤ f \< 20GHz,
17.2 dB for 20GHz≤ f \< 40GHz, 33.1dB for 40GHz ≤ f ≤ 2^nd^ harmonic)

\- The uncertainty assessment for TRP is provided from Table B.25.2-2 to
Table B.25.2-11 for PC3 UEs and from Table B.25.2-12 to Table B.25.2-16
for PC1, PC5 and PC6 UEs.

consolidated baseline tables for demodulation test cases and can be
removed once the MU tables customized for each TS 38.521-4 test case
have been finalized.

This annex contains suggested uncertainties for each test case in TS
38.521-4.

The baseline MU table for Mode 1 (conditions with external noise) is
shown in Table D-1 for baseband-combining implementation and in Table
D-2 for external-combining implementation.

 D.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
============================================

D.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for DNF
------------------------------------------------------

The uncertainty tables cover the actual measurement using the DUT
receiver. If applicable, any uncertainty arising from a calibration or
alignment process before the measurements should also be included.

The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and
divisor).

D.1.2 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for DFF
------------------------------------------------------

The same as defined in D.1.1.

D.1.3 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for IFF
------------------------------------------------------

The same as defined in D.1.1.

D.2 Measurement error contribution descriptions
===============================================

D.2.1 Measurement error contribution descriptions for DNF
---------------------------------------------------------

### D.2.1.1 gNB emulator SNR uncertainty

This contribution originates from setting the ratio of signal and noise
in the conducted part of the test system. It is estimated to be the same
as for LTE conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which is ±0.3dB.
The default for values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence interval,
normal distribution.

### D.2.1.2 gNB emulator Downlink EVM

When simulations of demodulation performance are run, the downlink
signal is modelled with a defined EVM, representing imperfections in the
signal transmitted by the gNB. This EVM value is agreed across companies
to align simulations, and is normally lower than the gNB EVM
requirement, to represent "typical" conditions. The EVM used for
simulations is therefore built in to the requirement points, normally
specified as the SNR required to meet a specified throughput, with a
defined modulation and Reference channel, under defined propagation
conditions.

For a conformance test, the EVM defined for the simulations is taken as
a maximum allowed value for the test system, as a worse gNB emulator EVM
would make the signal harder to demodulate, and disadvantage the UE. In
a test system the EVM cannot normally be set to a specific value, but is
specified to be no higher than a defined value.

Following this approach, the uncertainty from gNB emulator Downlink EVM
is a one-sided distribution, with beneficial effect. Without treating
the positive and negative uncertainties separately, and as it would not
make the SNR worse, the effective uncertainty is 0dB.

### D.2.1.3 gNB emulator fading model impairments

This contribution originates from imperfections in the gNB emulator
fading model, compared to the applied fading model. It is estimated to
be the same as for LTE conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which
is ±0.5dB. The default for values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence
interval, normal distribution.

D.2.2 Measurement error contribution descriptions for DFF
---------------------------------------------------------

### D.2.2.1 gNB emulator SNR uncertainty

See D.2.1.1.

### D.2.2.2 gNB emulator Downlink EVM

See D.2.1.2.

### D.2.2.3 gNB emulator fading model impairments

See D.2.1.3.

D.2.3 Measurement error contribution descriptions for IFF
---------------------------------------------------------

The Measurement uncertainty contributions and uncertainty assessment are
expected to be the same as for the Direct near field (DNF) setup in
D.2.1.

### D.2.3.1 gNB emulator SNR uncertainty

See D.2.1.1.

### D.2.3.2 gNB emulator Downlink EVM

See D.2.1.2.

### D.2.3.3 gNB emulator fading model impairments

See D.2.1.3.

D.3 Assessment of testable DL SNR range and accuracy
----------------------------------------------------

The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated
by the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise
provided by the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and
potentially limiting the testable SNR range. The calculations and graphs
in this clause allow this SNR degradation to be assessed over a range of
scenarios.

For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set
much higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible.
However for over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically
be delivered into the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test
point is likely to be closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation
is allowable.

### D.3.1 Method and Parameters

The method is the same as in clause B.2.1.5.1 of TR 38.810 \[13\], but
some values related to the test system are different. The calculation of
noise level is described in clause 7.2.1.3 of TR 38.810 \[13\]. Under
fading conditions the backoff is \[17.71\] dB instead of 13 dB when no
fading applies.

Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine
how high the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the
maximum SNR is set by the test system power amplifier and the channel
bandwidth to be tested.

The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Indirect
Far field (IFF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and
is based on the "IFF 100MHz ( n257, n258, n261)" tab of the accompanying
spreadsheet.

The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in
the diagram.

Figure D.3.2.2-1: Estimation of single band UE SNR range for Indirect
far field (IFF) when no fading applies

The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.

For mode2 (noise free) scenarios, the expected SNR at the UE reference
point is determined by the level of wanted signal power set by the TE
above the UE REFSENS point.

The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
±5.19 dB.

Inclusion of this contribution directly reduces the maximum SNR that can
be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth.

To find the maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a
specific Channel BW, the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased
until the value "Wanted signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW" is just below the
"Available DL power at CW 1dB compression at QZ, dBm" value. For fading
conditions, the "Backoff from P1dB" with a value of -11.08 dB valid for
modulations up to 64 QAM has been applied. In the case without fading
with added noise, the "Backoff from P1dB" is \[-13\] dB valid for
modulations up to 64 QAM. The resulting values for SNR~BB~ are given in
Table D.3.2.2-1 for tests cases making use of fading, D.3.2.2-2 for test
cases without fading with added Noise.

Single band UE values are obtained by setting the UE multi-band
relaxation factor to 0 dB.

D.4 Simulation results
----------------------

During the MU discussions to determine the maximum testable SNR for IFF
setup with PC3 30cm QZ, it was found that using a conservative "backoff
from P1 dB" value (where signal backoff and fading crest factor were
considerably independently), caused most of the RAN4 defined test points
to be untestable.

By simulating the CCDF of RAN4 defined signal waveform and faded signal
waveform, it was concluded to consider the faded signal crest factor
instead of independently adding signal crest factor and fading crest
factor.

Figure D.4-1 below captures the CCDF of test 2-6 from table
7.2.2.2.1\_1.4-2 of TS 38.521-4 which was considered as the scenario
with highest faded signal crest factor for 64QAM.

For the simulation, actual signal corresponding to the RAN4 defined
scenarios was generated and the appropriate fading profile as specified
in the requirement was applied. Simulations were run for 4\*10\^8
samples.

In figure D.4-1, Hx denotes the actual RAN4 signal per Rx after fading
is applied. The value in dB against each legend correspond to the
computed PAPR for that signal and faded signal

Considering the max PAPR value of the faded signal allowed some more
test points to be testable. In order to make more test points testable,
higher probability of saturation of faded signal needed to be
considered.

In order to determine how much faded signal clipping probability did not
adversely impact the UE's capability to successfully decode the PDSCH
signal, simulations were run for most of the 64QAM and 256QAM test
points defined in TS 38.521-4.

Two companies participated in providing the simulation results. Below
tables and figures capture the simulation results from the 2 companies
that was used to determine the faded signal clipping probability to be
used for the "backoff from P1 dB" term.

For 64QAM scenarios (both Demod and CSI), fading backoff margin of 11.08
dB corresponding to the 1e-3 faded signal clipping probability was
considered.

For 256QAM Demod, fading backoff margin of 12.62 dB corresponding to
1e-3 fading signal clipping probability was considered.

For 256QAM CSI scenarios, fading backoff margin of 15.36 dB
corresponding to 1e-4 fading signal clipping probability was considered.

######## Annex E: Acceptable uncertainty of test system for test cases defined in TS 38.533 for radiative testing

This annex contains suggested uncertainties for each test case or MU
quantity in TS 38.533 \[10\].

E.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
============================================

E.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for DFF
------------------------------------------------------

The uncertainty tables cover the actual measurement using the DUT. In
some cases, uncertainty may also arise from a calibration or alignment
process before the measurements.

When a calibration process is used before the measurements, the
uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:

\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose
absolute gain is known at the frequencies of measurement

\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the
transmitter or receiver is performed.

The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and
divisor).

### E.3.1.5 Uncertainty budget format and assessment for IFF+DFF Hybrid test setup

For DFF probe, Uncertainty shall be evaluated using the Uncertainty
budget format as specified in E.3.1.1.

For IFF probe, Uncertainty shall be evaluated using the Uncertainty
budget format as specified in E.3.1.3.

The overall uncertainty of the IFF+DFF Hybrid test set up shall be
calculated with the max(Total DFF probe MU, Total IFF probe MU).

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ 30 cm, f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz}.

\- The uncertainty assessment is applicable for 1AoA test cases

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP is provided in Table B.3.5.3-2
for PC3 UEs

### E.3.5.4 Uncertainty budget format and assessment for Enhanced IFF test setup

Editor's Note : Applicability of MU in this section for 2AoA Test Cases
needs to be reassessed once 2AoA Test Cases requiring UL power
measurement is defined.

The uncertainty contributions that may impact the overall MU value are
listed in Table E.3.5.4-1.

Table E.3.5.4-1: Uncertainty contributions for EIRP UL absolute power
measurement

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D

\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet
Zone size ≤ 30 cm, f = {23.45GHz, 32.125GHz, 40.8GHz}.

\- The uncertainty assessment is applicable for 1AoA and 2AoA test cases

\- The uncertainty assessment is provided in Table E.3.5.4-2.

### E.3.5.5 Uncertainty budget format and assessment for IFF+DFF Hybrid test setup

For DFF probe, Uncertainty shall be evaluated using the Uncertainty
budget format as specified in E.3.5.1.

For IFF probe, Uncertainty shall be evaluated using the Uncertainty
budget format as specified in E.3.5.3.

The overall uncertainty of the IFF+DFF Hybrid test set up shall be
calculated with the max(Total DFF probe MU, Total IFF probe MU).

######## Annex F: Applicable MTSU for Different QZ/Device Sizes

The applicability mapping between minimum QZ size, maximum device size
and MTSU is outlined in Table F-1. The underlying assumptions for the
mapping are as follows:

> \- The maximum device size ranges/limits follow the currently defined
> quiet zone sizes, i.e., 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, and 55cm \[7\], \[18\]
>
> \- The applicable MTSU follows the max device size, e.g., a max device
> size of 30cm to 40cm yields an MTSU of MTSU~40cm~
>
> \- The applicable MTSU is the same regardless of whether a grey-box or
> black-box approach \[7\], \[18\] is selected to simplify the mapping
> and to prevent different test requirements for the same device
> depending on whether black or grey box is applied
>
> \- A maximum device size exceeding 55cm but with antenna separations
> of ≤55cm does not have an applicable MTSU given the lack of a larger
> QZ
>
> \- Devices with \>55cm maximum device size do not have an applicable
> MTSU given the lack of a larger QZ
