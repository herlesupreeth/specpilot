4 General
=========

4.1 Relationship with other core specifications
-----------------------------------------------

The present document is a single-RAT specification for a SAN, covering
RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conducted and
radiated core requirements are defined for the SAN architectures and SAN
types defined in clause 4.3.

The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 4.6.

4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS
38.181 \[3\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.181 \[3\]
define test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the
minimum requirements in this specification to create test requirements.
For some requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test
tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
\[4\].

4.3 Requirement reference points
--------------------------------

### 4.3.1 SAN type 1-H

For *SAN type 1-H*, the requirements are defined for two points of
reference, signified by radiated requirements and conducted
requirements.

![C:\\Users\\sunsang\\Pictures\\Saved Pictures\\san
diagram.png](./media/image4.png){width="6.420833333333333in"
height="3.38125in"}

Figure 4.3.1-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *SAN type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
radiated interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary*
(RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements.
The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality receiving and transmitting modulated signal to ensure
radio links with users.

The satellite payload is composed by a transceiver unit array and a
composite antenna array. The transceiver unit array contains an
implementation specific number of transmitter units and an
implementation specific number of receiver units.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

### 4.3.2 SAN type 1-O and SAN type 2-O

For *SAN type 1-O and SAN type 2-O*, the radiated characteristics are
defined over the air (OTA), where the *operating band* specific radiated
interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB).
Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The
(spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

4.4 Satellite Access Node classes
---------------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Satellite Access Node
unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios are exactly
the same for SAN with and without connectors.

For SAN *type 1-O*, *SAN type 1-H* and SAN *type 2-O*, two SAN classes
(LEO and GEO) are defined in Table 4.4-1.

4.5 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

5.3 Satellite Access Node channel bandwidth
-------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

The *SAN channel bandwidth* supports a single RF carrier in the uplink
or downlink at the SAN. Different *UE channel bandwidths* may be
supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving
from UEs connected to the SAN. The placement of the *UE channel
bandwidth* is flexible but can only be completely within the *SAN
channel bandwidth*. The SAN shall be able to transmit to and/or receive
from one or more UE bandwidth parts that are smaller than or equal to
the number of carrier resource blocks on the RF carrier, in any part of
the carrier resource blocks.

The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guard band and the
*transmission bandwidth configuration* is shown in figure 5.3.1-1.

.

Figure 5.3.1-1: Definition of channel bandwidth and *transmission
bandwidth configuration* for one channel

### 5.3.2 Transmission bandwidth configuration

The *transmission bandwidth configuration* N~RB~ for each *SAN channel
bandwidth* and subcarrier spacing is specified in table 5.3.2.-1 for
FR1-NTN and table 5.3.2-2 for FR2-NTN.

NOTE: All Tx and Rx requirements are defined based on *transmission
bandwidth configuration* specified in table 5.3.2-1 for FR1-NTN and
table 5.3.2-2 for FR2-NTN.

The transmission bandwidth configuration for NB-IoT is specified in TS
36.108 \[17\] clause 5.3B.

### 5.3.3 Minimum guardband and transmission bandwidth configuration

The minimum guard band for each *SAN channel bandwidth* and SCS is
specified in table 5.3.3-1 for FR1-NTN and in table 5.3.3-2 for FR2-NTN.

height="2.124676290463692in"}

Figure 5.3.3-1: SAN PRB utilization

In the case that multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same
symbol, the minimum guard band on each side of the carrier is the guard
band applied at the configured *SAN channel bandwidth* for the
numerology that is transmitted/received immediately adjacent to the
guard band.

Figure 5.3.3-2: Guard band definition when transmitting multiple
numerologies

NOTE: Figure 5.3.3-2 is not intended to imply the size of any guard
between the two numerologies. Inter-numerology guard band within the
carrier is implementation dependent.

### 5.3.4 RB alignment

For each *SAN channel bandwidth* and each numerology, *SAN transmission
bandwidth configuration* must fulfil the minimum guard band requirement
specified in clause 5.3.3.

For each numerology, its common resource blocks are specified in clause
4.4.4.3 in TS 38.211 \[5\], and the starting point of its *transmission
bandwidth configuration* on the common resource block grid for a given
channel bandwidth is indicated by an offset to "Reference point A" in
the unit of the numerology.

For each numerology, all *UE transmission bandwidth configurations*
indicated to UEs served by the SAN by higher layer parameter
*carrierBandwidth* defined in TS 38.331 \[6\] shall fall within the *SAN
transmission bandwidth configuration*.

### 5.3.5 SAN channel bandwidth per operating band

The requirements in this specification apply to the combination of *SAN
channel bandwidths*, SCS and *operating bands* shown in table 5.3.5-1
for FR1-NTN and table 5.3.5-2 for FR2-NTN. The *transmission bandwidth
configuration* in table 5.3.2-1 and table 5.3.2-2 shall be supported for
each of the *SAN channel bandwidths* within the SAN capability. The *SAN
channel bandwidths* are specified for both the Tx and Rx path.

5.4 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 5.4.1 Channel spacing

#### 5.4.1.1 Channel spacing for adjacent carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the *SAN channel bandwidths*.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent SAN carriers is defined
as following:

\- For SAN FR1-NTN *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster,

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

\- For SAN FR2-NTN *operating bands* with 60 kHz channel raster,

\- Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-20
kHz, 0 kHz, 20 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 60 kHz

\- Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-40
kHz, 0 kHz, 40 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 120 kHz

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *SAN channel bandwidths*
of the two respective SAN carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.

### 5.4.2 Channel raster

#### 5.4.2.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster

The global frequency raster defines a set of *RF reference frequencies*
F~REF~. The *RF reference frequency* is used in signalling to identify
the position of RF channels, SS blocks and other elements. The global
frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz. The
granularity of the global frequency raster is ΔF~Global~.

*RF reference frequencies* are designated by an NR Absolute Radio
Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) in the range \[0...3279165\] on the
global frequency raster. The relation between the NR-ARFCN and the *RF
reference frequency* F~REF~ in MHz is given by the following equation,
where F~REF-Offs~ and N~Ref-Offs~ are given in table 5.4.2.1-1 and
N~REF~ is the NR-ARFCN.

F~REF~ = F~REF-Offs~ + ΔF~Global~ (N~REF~ -- N~REF-Offs~)

The *channel raster* defines a subset of *RF reference frequencies* that
can be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and
downlink. The *RF reference frequency* for an RF channel maps to a
resource element on the carrier. For each *operating band*, a subset of
frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that
band and forms a channel raster with a granularity ΔF~Raster~, which may
be equal to or larger than ΔF~Global~.

For the uplink of FDD FR1-NTN bands defined in Table 5.2-1

F~REF,\ shift~ = F~REF~ + Δ~shift~, Δ~shift~ = 0 kHz or 7.5 kHz.

where Δ~shift~ is signalled by the network in higher layer parameter
*frequencyShift7p5khz* \[7\].

The mapping between the *channel raster* and corresponding resource
element is given in clause 5.4.2.2. The applicable entries for each
*operating band* are defined in clause 5.4.2.3.

#### 5.4.2.1A NB-IoT carrier frequency numbering

The NB-IoT carrier frequency numbering (EARFCN) is defined in clause
5.4B of TS 36.108 \[17\].

\[NOTE: Signalling of Δ~shift~ = 7.5 kHz for the uplink of the FDD FR1
NTN channel can ensure co-existence between the in-band NB-IoT and
associated NR NTN channels.\]

#### 5.4.2.2 Channel raster to resource element mapping

The mapping between the *RF reference frequency* on the channel raster
and the corresponding resource element is given in table 5.4.2.2-1 and
can be used to identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on
the total number of RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to
both UL and DL. The mapping must apply to at least one numerology
supported by the SAN.

is the resource element index within this PRB.

#### 5.4.2.3 Channel raster entries for each *operating band*

The RF channel positions on the channel raster in each SAN *operating
band* are given through the applicable NR-ARFCN in table 5.4.2.3-1 for
FR1-NTN and table 5.4.2.3-3 for FR2-NTN, using the channel raster to
resource element mapping in clause 5.4.2.2.

For SAN *operating bands* with 100 kHz channel raster, ΔF~Raster~ = 20 ×
ΔF~Global~. In this case, every 20^th^ NR-ARFCN within the *operating
band* are applicable for the channel raster within the *operating band*
and the step size for the channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as
\<20\>.

For SAN *operating bands* with 60 kHz channel raster above 3 GHz,
ΔF~Raster~ = *I* ×ΔF~Global~, where *I* ϵ {4, 8}. In this case, every
*I^th^* NR‑ARFCN within the *operating band* are applicable for the
channel raster within the *operating band* and the step size for the
channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-3 is given as \<*I*\>.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster

#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering

The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition
when explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not
present.

A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The
frequency position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with
corresponding number GSCN. The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN
for all the frequency ranges are in table 5.4.3.1-1.

The resource element corresponding to the SS block reference frequency
SS~REF~ is given in clause 5.4.3.2. The synchronization raster and the
subcarrier spacing of the synchronization block are defined separately
for each band.

The synchronization raster and the corresponding SS block do not cover
all possible RF channel bandwidth and locations on *enhanced channel
raster*.

### 6.3.4 NB-IoT RB power dynamic range for NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band

#### 6.3.4.1 General

The NB-IoT RB power dynamic range (or NB-IoT power boosting) is the
difference between the average power of NB-IoT REs (which occupy certain
REs within a NR transmission bandwidth configuration plus 15 kHz at each
edge but not within the NR minimum guard band GB~Channel~) and the
average power over all REs (from both NB-IoT and the NR carrier
containing the NB-IoT REs).

#### 6.3.4.2 Minimum Requirement

6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
-------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

6.5 Transmitted signal quality
------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Frequency error

#### 6.5.1.1 General

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual SAN
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

For *SAN type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The modulated carrier frequency of each carrier configured by the SAN
shall be accurate to within 0.05 ppm observed over 1 ms.

The frequency error requirements for NB-IoT are specified in TS 36.108
\[17\] clause 6.5.1.

### 6.5.2 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.2.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector. Details about how the EVM is determined are specified in Annex
B.

For *SAN type 1-H,* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The EVM levels of each carrier for different modulation schemes on PDSCH
outlined in table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be met using the frame structure
described in clause 6.5.2.3.

Table 6.5.2.2-1: EVM requirements for *SAN type 1-H* carrier

  Modulation scheme for PDSCH                                                         Required EVM

  NOTE: EVM requirement for 64QAM is optional, subject to manufacturer declaration.   

The modulation quality requirements for NB-IoT are specified in TS
36.108 \[17\] clause 6.5.2.

#### 6.5.2.3 EVM frame structure for measurement

EVM shall be evaluated for each carrier over all allocated resource
blocks and downlink subframes. Different modulation schemes listed in
table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

For all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for each
carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink subframes within
10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM measurement periods
need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

### 6.5.3 Time alignment error 

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[2\]. In ITU terminology, out of
band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the *SAN
channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the SAN transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and out-of-band emissions (OOBE). There is in addition a requirement for
occupied bandwidth.

Table 6.6.1-1: void

For *SAN type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied to sum
of power over all *TAB connectors* for all the configurations supported
by the SAN, except for occupied bandwidth in subclause 6.6.2.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[8\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also
be regional requirements to declare the occupied bandwidth according to
the definition in the present clause.

For SAN *type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the *SAN
channel bandwidth*.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the occupied bandwidth for each
NR carrier with NB-IoT shall be less than the *SAN channel bandwidth*.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.6.3.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth* or *Radio
Bandwidth* whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier
or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer's specification.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.6.3.2-1/2.

### 6.6.4 Out-of-band emissions

#### 6.6.4.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the out-of-band emission (OOBE) limits for SAN
in FR1-NTN are defined from BW~SAN~ channel edge up to frequencies
separated from the BW~SAN~ channel edge by 200% of the *necessary
bandwidth*, where the *necessary bandwidth* is BW~SAN~.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification.

*Basic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the BW~SAN~ *channel edge* frequency and
the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- $\Delta_{Sat\_ Class}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack$ is the
*SAN class parameter* in dB identified to characterize different SAN
classes.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 6.6.4.2 *Basic limits*

For SAN operating in bands defined in clause 5.2, the out-of-band
emissions (OOBE) *requirements* are specified in table 6.6.4.2-1 for GEO
and LEO class, in line with Annex 5 of ITU recommendation SM.1541-6

#### 6.6.4.3 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The out-of-band emissions minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H* are
that the power summation emissions at the *TAB connectors* shall not
exceed the *basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 General

The transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 30 MHz to the
fifth harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the DL operating band,
excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and the frequency
range where the out-of-band emissions apply. For some *operating bands*,
the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the
5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating band*, as specified in
ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[2\].

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 6.6.5.2 *Basic limits*

##### 6.6.5.2.1 General transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *requirements in* table 6.6.5.2.1-1 shall apply. The application of
those limits shall be the same as for out-of-band emissions in clause
6.6.4.

##### 6.6.5.2.2 Protection of the own Satellite Access Node receiver 

This requirement shall be applied for NR FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of the SAN being de-sensitized by emissions from
its own SAN transmitter. It is measured at the *TAB connector* for *SAN
type 1-H* for any type of SAN which has common or separate Tx/Rx *TAB
connectors*.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.2.2-1.

Table 6.6.5.2.2-1: SAN spurious emissions *basic limits* for protection
of the SAN receiver

  Frequency range           *Basic limits*   *Measurement bandwidth*
  ------------------------- ---------------- -------------------------
  F~UL,low~ -- F~UL,high~   -96 dBm          100 kHz

##### 6.6.5.2.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

The additional spurious emissions requirement is not applicable for SAN.

##### 6.6.5.2.4 Co-location with other Satellite Access Nodes

The co-location requirement is not applicable for SAN.

#### 6.6.5.3 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The transmitter spurious emissions minimum requirements for *SAN type
1-H* are that that the power summation emissions at the *TAB connectors*
shall not exceed the *basic limit* in clause 6.6.5.2.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at the *TAB connector*
for *SAN type 1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge
or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*, and the positive offsets
of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper *SAN RF Bandwidth*
edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*.

\- Requirements shall also apply for SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in
NTN NR in-band. The corresponding NB-IoT requirements are specified in
TS 36.108 \[17\] clause 7.

NOTE: In normal operating condition the SAN is configured to transmit
and receive at the same time.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level 
-------------------------------

### 7.2.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* at which a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-1 and 7.2.2-2 for *SAN type 1-H* in all operating band in
FR1-NTN.

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

### 7.3.1 General

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* inside the received
*SAN* channel bandwidth. In this condition, a throughput requirement
shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel. The
interfering signal for the dynamic range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-1 for LEO.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in Annex A of TS 36.108 \[17\] with parameters specified in table
7.3.1-1a for LEO SAN.

7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
*TAB connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent
channel signal with a specified center frequency offset of the
interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For SAN, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *SAN type
1-H* *TAB connector* are specified in table 7.4.1.2-1 and the frequency
offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2 for
ACS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in table 7.2.2-1 and 7.2.2-2 for each *SAN channel bandwidth*
in any operating band and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
C.

For SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the wanted and
the interfering signal coupled to the *SAN* *type 1-H* *TAB connector*
are specified in table 7.4.1.2-1 and the frequency offset between the
wanted and interfering signal in table 7.4.1.2-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 of TS 36.108 \[17\]. The characteristics of the interfering
signal is further specified in annex C.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *SAN RF Bandwidth* edges or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *SAN
type 1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking
------------------------

### 7.5.1 General

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB
connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer
out of the *operating band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band
blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*SAN type 1-H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in table 7.5.2-1.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 for each *SAN channel bandwidth* and further specified in
annex A.1.

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at *TAB
connector* for *SAN type 1-H* in the presence of an interfering signal
received at a larger power spectral density. In this condition a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be an NR signal which
is time aligned with the wanted signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirements for *SAN type 1-H*

For *SAN type* *1-H*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.8.2-1 for GEO SAN, in table
7.8.2-2 for LEO SAN. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex C.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the NB-IoT reference measurement channel as
specified in Annex A of TS 36.108 \[17\] with parameters specified in
table 7.8.2-1a for SAN GEO and in table 7.8.2-2a for SAN LEO.

8 Conducted performance requirements
====================================

8.1 General
-----------

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *SAN type
1-H* to correctly transmit and receive signals in various conditions and
configurations. Conducted performance requirements are specified at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *SAN type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the SAN are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and for the propagation
conditions defined in Recommendation ITU-R P.618 (*Propagation data and
prediction methods required for the design of Earth-space
telecommunication systems*).

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a SAN supporting *carrier
aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *TAB connectors* (for *SAN type 1-H*)
in the *operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions, *TAB connectors* (for *SAN type
1-H*) in FDD operation are configured to transmit and receive at the
same time. The associated transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the
tests as specified in TS 38.181 \[3\].

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

*S* is the total signal power in the slot on a single on a single *TAB
connector* (for *SAN type 1-H*).

*N* is the noise density integrated in a bandwidth corresponding to the
*transmission bandwidth* over the same duration where signal energy
exists on a single *TAB connector* (for *SAN type 1-H)*.

8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

#### 8.2.2.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

### 8.2.3 Requirements for UL timing adjustment

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Table A.3-1 are applied for both UEs. The received power
for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are
consecutive.

### 8.2.4 Requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

#### 8.2.4.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a maximum block
error probability (BLER) for a given SNR. The BLER is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the PUSCH information when the PUSCH
information is sent. The performance requirements assume HARQ
re-transmissions.

### 8.2.5 Requirements for PUSCH with DM-RS bundling

#### 8.2.5.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 DTX to ACK probability

#### 8.3.1.1 General

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing was sent:

$\text{Prob}\left( \text{PUCCH\ DTX} \rightarrow \text{Ack\ bits} \right) = \ \frac{\#(\text{false}\ \text{ACK}\ \text{bits})}{\#\left( \text{PUCCH\ DTX} \right)*\#(\text{ACK}/\text{NACK}\ \text{bits})}$

where:

\- \#(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.

\- \#(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per slot

\- \#(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions

#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability shall not exceed 1% for all PUCCH formats
carrying ACK/NACK bits:

$\text{Prob}\left( \text{PUCCH\ DTX} \rightarrow \text{Ack\ bits} \right)\  \leq \ 10^{- 2}$

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

#### 8.3.2.1 General

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK was sent.

Table 8.3.2.1-1: Test Parameters

  Parameter                              Test
  -------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Number of UCI information bits         1
  Number of PRBs                         1
  First PRB prior to frequency hopping   0
  Intra-slot frequency hopping           Enabled
  First PRB after frequency hopping      The largest PRB index -- (Number of PRBs-- 1)
  Group and sequence hopping             neither
  Hopping ID                             0
  Initial cyclic shift                   0
  First symbol                           12 for 2 symbols

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[11\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

#### 8.3.2.2 Minimum requirements

The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR
given in table 8.3.2.2-1 and in table 8.3.2.2-2.

### 8.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

#### 8.3.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.3.3.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./media/image13.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"},

where:

\- ![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.1805555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./media/image15.wmf){width="2.048611111111111in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

### 8.3.6 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

#### 8.3.6.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 \[11\] clause 6.3.3 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is
enabled.

### 8.3.7 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH

#### 8.3.7.1 General

#### 8.3.7.2 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1

##### 8.3.7.2.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.3.7.2.1.1 General {#general-36 .H6}

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when a NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./media/image13.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"},

where:

\- ![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.1805555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./media/image15.wmf){width="2.048611111111111in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e., the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e., NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
--------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability

#### 8.4.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements

#### 8.4.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN, NTN-TDLA100-200, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the
strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance given in Table
8.4.2.1-1.

The test preambles are listed in table A.4 and the test parameter
*msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

#### 8.4.2.2 Minimum requirements

The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in Tables 8.4.2.2-1 to 8.4.2.2-3.

9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

9.1 General
-----------

Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the *SAN type
1-H or* *SAN type 1-O* including all its functional components active
and for all foreseen modes of operation of the SAN unless otherwise
stated.

NOTE: For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the NR carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth.
The radiated transmitter characteristics in this section apply to all
such carriers which may hae NB-IoT operating in band.

9.2 Radiated transmit power
---------------------------

### 9.2.1 General

*SAN type 1-H, SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O* are declared to support
one or more beams, as per manufacturer\'s declarations specified in TS
38.181 \[3\]. Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a
declared beam at a specific *beam peak direction*.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, beamwidth, *rated beam EIRP*,
*OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the maximum
steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
beamwidth(s).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the SAN is declared to radiate at the
associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter ON period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in TS 38.181 \[3\].

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O*

For each declared beam, in normal conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within ±2.2
dB of the claimed value.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.181, annex B \[3\].

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

NOTE: For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the NR carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth,
the output power over this carrier is shared between NR and NB-IoT. This
note shall apply for P~max,c,TRP~ and P~rated,c,TRP~.

### 9.2.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

For each declared beam, in normal conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within ± 3.4
dB of the claimed value.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.181, annex B \[3\].

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

9.3 OTA Satellite Access Node output power
------------------------------------------

### 9.3.1 General

OTA SAN output power is declared as the TRP radiated requirement, with
the output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB. TRP does not
change with beamforming settings as long as the *beam peak direction* is
within the *OTA peak directions set*. Thus the TRP accuracy requirement
must be met for any beamforming setting for which the *beam peak
direction* is within the *OTA peak directions set*.

The SAN *rated carrier TRP output power* for *SAN type 1-O and SAN type
2-O* shall be based on manufacturer declaration.

Despite the general requirements for the SAN output power described in
clause 9.3.2, additional regional requirements might be applicable.

NOTE: For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the NR carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth,
the output power over this carrier is shared between NR and NB-IoT. This
note shall apply for P~max,c,TRP~ and P~rated,c,TRP~.

### 9.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

In normal conditions, the *SAN type 1-O* *maximum carrier TRP output
power*, P~max,c~,~TRP~ measured at the RIB shall remain within ±2 dB of
the *rated carrier TRP output power* P~rated,c,TRP~, as declared by the
manufacturer.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.181 \[3\], annex B.

### 9.3.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

In normal conditions, the *SAN type 2-O* *maximum carrier TRP output
power*, P~max,c~,~TRP~ measured at the RIB shall remain within ±3 dB of
the *rated carrier TRP output power* P~rated,c,TRP~, as declared by the
manufacturer.

Normal conditions are defined in TS 38.181, annex B \[3\].

9.4 OTA output power dynamics
-----------------------------

### 9.4.1 General

Transmit signal quality (as specified in clause 9.6) shall be maintained
for the output power dynamics requirements.

The OTA output power requirements are *directional requirements* and
apply to the *beam peak directions* over the *OTA peak directions set*.

### 9.4.2 OTA RE power control dynamic range

#### 9.4.2.1 General

The OTA RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the
power of an RE and the average RE power for a SAN at maximum output
power (P~max,c,EIRP~) for a specified reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

#### 9.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The OTA RE power control dynamic range is specified the same as the
conducted RE power control dynamic range requirement for *SAN type 1-H*
in table 6.3.2.2-1.

### 9.4.3 OTA total power dynamic range

#### 9.4.3.1 General

The OTA total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum
and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

NOTE 1: The upper limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the SAN
maximum carrier EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) when transmitting on all RBs. The
lower limit of the OTA total power dynamic range is the average EIRP for
single RB transmission in the same direction using the same beam. The
OFDM symbol carries PDSCH and not contain RS or SSB.

#### 9.4.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

OTA total power dynamic range minimum requirement for SAN type 1-O is
specified such as for each NR carrier it shall be larger than or equal
to the levels specified for the conducted requirement for *SAN type 1-H*
in table 6.3.3.2-1.

#### 9.4.3.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

OTA total power dynamic range minimum requirement for SAN *type 2-O* is
specified such as for each NR carrier it shall be larger than or equal
to the levels specified in table 9.4.3.3-1 in FR2-NTN.

  ------- ------------------------------------ --------- --------- ---------

### 9.4.4 NB-IoT RB power dynamic range for NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band

#### 9.4.4.1 General

The NB-IoT RB power dynamic range (or NB-IoT power boosting) is the
difference between the average power of NB-IoT REs (which occupy certain
REs within a NR transmission bandwidth configuration plus 15 kHz at each
edge but not within the NR minimum guard band GB~Channel~) and the
average power over all REs (from both NB-IoT and the NR carrier
containing the NB-IoT REs).

#### 9.4.4.2 Minimum Requirement

NB-IoT RB power dynamic range for NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band
shall be larger than or equal to the level specified in Table 6.3.4.2-1.
This power dynamic range level is only required for one NB-IoT RB.

-----------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

9.6 OTA transmitted signal quality
----------------------------------

### 9.6.1 OTA frequency error

#### 9.6.1.1 General

OTA frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual
SAN transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall
be used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

OTA frequency error requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

#### 9.6.1.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

For *SAN type 1-O*, the modulated carrier frequency of each carrier
configured by the SAN shall be accurate to within 0.05 ppm observed over
1 ms.

The frequency error requirement for NB-IoT are specified in TS 36.108
\[17\] clause 9.6.1.2.

#### 9.6.1.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

For *SAN type 2-O*, the modulated carrier frequency of each carrier
configured by the SAN shall be accurate to within 0.05 ppm observed over
1 ms.

### 9.6.2 OTA modulation quality

#### 9.6.2.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). Details about how the EVM is
determined are specified in annex B for FR1-NTN.

OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *directional
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

#### 9.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

For *SAN type 1-O*, the EVM levels of each carrier for different
modulation schemes on PDSCH outlined in table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be met.
Requirements shall be the same as clause 6.5.2.2 and follow EVM frame
structure from clause 6.5.2.3.

The modulation quality requirements for NB-IoT are specified in TS
36.108 \[17\] clause 9.6.2.2.

#### 9.6.2.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

##### 9.6.2.3.1 EVM frame structure for measurement

For *SAN type 2-O*, the EVM levels of each carrier for different
modulation schemes on PDSCH outlined in table 9.6.2.3.1-1 shall be met.

Table 9.6.2.3-1: EVM requirements for *SAN type 2-O* carrier

  Applicability   Modulation scheme for PDSCH   Required EVM (%)
  --------------- ----------------------------- ------------------
  FR2-NTN         QPSK                          17.5
  FR2-NTN         16QAM                         12.5
  FR2-NTN         64QAM                         8

##### 9.6.2.3.2 EVM frame structure for measurement

EVM requirements shall apply for each carrier over all allocated
resource blocks. Different modulation schemes listed in table
9.6.2.3.1-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

### 9.6.3 OTA time alignment error

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

9.7 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 9.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[2\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *SAN channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *SAN type 1-O* is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and out-of-band emissions (OOBE). The unwanted emission requirements are
applied per cell for all the configurations. Requirements for OTA
unwanted emissions are captured as TRP requirements or *directional
requirements*, as described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 9.7.2.1 General

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[8\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also
be regional requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according
to the definition in the present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the occupied bandwidth for each
NR carrier with NB-IoT shall be less than the *SAN channel bandwidth*.

#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* and *SAN type 2-O*

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the *SAN
channel bandwidth*.

### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 9.7.3.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 9.7.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The ACLR limit specified in tables 6.6.3.2-1 for SAN GEO class and
6.6.3.2-2 for SAN LEO class shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier, the ACLR requirements in clause
6.6.3.2 shall apply to *SAN channel bandwidths* of the outermost carrier
for the frequency ranges defined in tables 6.6.3.2-1 and 6.6.3.2-2.

#### 9.7.3.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

The ACLR limit specified in tables 9.7.3.3-1 for SAN GEO class and
9.7.3.3-2 for SAN LEO class shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier, the ACLR requirements in clause
9.7.3.3 shall apply to *SAN channel bandwidths* of the outermost carrier
for the frequency ranges defined in tables 9.7.3.3-1 and 9.7.3.3-2.

### 9.7.4 OTA out-of-band emissions

#### 9.7.4.1 General

The OTA limits for out-of-band emissions are specified as TRP per RIB
unless otherwise stated.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

Out-of-band emissions in FR1-NTN are limited by OTA out-of-band emission
limits. Unless otherwise stated, the out-of-band emission limits in
FR1-NTN are defined from channel edge up to frequencies separated from
the channel edge by 200% of the necessary bandwidth. The requirements
shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and for all
transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. For a
*RIB* operating in multi-carrier, the requirements apply to *SAN channel
bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in
clause 6.6.4.1.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for SAN type 1-O shall not
exceed each applicable limit in clause 6.6.4.2.

#### 9.7.4.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

Out-of-band emissions in FR2-NTN are limited by OTA out-of-band emission
limits. Unless otherwise stated, the out-of-band emission limits in
FR2-NTN are defined from channel edge up to frequencies separated from
the channel edge by 200% of the necessary bandwidth. The requirements
shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and for all
transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. For a
*RIB* operating in multi-carrier, the requirements apply to *SAN channel
bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in
clause 6.6.4.1.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for SAN type 2-O shall not
exceed each applicable limit in clause 6.6.4.2.

### 9.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 9.7.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per RIB unless
otherwise stated.

The requirements shall also apply if the SAN supports NB-IoT operation
in NTN NR in-band.

#### 9.7.5.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

##### 9.7.5.2.1 General

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1-NTN shall apply
from 30 MHz to the 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the DL
operating band, excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and
the frequency range where the out-of-band emissions apply.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

##### 9.7.5.2.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *basic limits* of table 9.7.5.2.2-1 shall apply. The application of
those limits shall be the same as for out-of-band emissionsin clause
6.6.4.

##### 9.7.5.3.1 General

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR2-NTN shall apply
from 30 MHz to the 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the DL
operating band, excluding the *SAN transponder bandwidth* BW~SAN~ and
the frequency range where the out-of-band emissions apply.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

#### 9.7.5.3.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *basic limits* of table 9.7.5.3.2-1 shall apply. The application of
those limits shall be the same as for operating band unwanted emissions
in clause 9.7.4.3.

##### 9.7.5.3.3 Protection of the SAN receiver

The co-location requirement is not applicable for SAN in this version of
the specification.

##### 9.7.5.3.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

The additional spurious emissions requirement is not applicable for SAN.

9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.

10 Radiated receiver characteristics
====================================

10.1 General
------------

Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for *SAN type 1-H
or* *SAN type 1-O or SAN type 2-O*, with full complement of transceivers
for the configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the
radiated receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge,
and the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the
upper *SAN RF Bandwidth* edge.

\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

\- Requirements shall also apply for SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in
NTN NR in-band. The corresponding NB-IoT requirements are specified in
TS 36.108 \[17\] clause 10.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the SAN in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

For FR1-NTN requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS
RoAoA* absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for the reference direction

and

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for all other directions

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

For FR2-NTN requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS
RoAoA* absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction

and

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions

10.2 OTA sensitivity
--------------------

#### 10.2.1 General

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a *directional requirement* based
upon the declaration of one or more *OTA sensitivity direction
declarations* (OSDD), related to a *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O*
receiver.

The *SAN type 1-H* and *SAN type 1-O* may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of adjusting SAN
settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity
RoAoA* resulting from the current SAN settings is the active
*sensitivity RoAoA*.

If the SAN is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- *SAN channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target redirection
range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the SAN.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 38.181 \[3\].

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

If the SAN is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related
to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *SAN channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS
level applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 3: For SAN without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described in clause 7.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving
signal is equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set
of EIS level and *SAN channel bandwidth*.

10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 General {#general-58 .list-paragraph}

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a *directional requirement* and is
intended to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a
declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O* {#minimum-requirement-for-san-type-1-o-9 .list-paragraph}

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

### 10.3.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS\_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *SAN channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ itself is not a
requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *SAN channel bandwidth* it does not imply that SAN has to
support 50 MHz *SAN channel bandwidth*.

For GEO class SAN, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
\[-140\] to \[-149\] dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For LEO class SAN, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
\[-120\] to \[-129\] dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

10.4 OTA dynamic range
----------------------

10.4.1 General
--------------

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *SAN channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.4.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 10.4.2-1 for LEO SAN.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified
in Annex A of TS 36.108 \[17\] with parameters specified in table
10.4.2-1a for LEO SAN.

This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *SAN channel bandwidth*.

10.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking
-----------------------------------------

### 10.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 10.5.1.1 General

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system.

#### 10.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1-NTN, the OTA wanted signal and the interfering signal are
specified in table 10.5.1.2-1 and table 10.5.1.2-2 for OTA ACS. The
reference measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further
specified in annex A.1. The characteristic of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex C.

For SAN supporting NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the wanted and
the interfering signal at the *SAN* *type 1-O* *RIB* are specified in
table 10.5.1.2-1 and the frequency offset between the wanted and
interfering signal in table 10.5.1.2-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the NB-IoT wanted signal is identified in
clause 10.3.2 of TS 36.108 \[17\]. The characteristics of the
interfering signal is further specified in annex C.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *SAN RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*.

#### 10.5.1.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2-NTN, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.3-1 and table 10.5.1.3-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex D.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *SAN RF Bandwidth*.
The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the SAN *RF
Bandwidth edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 10.5.1.3-2. The OTA
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.* The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each *SAN channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For *SAN type 1-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.2-1 for GEO SAN, in table
10.9.2-2 for LEO SAN. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex C.

For NB-IoT operation in NTN NR in-band, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the NB-IoT reference measurement channel as
specified in Annex A of TS 36.108 \[17\] with parameters specified in
table 10.9.2-1a for SAN GEO and in table 10.9.2-2a for SAN LEO.

### 10.9.3 Minimum requirement for *SAN type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For SAN *type 2-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 10.9.3-1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex D.

11 Radiated performance requirements
====================================

11.1 General
------------

### 11.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *SAN type
1-O or SAN type 2-O* to correctly transmit and receive radiated signals
in various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance
requirements are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the SAN are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined inannex A and for the propagation
conditions defined in Recommendation ITU-R P.618 (*Propagation data and
prediction methods required for the design of Earth-space
telecommunication systems*). The requirements only apply to those FRCs
that are supported by the SAN.

The radiated performance requirements for *SAN type 1-O and for SAN type
2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulation branches* as described in
clause 11.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches* depending on the number of polarizations
supported by the SAN, with the required SNR applied separately per
polarization.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a SAN
supporting carrier aggregation are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements.

For *SAN type 1-O* in FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall
be met with the transmitter units associated with the RIB in the
*operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE 1: *SAN type 1-O* in normal operating conditions in FDD operation
is configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the tests as
specified in TS 38.181\[3\].

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided from the SAN to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

*S* is the total signal power in a slot on a RIB.

*N* is the noise density integrated in a bandwidth corresponding to the
*transmission bandwidth* over the duration where signal energy exists on
a RIB.

### 11.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *SAN type 1-O or the SAN type 2-O* uses polarization diversity
and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each
of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX
test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*, each
demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *SAN type 1-O or the SAN type 2-O* does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for
a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

11.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
---------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 Requirements for *SAN type 1-O*

#### 11.2.1.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.1.

#### 11.2.1.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.2.

#### 11.2.1.3 Requirements for UL timing adjustment

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.3.

#### 11.2.1.4 Requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.4.

#### 11.2.1.5 Requirements for PUSCH with DM-RS bundling

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.2.5.

### 11.2.2 Requirements for *SAN type 2-O*

#### 11.2.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

##### 11.2.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

##### 11.3.2.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

###### 11.3.2.3.1.1 General

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](./media/image13.wmf){width="4.201388888888889in"
height="0.4027777777777778in"}

where:

\- ![](./media/image14.wmf){width="1.2013888888888888in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](./media/image15.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.2013888888888889in"}
denotes the number of NACK bits decoded as ACK bits at the receiver,
i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

11.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
---------------------------------------

### 11.4.1 Requirements for SAN type 1-O

#### 11.4.1.1 PRACH False alarm probability

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.4.1.

#### 11.4.1.2 PRACH detection requirements

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.4.2.

### 11.4.2 Requirements for SAN type 2-O

#### 11.4.2.1 PRACH False alarm probability

##### 11.4.2.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

##### 11.4.2.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

#### 11.4.2.2 PRACH detection requirements

##### 11.4.2.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For NTN-TDLC5-1200, a timing estimation
error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path
is larger than the time error tolerance given in Table 11.4.2.2.1-1.

Table 11.4.2.2.1-1: Time error tolerance for NTN-TDLC5-1200

+----------+-----------+----------------------+
| PRACH    | PRACH SCS | Time error tolerance |
|          |           |                      |
| preamble | (kHz)     |                      |

######## Annex B (normative): Error Vector Magnitude (FR1-NTN)

B.1 Reference point for measurement {#b.1-reference-point-for-measurement .list-paragraph}
===================================

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure B.1-1 below.

Figure B.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

B.2 Basic unit of measurement {#b.2-basic-unit-of-measurement .list-paragraph}
=============================

The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one slot in the time
domain and subcarriers in the frequency domain:

where

*T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

is the set of subcarriers within the subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

*is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in
accordance with relevant Tx models,

is the modified signal under test defined in annex B.3.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals. The boundaries of the 10 ms measurement
intervals need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

B.3 Modified signal under test {#b.3-modified-signal-under-test .list-paragraph}
==============================

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalized and decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal. Note that two timing
offsets are determined, the corresponding EVM is measured and the
maximum used as described in annex B.7.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

B.4 Estimation of frequency offset {#b.4-estimation-of-frequency-offset .list-paragraph}
==================================

The observation period for determining the frequency offset shall be 1
slot.

B.5 Estimation of time offset {#b.5-estimation-of-time-offset .list-paragraph}
=============================

B.5.1 General {#b.5.1-general .list-paragraph}
-------------

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
shall be 1 slot.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length *W* (defined in annex B.5.2) or the last sample of the first
window half if *W* is even.

is estimated so that the EVM window of length *W* is centred on the
measured cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To minimize the
estimation error the timing shall be based on demodulation reference
signals. To limit time distortion of any transmit filter the reference
signals in the 1 outer RBs are not taken into account in the timing
estimation

Two values for are determined:

and

where if *W* is odd and if *W* is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol then *T*
shall be further restricted to the subset of symbols with the considered
modulation scheme being active and with the considered cyclic prefix
length type.

B.5.2 Window length {#b.5.2-window-length .list-paragraph}
-------------------

Table B.5.2-1, B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 specify the EVM window length (*W*) for
normal CP.

B.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters {#b.6-estimation-of-tx-chain-amplitude-and-frequency-response-parameters .list-paragraph}
======================================================================

The equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image36.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"}and
![](./media/image37.wmf){width="0.4097222222222222in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image38.wmf){width="0.5555555555555556in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} and the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image39.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"}, for each reference signal, over 10ms
measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image40.wmf){width="1.7708333333333333in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

Where the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image39.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters: i.e. nominal demodulation reference signals, (all
other modulation symbols are set to 0 V), nominal carrier frequency,
nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier, nominal
timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10ms measurement interval.
Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image41.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in" height="0.25in"}
an unwrap operation must be performed according to the following
definition: The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
![](./media/image42.wmf){width="0.5347222222222222in" height="0.25in"}
by adding multiples of 2\*PI when absolute phase jumps between
consecutive time instances t~i~ are greater than or equal to the jump
tolerance of PI radians. This process creates an average amplitude and
phase for each reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second
subcarrier).

![](./media/image43.wmf){width="1.2986111111111112in"
height="0.6458333333333334in"}

![](./media/image44.wmf){width="1.3541666666666667in"
height="0.6458333333333334in"}

Where *N* is the number of reference signal; time-domain locations
*t~i~* from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each reference signal subcarrier
![](./media/image45.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"}.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image46.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.24305555555555555in"}
and ![](./media/image47.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} at the reference signal subcarriers are
obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every second
subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over
the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or
near the edge of the channel , or when the number of available DM-RS
subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than
the moving average window size, the window size is reduced accordingly
as per figure B.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
![](./media/image46.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.24305555555555555in"}
and ![](./media/image47.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.24305555555555555in"} to compute coefficients
![](./media/image48.wmf){width="0.3819444444444444in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"},
![](./media/image49.wmf){width="0.4097222222222222in"
height="0.2152777777777778in"} for each subcarrier.

Figure B.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain

B.7 Averaged EVM {#b.7-averaged-evm .list-paragraph}
================

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval.

For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the $N_{\text{dl}}$ slot
duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation
step.

![](./media/image51.wmf){width="2.2847222222222223in"
height="0.7777777777777778in"}

*- Where Ni* is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

\- The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

\- Thus ![](./media/image52.wmf){width="0.7152777777777778in"
height="0.25in"} is calculated using
![](./media/image53.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"}in the
expressions above and
![](./media/image54.wmf){width="0.7569444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is calculated using
![](./media/image55.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"} in the
![](./media/image56.wmf){width="0.6805555555555556in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"} calculation.

\- Thus we get:

$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

######## Annex C (normative): Characteristics of the interfering signals

The interfering signal shall be a PUSCH or PDSCH containing data and
DM-RS symbols. Normal cyclic prefix is used. The data content shall be
uncorrelated to the wanted signal and modulated according to clause 6 of
TS 38.211 \[9\]. Mapping of PUSCH or PDSCH modulation to receiver
requirement are specified in table C-1.

######## Annex D (Normative): Propagation conditions

D.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

D.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

D.2.1 Delay profiles
--------------------

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.811 \[13\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in G.2.1.1 can be used as such.

> \- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.811 \[13\].
>
> \- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays
>
> \- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described
> in clause 7.7.2 in TR 38.901 \[12\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple Rayleigh taps are rounded to the same delay bin,
merge them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there is a LOS path in the model, the power for all paths
could be slightly adjusted to keep the RMS delay spread is close to
target delay spread and mean power is 0dB.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest Rayleigh tap to 0 dB when there is
no LOS path in the model.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2, G.2.1.1-3 and
G.2.1.2-2 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

D.2.3 MIMO channel correlation matrices
---------------------------------------

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex D.2.3 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear arrays at both SAN and UE
and for the antenna configuration using cross polarized antennas.

### D.2.3.1 MIMO correlation matrices using Uniform Linear Array

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex D.2.3.1 apply for
the antenna configuration using uniform linear array (ULA) at both SAN
and UE.

#### D.2.3.1.1 Definition of MIMO correlation matrices

Table D.2.3.1.1-1 defines the correlation matrix for the SAN.

SAN and UE respectively.

             \end{bmatrix}$$

For cases with more antennas at either SAN or UE or both, the channel
spatial correlation matrix can still be expressed as the Kronecker
product of $R_{\text{UE}}$ and $R_{\text{SAN}}\ $according to
${R_{\text{spat}} = \ R_{\text{UE}} \otimes R}_{\text{SAN}}$.

low correlation.

D.3 Moving propagation conditions
=================================

Figure D.3-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test
of the UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the
reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (D.3-1). The
timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ -
(*T~A~* −31)×16×64*T~c~* for 15kHz SCS, Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×32*T~c~*
for 30kHz SCS and Δτ - (*T~A~* −31)×16×8*T~c~* for 120kHz SCS. The
relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table D.3-1.

######## Annex E (normative): Error Vector Magnitude (FR2-NTN)

E.1 Reference point for measurement {#e.1-reference-point-for-measurement .list-paragraph}
===================================

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in figure E.1-1 below.

Figure E.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

E.2 Basic unit of measurement
=============================

The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one slot in the time
domain and subcarriers in the frequency domain:

where

is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the slot,

is the set of subcarriers within the subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

*is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in
accordance with relevant Tx models,

is the modified signal under test defined in E.3.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over 10 ms measurement intervals to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals. The boundaries of the 10 ms measurement
intervals need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

E.3 Modified signal under test
==============================

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalized and decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal. Note that two timing
offsets are determined, the corresponding EVM is measured and the
maximum used as described in E.7.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

E.4 Estimation of frequency offset
==================================

The observation period for determining the frequency offset shall be 1
slot.

E.5 Estimation of time offset
=============================

E.5.1 General
-------------

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
shall be 1 slot.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length (defined in E.5.2) or the last sample of the first window half if
is even.

is estimated so that the EVM window of length is centred on the measured
cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To minimize the estimation
error the timing shall be based on the reference signals. To limit time
distortion of any transmit filter the reference signals in the 1 outer
RBs are not taken into account in the timing estimation

Two values for are determined:

and

where if is odd and if is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol then shall be
further restricted to the subset of symbols with the considered
modulation scheme being active and with the considered cyclic prefix
length type.

E.5.2 Window length

![](./media/image37.wmf){width="0.40555555555555556in"
height="0.21666666666666667in"} are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal ![](./media/image38.wmf){width="0.5569444444444445in"
height="0.21666666666666667in"} and the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image39.wmf){width="0.5375in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}, for each reference signal, over 10ms
measurement intervals. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

![](./media/image40.wmf){width="1.7638888888888888in" height="0.4625in"}

Where the post-FFT ideal signal
![](./media/image39.wmf){width="0.5375in" height="0.2361111111111111in"}
is constructed by the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX
specifications, using the following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals and nominal PT-RS if present
(all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10ms measurement interval.
Prior to the averaging of the phases
![](./media/image93.wmf){width="0.5284722222222222in"
height="0.2548611111111111in"} an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition: The unwrap operation corrects the
radian phase angles of
![](./media/image94.wmf){width="0.5284722222222222in"
height="0.2548611111111111in"} by adding multiples of 2\*PI when
absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances t~i~ are greater
than or equal to the jump tolerance of PI radians. This process creates
an average amplitude and phase for each reference signal subcarrier
(i.e. every second subcarrier).

$${a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}
}{\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}}$$

Where *N* is the number of reference signal time-domain locations *t~i~*
from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each reference signal subcarrier
![](./media/image45.wmf){width="0.1701388888888889in"
height="0.21666666666666667in"}.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
![](./media/image95.wmf){width="0.3770833333333333in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} and
![](./media/image96.wmf){width="0.38680555555555557in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} at the reference signal subcarriers are
obtained by computing the moving average in the frequency domain of the
time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every second
subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over
the DM-RS subcarriers in allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near
the edge of the channel, or when the number of available DM-RS
subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than
the moving average window size, the window size is reduced accordingly
as per figure C.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients

common phase error (CPE) experienced in millimetre wave frequencies,
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$, in the estimated coefficients contain phase
rotation due to the CPE, $\theta$, in addition to the phase of the
equalizer coefficient $\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$, that is

$$\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) + \theta(t)$$

For OFDM symbols where PT-RS does not exist, $\theta(t)$ can be
estimated by performing linear interpolation from neighboring symbols
where PT-RS is present.

In order to separate component of the CPE,$\text{\ θ}$, contained in,
$\overline{\varphi}(f)$, estimation and compensation of the CPE needs to
follow.$\ \theta(t)$ is the common phase error (CPE), that rotates all
the subcarriers of the OFDM symbol at time $t$.

Estimate of the CPE, $\theta(t)$, at OFDM symbol time, $t$, can then be
obtained from using the PT-RS employing the expression

$$\widetilde{\theta}(t) = \arg\left\{ \sum_{{f \in f}^{\text{ptrs}}}^{}\left( \frac{Z^{'}\left( t,f \right)}{I_{\text{ptrs}}\left( t,f \right)} \right)\ \left( \widetilde{a}\left( f \right)e^{- j\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right)} \right) \right\}$$

In the above equation, $f^{\text{ptrs}}$ is the set of subcarriers where
PT-RS are mapped, ${t \in t}^{\text{ptrs}}$ where $t^{\text{ptrs}}$ is
the set of OFDM symbols where PT-RS are mapped while
$Z^{'}\left( t,f \right)$ and $I_{\text{ptrs}}\left( t,f \right)$ are is
the post-FFT acquired signal and the ideal PT-RS signal respectively.
That is, estimate of the CPE at a given OFDM symbol is obtained from
frequency correlation of the complex ratios at the PT-RS positions with
the conjugate of the estimated equalizer complex coefficients. The
estimated CPE can be subtracted from
$\overline{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to remove influence of the CPE, and
obtain estimate of the complex coefficient\'s phase

$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right) = \overline{\varphi}\left( f \right) - \widetilde{\theta}$(t)

E.7 Averaged EVM
================

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$\ N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in
a 10 ms measurement interval.

For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the $N_{\text{dl}}$ slot
duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the equalizer estimation
step.

*- Where Ni* is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

\- The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window *W* extremities of the EVM measurements:

\- Thus ![](./media/image52.wmf){width="0.7152777777777778in"

\- Thus we get:

$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$
