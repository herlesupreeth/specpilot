Foreword
========

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document is a technical report for NR Intra-band Carrier
Aggregation Rel-18 for xDL/yUL including contiguous and non-contiguous
spectrum under Rel-18 time frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant
background information and studies to address NR Intra-band Carrier
Aggregation requirements for the Rel-18 band combinations in Table 1-1,
Table 1-2, Table 1-3 and Table 1-4.

2 References {#references-1}
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations
=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in 3GPP
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any,
in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**example:** text used to clarify abstract rules by applying them
literally.

3.2 Symbols

3.3 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

4 Background
============

The present document is a technical report for NR Intra-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-18 timeframe. The document covers each band
combination specific issues (i.e. one sub-clause defined per band
combination)

4.1 TR maintenance
------------------

A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the
contact person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related
to the band combination have been implemented.

### 5.1.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for CA

As commented at RAN\#106 this type of combinations needs additional
study if any of the defined MPR and/or A-MPR needs to be updated to take
into account the additional channel bandwidth in UL. For this specific
combination NS\_58 needs to be checked.

Based on additional studies presented at RAN4\#109 it is found that no
additional A-MPR is needed for these configurations.

### 5.1.4 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence for intra-band contiguous CA

Spurious emissions requirements for UE coexistence are not applicable to
bands restricted to stand-alone operation with shared spectrum channel
access as identified in Table 5.2-1.

### 5.1.5 Reference sensitivity power level for Intra-band contiguous CA 

This update adds intra-band contiguous CA for the uplink, so no
additional impact on receiver requirements.

### 5.1.6 In-band blocking

This update adds intra-band contiguous CA for the uplink, so no
additional impact on receiver requirements.

### 5.1.7 Out-of-band blocking

This update adds intra-band contiguous CA for the uplink, so no
additional impact on receiver requirements.

### 5.1.8 Narrow band blocking

This update adds intra-band contiguous CA for the uplink, so no
additional impact on receiver requirements.

Editor\'s note (This guidance shall be omitted when drafting TPs):

In the table the following abbreviations is used:

\- fU1L = minimum frequency of TX aggressor band of ULCC1 lower band
range

\- fU2L = minimum frequency of TX aggressor band of ULCC2 lower band
range

\- fU3L = maximum frequency of TX aggressor band of ULCC2 lower band
range

\- fU1H = maximum frequency of TX aggressor band of ULCC1 higher band
range

\- fU2H = minimum frequency of TX aggressor band of ULCC2 higher band
range

\- fU3H = maximum frequency of TX aggressor band of ULCC2 higher band
range

\- fD1L = minimum frequency of RX victim band of DLCC placed on the
lower frequency side of the TX aggressor band

\- fD1H = maximum frequency of RX victim band of DLCC placed on the
lower frequency side of the TX aggressor band

\- fD2L = minimum frequency of RX victim band of DLCC placed on the
higher frequency side of the TX aggressor band

\- fD2H = maximum frequency of RX victim band of DLCC placed on the
higher frequency side of the TX aggressor band

\- Channel BW = Channel bandwidth of the component carrier. Only equal
channel BW is considered

\- Minimum channel separation = Minimum frequency separation between the
two component carriers or the inter CC GB

\- Maximum channel separation = Maximum frequency separation between the
two component carriers or aggregated uplink BW
