######### Annex \<E\>: Adjacent channel co-existence evaluation

E.1 RAN4 co-existence simulation scenarios
==========================================

The coexistence evaluation is conducted considering the different
scenarios listed in Table E.1-1.

Table E.1-1: Adjacent channel co-existence scenarios

  Scenario                                     FR      Aggressor       Victim
  -------------------------------------------- ------- --------------- ---------------
  1                                            FR1     Urban Macro     Urban Macro
  2                                            FR1     Urban Hotspot   Urban Hotspot
  3                                            FR1     Indoor          Indoor
  4                                            FR1     Urban Macro     Micro
  5                                            FR1     Micro           Micro
  6                                            FR2-1   Urban Macro     Urban Macro
  7^1^                                         FR2-1   Urban Hotspot   Urban Hotspot
  8                                            FR2-1   Urban Dense     Urban Dense
  9                                            FR2-1   Indoor          Indoor
  Note 1: Scenario 7 has been down selected.                           

The Urban Hotspot scenario reuses most parameter assumption as Urban
Macro, except that Urban Macro assumes random deployment of UEs while
Urban Hotspot assumes a clustered-based approach with different
outdoor-to-indoor UE ratios and others as described in Annex E, in Table
E.2.1-1 and Table E.2.1-2 and Table E.2.1-3.

The co-existence evaluation captures cases where TDD and SBFD are both
victim and aggressor networks. This to evaluate impact on legacy TDD
networks if SBFD is introduced in a neighbouring channel, also to
understand impact of the legacy TDD network on SBFD network, as
described in Annex E, Table E.1-2. It is worth noting that RAN4 has only
considered the case of {D, U} as an SBFD configuration as it is
comparable in terms of performance (based on RAN4 models and parameters)
to the {D, U, D} SBFD configuration.

E.2.3 BS RF characteristics
---------------------------

The SBFD BS is defined for two different antenna configurations:

\- SBFD configuration 1: The total number of antenna elements of the
antenna array for SBFD is the same as the total number of antenna
elements of the antenna array for legacy TDD.

\- SBFD configuration 2: The total number of antenna elements of the
antenna array for SBFD is two times of the total number of antenna
elements of the antenna array for legacy TDD.

As baseline the array antenna model, for single element configuration,
is described in TR 38.803, subclause 5.2.3. As an option the antenna
model extension, required for modelling sub-array configurations, is
described in TR 38.803, subclause 5.2.3.2.4.

As an option, power boosting of 3 dB can be considered to compensate for
fewer antenna elements of the array antenna in the case of SBFD
configuration 1.

Assumptions related to BS RF characteristics relevant for different
deployment scenarios are captured for FR1 in Table E.2.3-1 and for FR2-1
in Table E.2.3-2.

### E.2.3.1 BS receiver blocking model

To capture receiver blocking aspects the receiver noise figure
(*F~block~*) is characterised as a piece-wise linear function of input
receiver power (*P~in~*) as shown in Figure E.2.3.1-1.

![](./media/image6.emf){width="3.4722222222222223in"
height="2.3944444444444444in"}

Figure E.2.3.1-1: Receiver blocking model

Relevant values for *F*, *F~2~*, *P~1~* and *P~2~* for different BS
classes are listed in Table E.2.3-1 and Table E.2.3-2. If the total
received power is larger than *P~2~* the receiver will be blocked, which
corresponds to zero throughput.

The input power to the blocking model is defined as average total power
in dBm and the output is the noise figure in dB including noise rise due
to receiver blocking aspects, such as e.g., receiver intermodulation.

The receiver input total power can be expressed as a sum of wanted
signal and all interferer signals in linear scale as:

$P_{\text{in}} = P_{w} + I_{\text{intra} - \text{SB},\ \text{inter} - \text{UE}} + I_{\text{inter} - \text{SB},\text{inter} - \text{BS}} + I_{\text{ACI}} + I_{\text{self}} + I_{\text{co} - \text{site},\text{inter} - \text{sector}}$

, where the signal and interferer sources are defined as:

$$P_{\text{w\ }} = \ \frac{P_{Tx,UE}}{\text{CL}_{scheduled\ UE \rightarrow serving\ gNB}}$$

*- I~intra-SB,inter-UE~* is the interference from UEs transmitting
within the UL sub-band in the victim network. The interference level is
calculated as:

$$I_{intra - SB,inter - UE\ } = \ \frac{P_{Tx,UE}}{\text{CL}_{other\ UE \rightarrow serving\ BS}}$$

*- I~inter-SB,inter-BS~* is the interference from BS transmitting on the
adjacent DL sub-band in the victim network. The interference level is
calculated as:

$$I_{inter - SB,inter - BS} = \frac{P_{Tx,BS}}{\text{CL}_{own\ network \rightarrow serving\ BS}}$$

*- I~ACI~* is the adjacent channel interference from BS transmitting on
the DL channel in the aggressor network. The interference level is
calculated as:

$$I_{\text{ACI}} = \frac{P_{Tx,BS}}{\text{CL}_{adjacent\ network\ BS \rightarrow serving\ BS}}$$

*- I~self~* is the victim self-interference power. The interference
level is calculated as:

$$I_{\text{self}} = \frac{\text{kT}B_{\text{SB}}\text{\ F}}{M_{\text{self}}}$$

*- I~co-site,inter-sector~* is the interference from neighboring sectors
in a 3-sector configuration. The interference level is calculated as:

$$I_{co - site,inter - sector} = \frac{\text{kT}B_{\text{SB}}\text{\ F}}{M_{co - site}}$$

where the following parameters are defined:

*- P~Tx,UE~* is the configured UE transmitter power (see transmission
power control in Annex E.3.5).

*- P~Tx,BS~* is the BS transmitter power.

*- B~SB~* is the allocated UL subband bandwidth.

*- M~self~* is the noise-floor-to-self interference ratio.

*- M~co-site~* is the noise-floor-to-aggregated co-site inter sector
interference ratio.

*- kT* is the thermal noise (equal to -174 dBm/Hz in logarithmical
scale).

*- F* is the receiver noise figure.

Note that the receiver input total power does not include the ACLR and
ACS effects.

The total interference power can be expressed in linear scale as:

$$I_{\text{tot}} = I_{intra - SB,inter - UE} + \frac{I_{inter - SB,inter - BS}}{\text{ASBIR}_{inter - SB,inter - BS}} + \frac{I_{\text{ACI}}}{\text{ACIR}} + I_{\text{self}} + I_{co - site,inter - sector}$$

where additional variables are defined as:

*- ASBIR~inter-SB,inter-BS~* is the in-channel Adjacent Sub-Band
Interference Ratio, which is derived by applicable BS ACLR and BS ACS.

*- ACIR* is derived by applicable BS ACLR and BS ACS.

The SINR at the victim receiver including total noise and total
interference can be expressed in linear scale as:

$$SINR = \frac{P_{w}}{I_{\text{tot}} + kTB_{\text{SB}}F_{\text{block}}}$$

The receiver noise figure for the receiver exposed for blocking
*F~block~* is produced by the blocking model described in Figure
E.2.3.1-1.

In simulation, the UE power control scheme is only used to compensate
path loss and doesn't consider noise figure increase due to BS receiver
blocking. Therefore, the final SINR for UL is less than target SINR.

Note that additional, power scaling of all interference contributions
should be considered with respect to aggressor bandwidth and victim
bandwidth when ACIR is applied.

### E.2.3.2 BS ACLR and ACS bandwidth scaling

In RAN4, ACLR and ACS requirements are defined assuming equal bandwidth
for the aggressor's and victim's channel bandwidth. This means that the
power in the adjacent channel can be easily associated to the wanted
carrier power using ACLR and similar for ACS when receiver performance
is evaluated. However, in this adjacent channel co-existence study, the
bandwidths of aggressor and victim's networks are different. To
compensate for the difference in bandwidth, the following methodology is
adopted:

\- For cases where the aggressor's bandwidth is narrower that the
victim's bandwidth, e.g., in Case 2 in Table E.1-2:

\- Both the ACLR and ACS are kept to the values defined in Table E.2.3-1
and Table E.2.3-2.

\- For cases where the aggressor's bandwidth is wider than the victim's
bandwidth, i.e., in Case 3 in Table E.1-2:

\- A bandwidth compensation factor is applied to the ACLR and ACS values
defined in Table E.2.3-1 and Table E.2.3-2. The factor is calculated as:

$$BW_{\text{factor}} = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{BW_{\text{aggressor}}}{BW_{\text{victim}}} \right),
$$

\- For instance, for a TDD DL 100 MHz BW aggressor network interfering a
SBFD UL 20 MHz BW victim, the ACLR is equal to: 45dBc +
10log~10~(100/20) = 52 dBc

E.3 RAN4 co-existence simulation methodology
============================================

E.3.1 Coexistence evaluation methodology
----------------------------------------

The coexistence evaluation methodology can be summarized as:

1\) Aggressor and victim network are generated. UEs are distributed as
described by parameter assumptions.

2\) UEs are associated to BS based on coupling loss.

3\) Once association is done, round robin scheduling is used. BF weights
are adjusted to point to the LOS direction between BS and UE. This is
done for both victim and aggressor networks.

4\) Throughput is computed in the victim systems without considering
Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) as:

> Thput~No\_ACI~\[bit/s/Hz\]=f(SINR~ICI~)=f(S/(N+I~ICI~)), where I~ICI~
> is the intra-network co-channel inter-cell interference.
>
> 5\) Throughput is computed in the victim systems considering ACI from
> the baseline aggressor (see Table E.1-2) as:
>
> Thput~ACI\_baseline~\[bit/s/Hz\]=f(SINR~ICI+ACI\_baseline~)=f(S/(N+I~ICI~+I~ACI\_baseline~)),
> where I~ACI\_baseline~ is the adjacent channel interference due to the
> baseline aggressor network.
>
> 6\) Throughput is computed in the victim systems considering ACI from
> the aggressor (see Table E.1-2) as:
>
> Thput~ACI~\[bit/s/Hz\]=f(SINR~ICI+ACI~)=f(S/(N+I~ICI~+I~ACI~)), where
> I~ACI~ is the adjacent channel interference due to the aggressor
> network.
>
> 7\) The ratio between the throughput degradation due to the presence
> of baseline aggressor and aggressor network is used to derive the
> coexistence conclusions and it is determined as:
>
> Loss~final~=1-Thput~ACI~/Thput~ACI\_baseline~
>
> Note: For Case 3 and Case 4, the baseline aggressor is "No aggressor
> network" and therefore Thput~ACI\_baseline~ = Thput~No\_ACI~

The simulation results should be in the form of the throughput
degradation with adjacent network baseline and with adjacent network and
the ratio between the two can be compared at average and cell edge
performance.

The throughput of a modem with link adaptation can be approximated by an
attenuated and truncated form of the Shannon bound. (The Shannon bound
represents the maximum theoretical throughput than can be achieved over
an AWGN channel for a given SNIR). The following equations approximate
the throughput (*T~p~*) in bps/Hz over a channel with a given *SNIR*,
when using link adaptation:

$$T_{p} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
0 \\
 \propto S\left( \text{SNIR} \right) \\
 \propto S\left( \text{SNIR}_{\text{MAX}} \right) \\
\end{matrix}\begin{matrix}
for\ SNIR \leq \text{SNIR}_{\text{MIN}} \\
\text{\ for\ }\text{SNIR}_{\text{MIN}} \leq SNIR < \text{SNIR}_{\text{MAX}} \\
for\ SNIR \geq \text{SNIR}_{\text{MAX}} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $$

Where:

  *S(SNIR)*     Shannon bound, *S(SNIR) =log~2~(1+SNIR)* bps/Hz

  *α*           Attenuation factor, representing implementation losses
  *SNIR~MIN~*   Minimum SNIR of the code set, dB
  *SNIR~MAX~*   Maximum SNIR of the code set, dB

The parameters can be chosen to represent different modem
implementations and link conditions. A parameter set relevant for eMBB
is listed in Table E.3.1-1.

E.3.2 Received signal power model
---------------------------------

The following model is applied:

$Rx_{\text{PWR}} = Tx_{\text{PWR}} - PL + G_{\text{Tx}} + G_{\text{Rx}}$

where the following parameters are defined:

\- $Rx_{\text{PWR}}$ is the received power.

\- $Tx_{\text{PWR}}$ is the transmitted power.

\- $G_{\text{Tx}}$ is the transmitter antenna gain (directional array
gain).

\- $G_{\text{Rx}}$ is the receiver antenna gain (directional array
gain).

E.3.3 Network grid shift
------------------------

In cases with grid shift \>0%, the victim network base stations should
be placed as shown in Figure E.3.3-1. The victim network grid is shifted
along the line between BS and its closest 100% grid-shift BS, where the
distance from any BS in victim network to its second and third closest
BS in the aggressor network is the same.

Figure E.3.3-1: Network grid shift definition

E.3.4 Coupling-loss
-------------------

The Coupling Loss (CL) is defined as the loss in signal between
BS-to-UE, UE-to-UE and BS-to-BS. CL is defined as the loss including
propagation loss and antenna gains with BF weights applied measured
between antenna connectors.

E.3.5 Transmission power control
--------------------------------

For downlink scenario, no power control scheme is applied.

For uplink scenario, TPC model specified in TR 36.942, subclause 9.1 is
applied with following parameters.

\- CLx-ile = --SNR\_target + UE\_max\_eirp-- ThermalNoise --
BS\_NoiseFigure - 10\*log10(BW)

\- γ = 1

Where, SNR\_target for FR1 and FR2-1 is 15 dB.

In simulation, power control scheme is only used to compensate path
loss. That's the reason why final SINR for UL is less than assumed
target SINR. But commercial UE UL SINR could meet target value according
to power control scheme in TS 38.213.

E.4 Differences in simulation assumptions of RAN1 and RAN4
==========================================================

E.4.1 Simulation objectives in RAN1 and RAN4
--------------------------------------------

RAN4 simulations are focused on coexistence analysis between two
networks operating on adjacent channels. Specifically, RAN4 evaluated
the impact of a SBFD network towards a (legacy) TDD network and vice
versa. The RAN4 coexistence evaluation is conducted considering the
different scenarios and cases listed in Annex E.1 in Table E.1-1 and
Table E.1-2, respectively.

RAN1 conducted the SBFD performance assessment with the main purpose of
understanding SBFD performance benefits over legacy static TDD, as well
as to investigate the potential of different techniques to combat the
cross-link interference present in SBFD. Four deployment cases are
considered for evaluation in RAN1, as described in Clause 7.1.

E.4.2 Simulation methodology in RAN1 and RAN4
---------------------------------------------

Typically, RAN4 simulations consists of multiple drops (with different
UE positions, etc.) where each drop represents a 'snapshot' of the
network at a particular time. For each drop, RAN4 simulation methodology
is outlined in Section E.3.1. Note that RAN4 simulations are fully
static (i.e., no time-variant processes, such as fast fading or UE
movement, are modelled) so the obtained SINR and throughput statistics
intend to capture long-term averaged SINR and throughput performance of
the corresponding user. The reported throughput represents the upper
bound based on the Shannon capacity. Additionally, RAN4 considers full
buffer assumptions with no HARQ or dynamic link adaptation as typically
RAN4 is studying coexistence from RF emissions point of view.

On the other hand, RAN1 system level simulations are generally
time-driven simulations which try to capture most of the system
dynamics. This includes dynamic traffic models resulting in time-varying
load and interference conditions, as well as several radio resource
management (RRM) functionalities such as CSI acquisition, HARQ
retransmissions, packet scheduler, MIMO (including beamforming and
precoding techniques) and link adaptation. For each simulated link, a
stochastic 3D channel model is used to generate fast-fading components
taking into account the angular and delay spreads of the channel, as
specified in TR 38.901. Given the dynamicity of the underlying system
model, throughput and SINR vary over time for each simulated user.

E4.3 System level differences between RAN1 and RAN4
---------------------------------------------------

This section highlights some differences between the SBFD system level
simulations performed in RAN1 and RAN4. A table is presented in Table
E.4.3-1 lists a highlight of such differences, while using FR1 Urban
Macro scenario as an example. It's worth noting that there are other
differences in simulation methodologies and assumptions due to the
different objectives and mechanisms considered by two separated groups
as highlighted in the above. For the interested reader, the detailed
assumptions along with the different methodologies can be found in Annex
E for RAN4 and in Annex A and B for RAN1 simulations.

E.4.4 Modelling of adjacent-channel interference in RAN1 and RAN4
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In RAN4, the SINR is calculated based on the power of wanted and
interference signals, and noise. The signal power of each link is based
on the transmission power and the corresponding coupling loss (CL) of
the link. The CL is defined in Annex E.3.4 as the loss including
propagation loss and antenna gains with BF weights applied measured
between antenna connectors. As baseline assumption, the beamforming
model in TR 38.803 clause 5.2.3.1 is used which assumes that there is
one beam formed to the scheduled user using all the antenna elements.

In contrast, for inter-site BS-BS adjacent channel interference
modelling in RAN1 (Annex A.2.6), the CL is measured on each individual
Tx-Rx antenna port using equation (A-16) and then averaged across all
Tx-Rx antenna port combinations.
