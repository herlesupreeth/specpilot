10 Measurement Performance requirements
=======================================

10.1 NR measurements
--------------------

### 10.1.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1 apply as follows:

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for PCell measurements in SA,
NR-DC, or NE-DC operation mode,

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for PSCell measurements in NR-DC
or EN-DC operation mode,

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for SCell measurements in SA
operation mode with NR CA or any MR-DC operation mode with NR CA,

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for non-serving cell measurements
on NR carrier frequencies.

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for measurements from one cell on
a frequency compared to the measurement from another cell on a different
frequency.

In the requirements of clause 10.1, the exceptions for side conditions
apply as follows:

\- for the UE capable of CA but not configured with any SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in annex B,
clause B.3.2.1 for UE supporting CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.3 for UE
supporting CA in FR2, respectively;

\- for the UE capable of CA and configured with at least one SCell, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in Annex B,
clause B.3.2.2 for UE configured with CA in FR1, and clause B.3.2.4 for
UE supporting CA in FR2, respectively;

\- for the UE capable of SUL but not configured with SUL, the applicable
exceptions for side conditions are specified in annex B, clause B.3.4.1
for UE supporting SUL in FR1;

\- for the UE capable of SUL and configured with at least one SUL, the
applicable exceptions for side conditions are specified in annex B,
clause B.3.4.2 for UE configured with SUL in FR1.

### 10.1.2 Intra-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR1

#### 10.1.2.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.2.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the accuracy requirements for absolute
SS-RSRP in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR1. The accuracy requirements in this clause are
also applicable when *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* or
*highSpeedMeasCA-Scell-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.2.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1.2.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative SS-RSRP accuracy is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the SS-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
in FR1. The accuracy requirements in this clause are also applicable
when *highSpeedMeasFlag-r16* or *highSpeedMeasCA-Scell-r17* is
configured.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.2.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

#### 10.1.2.2 Void

#### 10.1.2.3 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.2.3.1 Absolute CSI-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RSRP
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell where the CSI-RS resources to be
measured have the same center frequency as the CSI-RS resources
indicated for measurement in the serving cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.2.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.2.3.1-1.- The timing offset
between the reference measurement timing and the target CSI-RS in one
layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

##### 10.1.2.3.2 Relative CSI-RSRP Accuracy

The relative CSI-RSRP accuracy is defined as the CSI-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRP levels measured on the
same cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.2.3.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.2.3.2-1. - The timing offset
between the reference measurement timing and the target CSI-RS in one
layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

### 10.1.3 Intra-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR2

#### 10.1.3.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.3.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute SS-RSRP
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.3.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of
TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.3.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative SS-RSRP accuracy is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the SS-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
in FR2.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.3.2 Void

#### 10.1.3.3 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.3.3.1 Absolute CSI-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RSRP
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell where the CSI-RS resources to be
measured have the same center frequency as the CSI-RS resources
indicated for measurement in the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.3.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB(s).

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.3.3.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of
TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.3.3.2 Relative CSI-RSRP Accuracy

The relative CSI-RSRP accuracy is defined as the CSI-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRP levels measured on the
same cell in FR2.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each associated SSB(s).

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each CSI-RS to be measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.3.3.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

### 10.1.3C Intra-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR2-NTN

#### 10.1.3C.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.3C.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute SS-RSRP
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2-NTN.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.3C.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 10.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.17 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

##### 10.1.3C.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative SS-RSRP accuracy is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell compared to the SS-RSRP measured from another cell on the same
frequency, or between any two SS-RSRP levels measured on the same cell
in FR2-NTN.

\- Conditions defined in clause 10.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.17 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

##### 10.1.4.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy in FR1

The requirements for absolute SS-RSRP accuracy in this clause apply to a
cell on a frequency in FR1 that has different carrier frequency from the
serving cell. The accuracy requirements in this clause are also
applicable when *highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.4.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1.4.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy in FR1

The relative SS-RSRP accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1compared to the RSRP
measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1. The accuracy
requirements in this clause are also applicable when
*highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.4.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] Clause 7.3 for
reference sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to Annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

#### 10.1.4.2 Void

#### 10.1.4.3 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.4.3.1 Absolute CSI-RSRP Accuracy in FR1

The requirements for absolute CSI-RSRP accuracy in this clause apply to
a cell where the CSI-RS resources to be measured have the different
center frequency as the CSI-RS resources indicated for measurement in
the serving cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.4.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.4.3.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.4.3.2 Relative CSI-RSRP Accuracy in FR1

The relative CSI-RSRP accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
CSI-RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1compared to the
CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.4.3.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] clause 7.3 for
reference sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.4.3.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

• NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for
inter-frequency measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be
based on the timing of one of the target cells.

\- \|CSI\_RP1~dBm~ - CSI\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

##### 10.1.5.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative SS-RSRP accuracy is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the SS-RSRP measured from
another cell on another frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.5.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in TS 38.101-2 \[19\] clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\-- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.5.2 Void

#### 10.1.5.3 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.5.3.1 Absolute CSI-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RSRP
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell on a frequency in FR2 where the
CSI-RS resources to be measured have the different center frequency as
the CSI-RS resources indicated for measurement in the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.5.3.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant associated
SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.5.3.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

##### 10.1.5.3.2 Relative CSI-RSRP Accuracy

The relative CSI-RSRP accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
CSI-RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the
CSI-RSRP measured from another cell on another frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.5.3.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in TS 38.101-2 \[19\] clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant associated
SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS to be
measured.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3. The
performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better than
the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.5.3.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

\- \|CSI\_RP1~dBm~ - CSI\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

### 10.1.5C Inter-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR2-NTN

#### 10.1.5C.1 Inter-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.5C.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute SS-RSRP
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell on a frequency in FR2-NTN that
is on a different frequency than the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.5C.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 10.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

##### 10.1.5C.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative SS-RSRP accuracy is defined as the SS-RSRP measured from
one cell on a frequency in FR2-NTN compared to the SS-RSRP measured from
another cell on another frequency in FR2-NTN.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.5C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-5 \[19\] clause 10.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

### 10.1.6 RSRP Measurement Report Mapping

The reporting range of SS-RSRP and CSI-RSRP for L3 reporting is defined
from -156 dBm to -31 dBm with 1 dB resolution. The reporting range of
SS-RSRP and CSI-RSRP for L1 reporting is defined from -140 to -44 dBm
with 1 dB resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in table 10.1.6.1-1. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

The reporting range of differential SS-RSRP and CSI-RSRP for L1
reporting is defined from 0 dB to -30 dB with 2 dB resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in table 10.1.6.1-2. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

#### 10.1.7.2 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.7.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RSRQ
accuracy in this clause apply to the intra-frequency measurement defined
in clause 9.10.2.1 in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.7.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for associated SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.7.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

#### 10.1.8.2 Intra-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.8.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RSRQ
accuracy in this clause apply to the intra-frequency measurement defined
in clause 9.10.2.1 in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.8.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.8.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for intra-frequency
measurement is serving cell timing.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of
TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.9.1.2 Relative SS-RSRQ Accuracy in FR1

The relative SS-RSRQ accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the RSRP
measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1. The accuracy
requirements in this clause are also applicable when
*highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17* is configured.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.9.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

#### 10.1.9.2 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.9.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RSRQ
accuracy in this clause apply to the inter-frequency measurement defined
in clause 9.10.3.1 in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.9.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

> • The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or
> better than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.9.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.9.2.2 Relative CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

The relative CSI-RSRQ accuracy is defined as the CSI-RSRQ measured from
one cell compared to the CSI-RSRQ measured from another cell with the
same center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRQ levels measured on
the same cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.9.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for the associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.9.2.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.9C.1.2 Relative SS-RSRQ Accuracy in FR1

The relative SS-RSRQ accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the RSRP
measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.9C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[43\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB
>
> \- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

#### 10.1.10.1 Inter-frequency SS-RSRQ accuracy requirements in FR2

##### 10.1.10.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRQ Accuracy in FR2

The requirements for absolute SS-RSRQ accuracy in this clause apply to a
cell on a frequency in FR2 that has different carrier frequency from the
serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
> to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.
>
> \- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the
> percentile EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4
> of TS 38.101-2 \[19\].

##### 10.1.10.1.2 Relative SS-RSRQ Accuracy in FR2

The relative SS-RSRQ accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the RSRP
measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1 dB~m~ - SSB\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.10.2 Inter-frequency CSI-RSRQ accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.10.2.1 Absolute CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RSRQ
accuracy in this clause apply the inter-frequency measurement defined in
clause 9.10.3.1 in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

> • The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or
> better than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10.2.1-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

##### 10.1.10.2.2 Relative CSI-RSRQ Accuracy

The relative CSI-RSRQ accuracy is defined as the CSI-RSRQ measured from
one cell compared to the CSI-RSRQ measured from another cell with the
same center frequency, or between any two CSI-RSRQ levels measured on
the same cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band for the associated SSB.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10.2.2-1.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for one layer for inter-frequency
measurement is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing
of one of the target cells.

### 10.1.10B Inter-frequency RSRQ accuracy requirements for FR2 for CA/DC Idle Mode Measurements

#### 10.1.10B.1 Inter-frequency SS-RSRQ accuracy requirements in FR2

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a UE:

\- in state RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE

\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.

The requirements are for absolute SS-RSRQ accuracy.

##### 10.1.10B.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRQ Accuracy in FR2

The requirements for absolute SS-RSRQ accuracy in this clause apply to a
cell on a frequency in FR2 that has different carrier frequency from the
serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10B.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.1.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

##### 10.1.10C.1.2 Relative SS-RSRQ Accuracy in FR2-NTN

The relative SS-RSRQ accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2-NTN compared to the
RSRP measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2-NTN.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.10C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 10.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1 dB~m~ - SSB\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

#### 10.1.12.2 Intra-frequency CSI-SINR accuracy requirements in FR1

##### 10.1.12.2.1 Absolute CSI-SINR Accuracy in FR1

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-SINR
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.12.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

• NOTE: The reference measurement timing for intra-frequency measurement
is serving cell timing.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.12.2.1-1.

#### 10.1.13.2 Intra-frequency CSI-SINR accuracy requirements in FR2

##### 10.1.13.2.1 Absolute CSI-SINR Accuracy in FR2

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-SINR
accuracy in this clause apply to a cell on the same frequency as that of
the serving cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.13.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.8 for a corresponding Band.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

• NOTE: The reference measurement timing for intra-frequency measurement
is serving cell timing.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.13.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.14.1.2 Relative SS-SINR Accuracy in FR1

The relative SS-SINR accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.14.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band.

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency measurement
is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing of one of
the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.14.2.2 Relative CSI-SINR Accuracy in FR1

The relative CSI-SINR accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
CSI-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
CSI-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.14.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band.

\- \|CSI\_RP1~dBm~ - CSI\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

NOTE: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency measurement
is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing of one of
the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

> \- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or
> better than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.14.2.2-1.

##### 10.1.14C.1.2 Relative SS-SINR Accuracy in FR1

The relative SS-SINR accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR1 compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.14C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[43\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.18 for a corresponding Band.

\- \|SSB\_RP1~dBm~ - SSB\_RP2~dBm~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

##### 10.1.15.1.2 Relative SS-SINR Accuracy in FR2

The relative SS-SINR accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the
SS-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.15.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.3 for a corresponding Band.

\- \|SSB\_RP1 dB~m~ - SSB\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.15.2 Inter-frequency CSI-SINR accuracy requirements in FR2

##### 10.1.15.2.1 Absolute CSI-SINR Accuracy in FR2

The requirements for absolute CSI-SINR accuracy in this clause apply to
a cell on a frequency in FR2 that has different carrier frequency from
the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.15.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

• NOTE: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency measurement
is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing of one of
the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

• The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.15.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.15.2.2 Relative CSI-SINR Accuracy in FR2

The relative CSI-SINR accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
CSI-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency in FR2 compared to the
CSI-SINR measured from another cell on a different frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.15.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.y for a corresponding Band.

\- \|CSI\_RP1 dB~m~ - CSI\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \| Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- The timing offset between the reference measurement timing and the
target CSI-RS in one layer is no larger than CP.

Note: The reference measurement timing for inter-frequency measurement
is up to UE implementation and shall be based on the timing of one of
the target cells.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.15.2.2-1.

### 10.1.16 SINR report mapping

#### 10.1.16.1 SS-SINR and CSI-SINR measurement report mapping

The reporting range of SS-SINR and CSI-SINR for L3 reporting and L1
reporing is defined from -23 dB to 40 dB with 0.5 dB resolution. The
mapping of measured quantity is defined in table 10.1.16.1-1. The range
in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range.

The reporting range of differential SS-SINR and CSI-SINR for L1
reporting is defined from -15 dB to 0 dB with 1 dB resolution.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in table 10.1.16.1-2. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

##### 10.1.19.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the cell (serving cell or cell with different PCI from
serving cell) on which UE performs L1-RSRP measurements.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

#### 10.1.19.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.19.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RS based
L1-RSRP accuracy in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.19.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19.2.2-1.

##### 10.1.19C.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19C.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.19.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- Valid information for the SAN serving the target cell has been
provided.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19C.2.2-1.

##### 10.1.19D.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured on one SSB configured in *LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* compared to
the L1-RSRP measured on another SSB configured in
*LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* for the cell(s) on the same frequency in
FR1.The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.19D.1.2-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

##### 10.1.19E.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured on one SSB configured in *LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* from one cell
on a frequency in FR1 compared to another SSB configured in
*LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* from any other cell on another frequency in
FR1.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.19E.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1 dB~m~ - SSB\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

##### 10.1.20.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the cell (serving cell or cell with different PCI from
serving cell) on which UE performs L1-RSRP measurements.

When the UE is configured with *groupBasedBeamReporting-r17* set to
\'enabled\', the relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the
L1-RSRP measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all SSBs of the serving cell on which UE performs L1-RSRP
measurements with different Rx beams, the all SSBs are in the same or
different resource set (s) in one CSI resource setting.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

#### 10.1.20.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.20.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RS based
L1-RSRP accuracy in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement, and all the CSI-RSs of
the serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement when the UE is
configured with *groupBasedBeamReporting-r17* set to \'enabled\'.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.20.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RSs of the cell (serving cell or cell with
different PCI from serving cell) on which UE performs L1-RSRP
measurements.

For simultaneous reception from multiple directions, when the UE is
configured with *groupBasedBeamReporting-r17* set to \'enabled\', the
relative CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RSs of the serving cell on which UE performs
L1-RSRP measurements with different Rx beams, the all CSI-RSs are in the
same or different resource set (s) in one CSI resource setting. RSRP
among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20.2.2-1.

### 10.1.20A LTM Intra-frequency L1-RSRP accuracy requirements for FR2

#### 10.1.20A.1 SSB based intra-frequency L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.20A.1.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
SSB based intra-frequency L1-RSRP in this clause apply to all SSBs of
candidate neighbour cell(s) on the same frequency as that of the serving
cell in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20A.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

##### 10.1.20A.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured on one SSB configured in *LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* compared to
the L1-RSRP measured from another SSB configured in
*LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* from the cell(s) on the same frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20A.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

##### 10.1.20B.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured on one SSB configured in *LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* on one cell
on a frequency in FR2 compared to the value of L1-RSRP measured from
another SSB configured in *LTM-CSI-ResourceConfig* from any other cell
on another frequency in FR2.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.20B.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1 dB~m~ - SSB\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

##### 10.1.20C.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of SSB based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the serving cell on which UE performs L1-RSRP
measurements.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20C.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 10.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.19 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

#### 10.1.20C.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1.20C.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute accuracy of
CSI-RS based L1-RSRP in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources of the
serving cell configured for L1-RSRP measurement.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20C.2.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 10.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.19 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20C.2.1-1.

##### 10.1.20C.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative accuracy of CSI-RS based L1-RSRP is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-RSRP among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20C.2.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 10.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[42\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to Annex
B.2.19 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The measured signals are in the directions within the declared
minimum elevation angle supported for receiving.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in Table 10.1.20C.2.2-1.

### 10.1.22 CLI measurement accuracy requirements

#### 10.1.22.1 SRS-RSRP

##### 10.1.22.1.1 SRS-RSRP Accuracy

The SRS-RSRP measurement reported by the UE shall fulfil the accuracy
requirements defined in table 10.1.22.1.1-1 for FR1 and table
10.1.22.1.1-2 for FR2, provided that the following conditions are met.
The accuracy requirements in this clause are derived based on AWGN radio
propagation conditions.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for SRS-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.z for a corresponding Band for each relevant SRS resource configured
for measurement.

\- The time difference between UE's DL reference timing in the serving
cell and SRS arrival time is no larger than T~error\_SRS\_RSRP~, where

\- T~error\_SRS\_RSRP~ = T~C~ × N~TA\_offset~ + 4.67µs for FR1

\- T~error\_SRS\_RSRP~ = T~C~ × N~TA\_offset~ + 3.67µs for FR2

\- N~TA\_offset~ is defined in table 7.1.2-2

\- T~C~ is 0.509 ns

\- The number of SRS ports in the SRS resource configured for
measurement is 1,

\- The number of symbols in the SRS resource configured for measurement
is 1,

\- The number of repetitions in the SRS resource configured for
measurement is 1,

\- Frequency hopping, sequence group hopping or sequence hopping is
disabled in the SRS resource configured for measurement,

\- The bandwidth of the SRS resource is 48 PRBs.

\- One of the following conditions is met

\- There is no other SRS resource with the same root sequence and on the
same symbol and with same comb as the relevant SRS resource.

\- If multiple SRS resources are on the same symbol and with same comb,
the distance between cyclic shifts of any two resources is no less than
6 if transmissionComb = n4, and no less than 4 if transmissionComb = n2.

##### 10.1.22.2.2 CLI-RSSI report mapping

The reporting range of CLI-RSSI is defined from -100 dBm to -25 dBm with
1 dB resolution. The mapping of measured quantity is defined in table
10.1.22.2.2-1. The range in the signalling may be larger than the
guaranteed accuracy range. UE shall scale the measured CLI-RSSI to
report a nominal RSSI equivalent to 6RB measurement with 15 kHz SCS.

### 10.1.23 RSTD Measurements

#### 10.1.23.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.23 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more DL RSTD measurements
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in clause 10.1.23 shall
apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG or without MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

\- when UE is in RRC\_IDLE state.

#### 10.1.23.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The accuracy requirements for RSTD measurement shall be within
±(X+Y+Z+Δ) T~c~.

X is defined in table 10.1.23.2-1 for AWGN channel and table 10.1.23.2-3
for fading channel for FR1, provided that the following conditions are
met.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE does not perform positioning measurement with reduced number of
samples.

X is defined in table 10.1.23.2-2 for AWGN channel and table 10.1.23.2-4
for fading channel for FR2, provided that the following conditions are
met.

> \- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for
> reference sensitivity are fulfilled.
>
> \- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
> B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
> configured for measurement.
>
> \- UE does not perform positioning measurement with reduced number of
> samples.

X is defined in table 10.1.23.2-7 for AWGN channel in FR1 provided that
the following conditions are met.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE supports positioning measurement with reduced number of sample and
is indicated by LMF to perform positioning measurement with reduced
number of samples.

X is defined in table 10.1.23.2-8 for AWGN channel in FR2 provided that
the following conditions are met.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE supports positioning measurement with reduced number of sample and
is indicated by LMF to perform positioning measurement with reduced
number of samples.

NOTE: The requirements for fading channel in this clause are derived
based on TDL-A (30 ns delay spread, 5 Hz) and TDL-C (60 ns delay spread,
300 Hz) channel models for FR1 and FR2 respectively.

When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging to different PFLs, then
the RSTD accuracy is defined as the accuracy corresponding to the
largest accuracy value among different PFLs.

If the UE doesn't support Rx TEG reporting for RSTD measurement or when
the measurements of reference cell and **neighbour cell belong to
different Rx TEGs, Y, Z and** Δ **are defined as follows:**

\- When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging to same PFL, Y=32
Tc, provided that the time offset between the two PRS resource instances
from the reference cell and the neighbor cell, which are used for a
single RSTD estimate, is no greater than 160 ms.

\- When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging different PFLs,
Y=256 Tc, provided that the time offset between the two PRS resource
instances from the reference cell and the neighbor cell, which are used
for a single RSTD estimate, is no greater than 1280 ms.

\- Z is defined in table 10.1.23.2-5 for FR1 and table 10.1.23.2-6 for
FR2, respectively.

\- Δ is zero for single PFL, and is defined in table 10.1.23.2-5a for
FR1 and table 10.1.23.2-6a for FR2, respectively, for dual PFL.

If the measurements of reference cell and **neighbour cell belong to the
same Rx TEG, i.e. associated and reported with a common Rx TEG ID, then
the sum of Y+Z+**Δ **is equal to the timing error margin of the Rx TEG
reported in *nr-UE-RxTEG-TimingErrorMargin*. The timing error margin
reported via *nr-UE-RxTEG-TimingErrorMargin* cannot be larger than the
value of (Y+Z****+**Δ**) defined when** the UE does not associate the
measurements with the same Rx TEG**.**

##### 10.1.23.3.2 Differential Reporting for DL RSTD Measurement

A first DL RSTD measurement is reported by means of differential
reporting, i.e. as ∆RSTD, relative to a second DL RSTD measurement
(RSTD2), provided that:

\- the absolute measured quantity value of the second DL RSTD
measurement (RSTD2) is not larger than the absolute measured quantity
value of the first DL RSTD measurement (RSTD1), i.e.,
∆RSTD=RSTD1-RSTD2≥0, and

\- the absolute value of the second DL RSTD measurement (RSTD2) is
reported together with ∆RSTD for the first DL RSTD measurement.

The reporting range for differential reporting ∆RSTD of the first DL
RSTD measurement is defined from 0 up to 8191×T~c~ with the resolution
step of 2*^k^*×T~c~, where

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min\ ~*= -6 and *k~max\ ~*= 5,

*k≥* *timingReportingGranularityFactor* \[34\] configured by LMF via LPP
for the RSTD measurement.

The measurement report mapping for different *k* values are specified in
tables 10.1.23.3.2-1 − 10.1.23.3.2-12.

##### 10.1.23.3.3 Additional Path Report Mapping for DL RSTD

The reporting range for the additional path reporting for an RSTD
measurement is defined up to the range from -8175×T~c~ to 8175×T~c~ with
the resolution step of 2*^k^*×T~c~, where

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min\ ~*= -6 and *k~max~* = 5,

*k≥* *timingReportingGranularityFactor* \[34\] configured by LMF via LPP
for the RSTD measurement.

The UE can report the timing of up to two additional paths with respect
to the path timing determining the RSTD measurement.

A UE capable of *additionalPathsExtSupport-r17* can report the timing
for a number additional paths, up to its capability, with respect to the
path timing determining the RSTD measurement.

The report mappings for different *k* values are specified in tables
10.1.23.3.3-1 − 10.1.23.3.3-12.

### 10.1.23A RSTD Measurements Based on PRS Aggregation

#### 10.1.23A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.23A shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message with
*nr-DL-PRS-JointMeasurementRequestedPFL-List* from LMF via LPP TS 37.355
\[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more DL RSTD measurements
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] with aggregated measurement. The requirements
in clause 10.1.23A shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG or without MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state,

\- when UE is in RRC\_IDLE state.

10.1.23A.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging to different PFLs or
different PFL combinations, then the RSTD accuracy is defined as the
accuracy corresponding to the largest accuracy value among different
PFLs or different PFL combinations.

The requirements in this clause for 3-PFL and 2-PFL apply provided that:

\- PRS resources linked for aggregation saftisfy all the conditions
specified in TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.6.5.3.

\- The spacing between the center frequencies of adjacent PFLs
containing PRS resources linked for aggregation does not exceed the
nominal channel spacing for intra-band contiguous CA defined in TS
38.101-1 \[18\], clause 5.4A.1 for FR1, and in TS 38.101-2, \[19\]
clause 5.4A.1 for FR2-1.

The accuracy requirements for RSTD measurement based on PRS Aggregation
shall be within ±(X+Y+Z+Δ) T~c~.

X is defined in table 10.1.23A.2-1 for AWGN channel and table
10.1.23A.2-3 for fading channel for FR1, provided that the following
conditions are met:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE does not perform positioning measurement with reduced number of
samples.

X is defined in table 10.1.23A.2-2 for AWGN channel and table
10.1.23A.2-4 for fading channel for FR2, provided that the following
conditions are met:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE does not perform positioning measurement with reduced number of
samples.

X is defined in table 10.1.23A.2-5 for AWGN channel in FR1, provided
that the following conditions are met:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE supports positioning measurement with reduced number of sample and
is indicated by LMF to perform positioning measurement with reduced
number of samples.

X is defined in table 10.1.23A.2-6 for AWGN channel in FR2, provided
that the following conditions are met:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- UE supports positioning measurement with reduced number of sample and
is indicated by LMF to perform positioning measurement with reduced
number of samples.

NOTE: The requriements for fading channel in this clause are derived
based on TDL-A (30 ns delay spread, 5Hz) and TDL-C (60 ns delay spread,
300 Hz) channel models for FR1 and FR2 respectively.

If the UE doesn't support Rx TEG reporting for RSTD measurement or when
the measurements of reference cell and **neighbour cell belong to
different Rx TEGs, Y, Z and** Δ **are defined as follows:**

\- When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging to same PFL or same
PFL combination, Y=32 Tc, provided that the time offset between the two
PRS resource instances from the reference cell and the neighbor cell,
which are used for a single RSTD estimate, is no greater than 160 ms.

\- When UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging different PFLs or
different PFL combinations, Y=256 Tc, provided that the time offset
between the two PRS resource instances from the reference cell and the
neighbor cell, which are used for a single RSTD estimate, is no greater
than 1280 ms.

\- Z is defined in table 10.1.23A.2-7 for FR1 and table 10.1.23A.2-9 for
FR2, respectively, where the PRS BW refers to the sum of the PRS PRB
numbers across the aggregated PFLs.

\- Δ is zero when UE measures RSTD on PRS resources belonging to same
PFL or same PFL combination and is defined in table 10.1.23A.2-8 for FR1
and table 10.1.23A.2-10 for FR2, respectively, when UE measures RSTD on
PRS resources belonging different PFLs or different PFL combinations,
where the PRS BW refers to the sum of the PRS PRB numbers across the
aggregated PFLs.

If the measurements of reference cell and **neighbour cell belong to the
same Rx TEG, i.e. associated and reported with a common Rx TEG ID, then
the sum of Y+Z+**Δ **is equal to the timing error margin of the Rx TEG
reported in *nr-UE-RxTEG-TimingErrorMargin*. The timing error margin
reported via *nr-UE-RxTEG-TimingErrorMargin* cannot be larger than the
value of (Y+Z+**Δ**) defined when** the UE does not associate the
measurements with the same Rx TEG**.**

##### 10.1.24.2.2 Relative PRS RSRP accuracy

The relative PRS-RSRP accuracy is defined as accuracy of the difference
between two PRS-RSRP measurements.

The relative PRS-RSRP accuracy requirements apply for the cases when
PRS-RSRP is measured from PRS resources in the same PRS resource set in
FR1 or FR2, and measured with same Rx beam in case of FR2.

The accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRP measurement for FR1 defined in
table 10.1.24.2.2-1 are valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-1 clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity
are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

\- UE does not support positioning measurements with reduced number of
samples, or LMF does not indicate UE to perform positioning measurements
with reduced number of samples

The accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRP measurement for FR2 defined in
table 10.1.24.2.2-2 are valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-2 clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity
are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

\- UE does not support positioning measurements with reduced number of
samples, or LMF does not indicate UE to perform positioning measurements
with reduced number of samples

##### 10.1.24.3.2 Differential Report Mapping for PRS-RSRP Measurement

The reporting range of differential PRS-RSRP is defined from -30 dB to 0
dB with 1 dB resolution when *nr-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation*
message is received.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in table 10.1.24.3.2-1. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy
range.

The reporting range of differential PRS-RSRP is defined from -30 dB to
30 dB with 1 dB resolution when *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation*
or *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation is received*.

The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 10.1.24.3.2-2. The
range in the signalling may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range
or the range supported by the UE receiver for differential RSRP measured
on different PRS resources in frequency domain at the same time.

### 10.1.24A PRS-RSRP Measurements Based on PRS Aggregation

#### 10.1.24A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.24A shall apply, provided that the UE
has received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* or
*nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP TS
37.355 \[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more DL PRS-RSRP
measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\] performed *by aggregating PRS
resources from multiple PFLs* via *nr-DL-PRS-JointMeasurementRequested
TS 37.355 \[34\]*.

The requirements in clause 10.1.24A shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state,

\- when UE is in RRC\_IDLE state.

#### 10.1.24A.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

##### 10.1.24A.2.1 Absolute PRS RSRP Accuracy Requirement

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.24.2.1 corresponding to the
total aggregated PRS bandwidth shall apply.

##### 10.1.24A.2.2 Relative PRS RSRP Accuracy Requirement

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.24.2.2 corresponding to the
total aggregated PRS bandwidth shall apply.

#### 10.1.24A.3 Report Mapping

##### 10.1.24A.3.1 Absolute PRS-RSRP Measurement Report Mapping 

The absolute report mapping for PRS-RSRP measurement in clause
10.1.24.3.1 shall apply.

##### 10.1.24A.3.2 Differential Report Mapping for PRS-RSRP Measurement

The differential report mapping for PRS-RSRP measurement in clause
10.1.24.3.2 shall apply.

### 10.1.25 UE Rx-Tx Time Difference Measurements

#### 10.1.25.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.25 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[31\] requesting the UE to report one or more UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in
clause 10.1.25 shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG or without MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

#### 10.1.25.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

> N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
> measurement period or
>
> if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
> measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within -160, 160 msec of at least one DL PRS
resource of each of the TRPs in the assistance data.

If the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the autonomous timing adjustment defined in
clause 7.1.2 then:

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall apply for a cell,
which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for
SRS transmission even if the uplink transmission timing changes during
the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall not apply for a
cell, which is not the downlink reference cell (defined in clause 7.1.1)
for SRS transmission, if the uplink transmission timing changes during
the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The relative UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy in this clause is defined as
accuracy of the difference between two UE Rx-Tx measurements.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.25.2-1 for FR1 are valid under
the following conditions:

Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

PRP\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band.

AWGN propagation condition.

##### 10.1.25.3.1 Absolute UE Rx-Tx Measurement Report Mapping

The reporting range for the absolute UE Rx-Tx time difference
measurement (T~UE\ Rx-Tx~) is defined from -985024×T~c~ to 985024×T~c~
with the resolution step of 2*^k^*×T~c~, where:

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

> *k~min\ ~*= -6 and *k~max\ ~*= 5,
>
> *k≥* *timingReportingGranularityFactor* TS 34.355 \[34\] configured by
> LMF via LPP for the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement.

### 10.1.25A UE Rx-Tx Time Difference Measurement Based on PRS Aggregation

#### 10.1.25A.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.25A apply provided the UE has received
*nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP TS
37.355 \[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements, defined in TS 38.215 \[4\], performed by
aggregating PRS resources on multiple PFLs. The requirements in clause
10.1.25A apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

#### 10.1.25A.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period or

if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within -160, 160 msec of at least one DL PRS
resource of each of the TRPs in the assistance data.

**- PRS resources linked for aggregation saftisfy all the conditions
specified in TS 38.214 \[26\] clause 5.1.6.5.3.**

**-** the spacing between the center frequencies of adjacent PFLs
containing **PRS resources linked for aggregation** does not exceed the
nominal channel spacing for intra-band contiguous CA defined in TS
38.101-1 \[18\], clause 5.4A.1 for FR1 and in TS 38.101-2 \[19\], clause
5.4A.1 for FR2-1.

If the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the autonomous timing adjustment defined in
clause 7.1.2 then:

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall apply for a cell,
which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in clause 7.1.1) for
SRS transmission even if the uplink transmission timing changes during
the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall not apply for a
cell, which is not the downlink reference cell (defined in clause 7.1.1)
for SRS transmission, if the uplink transmission timing changes during
the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.25A.2-1 for FR1 are valid under
the following conditions:

Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

PRP\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band.

AWGN propagation condition.

#### 10.1.25A.3 Report mapping

Applicable measurement report mappings are defined in clause 10.1.25.3.

### 10.1.25C UE Rx-Tx Time Difference Measurements in Satellite Accesss

#### 10.1.25C.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.25C shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP \[31\] requesting the UE to report one or more UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in
clause 10.1.25C shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG or without MG.

#### 10.1.25C.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

**-** N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period or

**-** if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within -160, 160 msec of at least one DL PRS
resource of each of the TRPs corresponding to the serving cell in the
assistance data.

If the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the autonomous timing adjustment defined in
clause 7.1C.2 then:

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall apply for a cell,
which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in clause 7.1C.1) for
SRS transmission even if the uplink transmission timing changes during
the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.25C.2-1 for FR1-NTN are valid
under the following conditions:

**-** Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-5 \[18\] for
reference sensitivity are fulfilled.

**-** PRP\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band.

**-** AWGN propagation condition.

in AWGN with reduced measurement samples

### 10.1.27 L1-SINR accuracy requirements for FR1

#### 10.1.27.1 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and no dedicated IMR configured

##### 10.1.27.1.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RS based
L1-SINR accuracy in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources configured
as CMR and no dedicated resource configured as IMR of the serving cell
configured for L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.27.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.27.1.1-1.

##### 10.1.27.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative CSI-RS based L1-SINR accuracy is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-SINR among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.27.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.27.1.2-1.

#### 10.1.27.2 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with SSB based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

##### 10.1.27.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute SSB based
L1-SINR accuracy in this clause apply to all SSBs configured as CMR and
dedicated resources configured as IMR of the serving cell configured for
L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.27.2.1-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.27.2.1-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.27.2.1-1 and 10.1.27.2.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.27.2.1-1 and
10.1.27.2.1-2.

##### 10.1.27.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-SINR accuracy is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one SSB configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all SSBs and
IMRs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.27.2.2-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.27.2.2-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.27.2.2-1 and 10.1.27.2.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.27.2.2-1 and
10.1.27.2.2-2.

#### 10.1.27.3 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and dedicated IMR configured

##### 10.1.27.3.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RS based
L1-SINR accuracy in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources configured
as CMR and dedicated resources configured as IMR of the serving cell
configured for L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.27.3.1-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.27.3.1-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.27.3.1-1 and 10.1.27.3.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and
ZP-IMR is equal to or better than the accuracy requirements in tables
10.1.27.3.1-1 and 10.1.27.3.1-2.

##### 10.1.27.3.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative CSI-RS based L1-SINR accuracy is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all CSI-RS and
IMR resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.27.3.2-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.27.3.2-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.27.3.2-1 and 10.1.27.3.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and
ZP-IMR is equal to or better than the accuracy requirements in tables
10.1.27.3.2-1 and 10.1.27.3.2-2.

### 10.1.28 L1-SINR accuracy requirements for FR2

10.1.28.1 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and no
dedicated IMR configured

10.1.28.1.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RS based
L1-SINR accuracy in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources configured
as CMR and no dedicated resource configured as IMR of the serving cell
configured for L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.28.1.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.28.1.1-1.

10.1.28.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative CSI-RS based L1-SINR accuracy is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS compared to the largest measured value of
L1-SINR among all CSI-RS resources of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.28.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR is equal to or
better than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1.28.1.2-1.

10.1.28.2 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with SSB based CMR and dedicated
IMR configured

10.1.28.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute SSB based
L1-SINR accuracy in this clause apply to all SSBs configured as CMR and
dedicated resources configured as IMR of the serving cell configured for
L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.28.2.1-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.28.2.1-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.28.2.1-1 and 10.1.28.2.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- SSB based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.28.2.1-1 and
10.1.28.2.1-2.

10.1.28.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-SINR accuracy is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one SSB configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all SSB based
CMRs and IMRs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.28.2.2-1 for SSB
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.28.2.2-2 for SSB based CMR and
ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.28.2.2-1 and 10.1.28.2.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- SSB based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is equal to
or better than the accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.28.2.2-1 and
10.1.28.2.2-2.

10.1.28.3 L1-SINR accuracy requirements with CSI-RS based CMR and
dedicated IMR configured

10.1.28.3.1 Absolute Accuracy

Unless otherwise specified, the requirements for absolute CSI-RS based
L1-SINR accuracy in this clause apply to all CSI-RS resources as CMR and
dedicated resources configured as IMR of the serving cell configured for
L1-SINR measurement.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.28.3.1-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.28.3.1-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.28.3.1-1 and 10.1.28.3.1-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- CSI-RS based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and
ZP-IMR is equal to or better than the accuracy requirements in tables
10.1.28.3.1-1 and 10.1.28.3.1-2.

10.1.28.3.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative CSI-RS based L1-SINR accuracy is defined as the L1-SINR
measured from one CSI-RS configured as CMR and one IMR configured as IMR
compared to the largest measured value of L1-SINR among all CSI-RS based
CMRs and IMRs of the serving cell.

The accuracy requirements are defined in table 10.1.28.3.2-1 for CSI-RS
based CMR and NZP-IMR and in table 10.1.28.3.2-2 for CSI-RS based CMR
and ZP-IMR.

The accuracy requirements in tables 10.1.28.3.2-1 and 10.1.28.3.2-2 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-SINR measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.8.3 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS based CMR and
IMR.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and ZP-IMR is 48 PRBs and the
density is 3.

\- The measured signals are in the directions covered by the percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the UE, defined in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2
\[19\].

\- AWGN radio propagation conditions.

\- CSI-RS based CMR and IMR in the test come from the same direction.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS as CMR, NZP-IMR and
ZP-IMR is equal to or better than the accuracy requirements in tables
10.1.28.3.2-1 and 10.1.28.3.2-2.

##### 10.1.30.1.2 Relative SS-RSRQ Accuracy

The relative SS-RSRQ accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
RSRQ measured from one cell on a frequency compared to the RSRP measured
from another cell on a different frequency, with at least one of the two
frequencies being under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.30.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.10 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1 dB~m~ - SSB\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

##### 10.1.32.1.2 Relative SS-SINR Accuracy

The relative SS-SINR accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
SS-SINR measured from one cell on a frequency compared to the SS-SINR
measured from another cell on a different frequency, with at least one
of the two frequencies being under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.32.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.10 for a corresponding Band.

##### 10.1.33.1.2 Relative Accuracy

The relative SSB based L1-RSRP accuracy is defined as the L1-RSRP
measured from one SSB compared to the largest measured value of L1-RSRP
among all SSBs of the serving cell under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.33.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.10.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

### 10.1.34 RSSI measurements under CCA 

#### 10.1.34.1 Intra-frequency absolute RSSI measurement accuracy requirements in FR1

The accuracy requirements for intra-frequency RSSI measurements on a
carrier frequency under CCA are specified in table 10.1.34.1-1. The
requirements apply for any configured RSSI *measDuration* \[2\],
provided that:

\- All symbols during each RSSI measurement duration are available for
RSSI sampling within the same reporting interval.

The intra-frequency RSSI measurement bandwidth is the channel bandwidth
defined in clause 4 of TS 37.213 \[33\], where the channel has the
center frequency configured by *ARFCN-valueNR*.

##### 10.1.37.1.2 Relative SS-RSRP Accuracy

The relative SS-RSRP accuracy in inter-frequency case is defined as the
RSRP measured from one cell on a frequency compared to the RSRP measured
from another cell on a different frequency, with at least one of the two
frequencies being under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.37.1.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for inter-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.9 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

\- \|SSB\_RP1 dB~m~ - SSB\_RP2 dB~m~\| ≤ 27 dB

\- \|Channel 1\_Io ‑Channel 2\_Io \| ≤ 20 dB

defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in clause 10.1.38 shall
apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state,

\- when UE is in RRC\_IDLE state.

The requirements in clause 10.1.38.2 apply for the first path PRS-RSRP
measurement.

#### 10.1.38.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

##### 10.1.38.2.1 Absolute PRS RSRPP accuracy

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement for FR1
defined in table 10.1.38.2.1-1 and table 10.1.38.2.1-3 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-1 clause 7.3 for reference sensitivity
are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement for FR2
defined in table 10.1.38.2.1-2 and table 10.1.38.2.1-4 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-2 \[19\] clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement defined in
table 10.1.38.2.1-1 and table 10.1.38.2.1-2 apply for the UE not
supporting *supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* \[34\] or LMF does not
indicate UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced number of
samples.

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement defined in
table 10.1.38.2.1-3 and table 10.1.38.2.1-4 apply for the UE supporting
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* \[34\].

NOTE: The requirements in this clause are derived based on two-tap
channel defined in TS 38.101-4 \[21\] annex B.2.4 (a = 1, τ~d~=0.45 µs
and f~D~=5 Hz).

NOTE: The requirements in this clause are derived based on the
difference between the estimated PRS-RSRPP compared to the ideal
PRS-RSRPP defined as

$$\text{RSRPP}_{p} \propto \left| \sum_{k}^{}{H_{k}\exp\left( j2\pi D_{p}\frac{k}{N_{\text{IFFT}}} \right)} \right|^{2}$$

**Where:**

$H_{k}$ **is the effective channel frequency response (over REs occupied
by PRS) measured without receiver noise.**

$D_{p}$ **is the exact delay of the p-th path in the channel model.**

The requirements in clause 10.1.38A.2 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* or
*nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* or
*nr-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP TS
37.355 \[34\] *with a request to perform measurement by aggregating PRS
resources from multiple PFLs via nr-DL-PRS-JointMeasurementRequested*
for UE to report one or more DL PRS-RSRPP measurements defined in TS
38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in clause 10.1.38A.2 shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state, and the measurement is performed
with MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

\- when UE is in RRC\_IDLE state.

The requirements in clause 10.1.38A.2 apply for the first path PRS-RSRP
measurement.

#### 10.1.39.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements for PRS

The error in the reported value of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement,
including both the measurement error and the reporting quantization
error, shall be within the accuracy requirements specified in this
clause.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

\- N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period or

\- if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within -160, 160 msec of at least one PDC DL
PRS resource from the serving cell (PCell).

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.39.2-1 for FR1 are valid under
the following conditions:

Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

#### 10.1.39.3 Measurement Accuracy Requirements for TRS

The error in the reported value of UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement,
including both the measurement error and the reporting quantization
error, shall be within the accuracy requirements specified in this
clause.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

\- N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period or

\- if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within -160, 160 msec of at least one PDC TRS
resource from the serving cell (PCell).

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1.39.3-1 for FR1 are valid under
the following conditions:

Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

PRP\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.13 for a corresponding Band.

AWGN propagation condition.

### 10.1.43 DL-RSCPD Measurements

#### 10.1.43.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.43 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *NR-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message with
*dl-PRS-RSCPD-Request-r18* from LMF via LPP TS 37.355 \[34\] requesting
the UE to measure and report DL RSCPD measurement together with DL RSTD
measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in clause
10.1.43 shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE state.

#### Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The accuracy requirements for DL RSCPD measurement are based on single
measurement sample in single PFL and shall be within ±(X+Y) degree,
provided that the following conditions are met:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled for FR1.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled for FR2.

\- Conditions for DL RSCPD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- The measurements to derive DL RSCPD are performed on PRS resources
within same set of symbols.

\- DL RSCPD measurements are based on PRS resources with comb size other
than 12.

The requirements in this clause are derived based on AWGN channel and on
two-tap channel defined in 38.101-4 \[21\] annex B.2.4 (a = 1, τ~d~=0.45
µs and f~D~=5 Hz).

X is defined in table 10.1.43.2-1 for AWGN channel and table 10.1.43.2-2
for two-tap channel for FR1 and is derived assuming no carrier frequency
offset at TRP.

X is defined in table 10.1.43.2-3 for AWGN channel and table 10.1.43.2-4
for two-tap channel for FR2 and is derived assuming no carrier frequency
offset at TRP.

Y is 14 degrees for FR1 and 28 degrees for FR2.

### 10.1.44 DL-RSCP Measurements

#### 10.1.44.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1.44 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *NR-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message with
*dl-PRS-RSCP-Request-r18* from LMF via LPP TS 37.355 \[34\] requesting
the UE to measure and report DL RSCP measurement together with UE Rx-Tx
time difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

The requirements in clause 10.1.44 shall apply:

\- when UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the measurement is performed
with MG,

\- when UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state.

#### 10.1.44.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The relative accuracy of DL RSCP measurement in this clause is defined
as accuracy of the difference between two DL RSCP measurements, each
based on single measurement sample in single PFL.

The requirements in this clause are derived based on AWGN channel and
based on two-tap channel defined in 38.101-4 \[21\] annex B.2.4 (a = 1,
τ~d~=0.45 µs and f~D~=5 Hz).

The DL RSCP relative measurement accuracy requirements in this clause
shall not apply, if:

\- N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 changes during the DL RSCP
with UE Rx-Tx measurement period, or

\- if the uplink transmission timing changes during the DL RSCP with UE
Rx-Tx measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The DL RSCP relative measurement accuracy requirements in this clause
shall apply provided that:

**- The** UE transmits SRS within \[-160, 160\] msec of at least one DL
PRS resource of each of the TRPs in the assistance data.

If the uplink transmission timing changes during the DL RSCP with UE
Rx-Tx measurement period due to the autonomous timing adjustment defined
in clause 7.1.2 then:

\- DL RSCP and UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall apply
for a cell, which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in
section 7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall not apply for a
cell, which is not the downlink reference cell (defined in section
7.1.1) for SRS transmission.

When a serving cell change occurs during the DL RSCP with UE Rx-Tx
measurement period, UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements and DL
RSCP measurement requirements do not apply.

The relative DL RSCP accuracy requirements defined in clause 10.1.44 are
valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled for FR1.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-2 \[19\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled for FR2.

\- Conditions for DL RSCP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.14 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- DL RSCP measurements to derive the relative accuracy are performed on
PRS resources within the same set of symbols.

\- DL RSCPD measurements are based on PRS resources with comb size other
than 12.

The accuracy requirement for relative DL-RSCP shall be within ±(X+Y)
degree.

The values of X for accuracy requirements for relative DL-RSCP
measurement in FR1 are defined in table 10.1.44.2-1 for AWGN channel and
in table 10.1.44.2-2 for two-tap channel and is derived assuming no
carrier frequency offset at TRP.

The values of X for accuracy requirements for relative DL-RSCP
measurement in FR2 are defined in table 10.1.44.2-3 for AWGN channel and
in table 10.1.44.2-4 for two-tap channel and is derived assuming no
carrier frequency offset at TRP.

Y is 14 degrees for FR1 and 28 degrees for FR2.

10.1A NR measurements for RedCap
--------------------------------

### 10.1A.1 Introduction

The requirements in this clause are applicable for RedCap UE as follows:

\- intra-frequency requirements apply for PCell measurements in SA,

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for non-serving cell measurements
on NR carrier frequencies.

\- inter-frequency requirements apply for measurements from one cell on
a frequency compared to the measurement from another cell on a different
frequency.

The accuracy requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio
propagation conditions. The accuracy requirements of RSRP, RSRQ and SINR
are applicable provided that reference SSB is not changed during
measurement period.

### 10.1A.2 Intra-frequency RSRP accuracy requirements for FR1

#### 10.1A.2.1 Intra-frequency SS-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1A.2.1.1 Absolute SS-RSRP Accuracy

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.2.1.1 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in table 10.1A.2.1.1-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for intra-frequency measurements are fulfilled according
to annex B.2.15 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SSB.

#### 10.1A.14.2 CSI-RS based L1-RSRP accuracy requirements

##### 10.1A.14.2.1 Absolute Accuracy

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.19.2.2 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in table 10.1A.14.2.1-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1A.19.2.1-1.

##### 10.1A.14.2.2 Relative Accuracy

The accuracy requirements in clause 10.1.19.2.2 shall apply when RedCap
UE is capable of 2Rx. When UE is only required to support 1RX, the
absolute accuracy requirements in table 10.1A.14.2.2-1 are valid under
the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3I of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for L1-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.2.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant CSI-RS.

\- The bandwidth of CSI-RS is 48 PRBs and the density is 3.

The performance with larger bandwidth of CSI-RS is equal to or better
than the accuracy requirements in table 10.1A.14.2.2-1.

### 10.1A.16 RSTD Measurements for RedCap Positioning 

#### 10.1A.16.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1A.16 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via
LPP TS 37.355 \[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more DL RSTD
measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

The requirements in clause 10.1A.16 shall apply,

\- When the RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the RSTD
measurement is performed with and without RX FH within measurement gap.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the RSTD measurement is
performed without RX FH outside of the measurement gap.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the RSTD measurement is
performed without RX FH when both PPW and measurement gap is configured.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state and the RSTD measurement is
performed with and without RX FH.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_IDLE state and the RSTD measurement is
performed with and without RX FH.

The requirements defined in clause 10.1A.16 are valid under the
conditions defined in clause 10.1.23.

#### 10.1A.16.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The accuracy requirements for RSTD measurement shall be within
±(X+Y+Z+Δ) T~c~. The values of Y, Z and Δ and Rx TEG based requirement
are as defined in clause 10.1.23.2. For Rx FH, PRS BW in tables
10.1.23.2-5, 10.1.23.2-5a, 10.1.23.2-6, and 10.1.23.2-6a refer to per
hop BW. The requirements for fading channel in this clause are derived
based on TDL-A (30 ns delay spread, 5Hz) and TDL-C (60 ns delay spread,
300 Hz) channel models for FR1 and FR2, respectively.

##### 10.1A.16.2.1 Accuracy requirement for RSTD measurement without RX FH

For 4 sample RSTD measurement performed by 2Rx RedCap UE without RX FH,
the values of X, corresponding to the PRS bandwidth supported by the
RedCap UE for PRS measurement without RX FH, in tables 10.1.23.2-1 in
FR1 for AWGN, 10.1.23.2-2 in FR2 for AWGN, 10.1.23.2-3 in FR1 for fading
channel, and 10.1.23.2-4 in FR2 for fading channel apply.

For reduced sample RSTD measurement performed by 2Rx RedCap UE without
RX FH, the values of X, corresponding to the PRS bandwidth supported by
the RedCap UE for PRS measurement without RX FH, in tables 10.1.23.2-7
in FR1 for AWGN, and 10.1.23.2-8 in FR2 for AWGN apply.

The value of X for 4 sample RSTD measurement performed by 1Rx RedCap UE
without RX FH is defined in table 10.1A.16.2.1-1 in FR1 for AWGN, and in
table 10.1A.16.2.1-2 in FR1 for fading channel.

The value of X for reduced sample RSTD measurement performed by 1Rx
RedCap UE without RX FH is defined in table 10.1A.16.2.1-3 in FR1 for
AWGN.

### 10.1A.17 PRS-RSRP Measurements for RedCap positioning

#### 10.1A.17.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1A.17 shall apply, provided the UE has
received *nr-DL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* or
*nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* or
*nr-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF via LPP TS
37.355 \[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more DL PRS-RSRP
measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

The requirements in clause 10.1A.17 shall apply,

\- When the RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the PRS-RSRP
measurement is performed with and without RX FH within measurement gap.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the PRS-RSRP
measurement is performed without RX FH outside of the measurement gap.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the PRS-RSRP
measurement is performed without RX FH when both PPW and measurement gap
is configured.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state and the PRS-RSRP measurement
is performed with and without RX FH.

\- When RedCap UE is in RRC\_IDLE state and the PRS-RSRP measurement is
performed with and without RX FH.

The requirements defined in clause 10.1A.17 are valid under the
conditions defined in clause 10.1.24.1.

#### 10.1A.17.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

##### 10.1A.17.2.1 Absolute PRS RSRP Accuracy Requirement

Accuracy requirement, corresponding to the PRS bandwidth supported by
the RedCap UE for measurement without RX FH, defined in clause
10.1.24.2.1 apply to the PRS-RSRP measurement performed by 2Rx RedCap UE
without RX FH.

Accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.24.2.1 apply to the PRS-RSRP
measurement performed by 2Rx RedCap UE with RX FH, where the PRS
bandwidth in clause 10.1.24.2.1 correspond to the PRS bandwidth measured
by the RedCap UE per hop.

Accuracy requirement in table 10.1A.17.2.1-1 applies to the 4-sample
PRS-RSRP measurement performed by 1Rx RedCap UE without RX FH.

Accuracy requirement in table 10.1A.17.2.1-2 applies to reduced sample
PRS-RSRP measurement performed by 1Rx RedCap UE without RX FH

Accuracy requirement in table 10.1A.17.2.1-1 and table 10.1A.17.2.1-2
apply to the PRS-RSRP measurement performed by 1Rx RedCap UE with RX FH,
where the PRS bandwidth in table 10.1A.17.2.1-1 and table 10.1A.17.2.1-2
correspond to the PRS bandwidth measured by the RedCap UE per hop.

##### 10.1A.17.2.2 Relative PRS RSRP Accuracy Requirement

Relative accuracy requirement, corresponding to the PRS bandwidth
supported by the RedCap UE for measurement without RX FH, defined in
clause 10.1.24.2.2 apply to the PRS-RSRP measurement performed by 2Rx
RedCap UE without RX FH.

Relative accuracy requirement in clause 10.1.24.2.2 apply to the
PRS-RSRP measurement performed by 2Rx RedCap UE with RX FH, where the
PRS bandwidth in clause 10.1.24.2.2 correspond to the PRS bandwidth
measured by the RedCap UE per hop.

#### 10.1A.17.3 Report Mapping

##### 10.1A.17.3.1 Absolute PRS-RSRP Measurement Report Mapping 

Measurement reporting range and report mapping tables defined in clause
10.1.24.3.1 apply to PRS-RSRP measurement reporting for both 1Rx and 2Rx
RedCap UEs and PRS-RSRP measurement performed with and without RX FH.

##### 10.1A.17.3.2 Differential Report Mapping for PRS-RSRP Measurement 

Measurement reporting range and report mapping tables defined in clause
10.1.24.3.2 apply to PRS-RSRP measurement reporting for both 1Rx and 2Rx
RedCap UEs and PRS-RSRP measurement performed with and without RX FH.

### 10.1A.18 UE Rx-Tx Time Difference Measurements for RedCap Positioning

#### 10.1A.18.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1A.18 shall apply, provided the RedCap UE
has received *nr-Multi-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF
via LPP TS 37.355 \[34\] requesting the UE to report one or more UE
Rx-Tx time difference measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The
requirements in clause 10.1A.18 shall apply:

­ When the RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement is performed with and without RX FH within
measurement gap.

­ When RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement is performed without RX FH outside of the
measurement gap.

­ When RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state and the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement is performed without RX FH when both PPW and
measurement gap is configured.

­ When RedCap UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state and the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurement is performed with and without RX FH.

#### 10.1A.18.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall not apply, if:

**-** N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1A.2-2 changes during the UE
Rx-Tx measurement period or

**-** if the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the network-configured Timing Advance.

The UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements in this
clause shall apply provided that:

> **- The** UE transmits SRS within -160, 160 msec of at least one DL
> PRS resource of each of the TRPs in the assistance data.

If the uplink transmission timing changes during the UE Rx-Tx
measurement period due to the autonomous timing adjustment defined in
clause 7.1A.2 then:

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall apply for a cell,
which is also the downlink reference cell (defined in clause 7.1A.1) for
SRS transmission even if the uplink transmission timing changes during
the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

\- UE Rx-Tx measurement accuracy requirements shall not apply for a
cell, which is not the downlink reference cell (defined in clause
7.1A.1) for SRS transmission, if the uplink transmission timing changes
during the UE Rx-Tx measurement period due to autonomous adjustment.

When a serving cell change occurs during the UE Rx-Tx measurement
period, the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement accuracy requirements
in this clause shall apply provided that the serving cell change does
not impact SRS configuration for the UE Rx-Tx measurement.

The relative accuracy of UE Rx-Tx measurement in this clause is defined
as accuracy of the difference between two UE Rx-Tx measurements.

##### 10.1A.18.2.1 UE Rx-Tx Accuracy Requirement for 2RX RedCap UE without FH

For UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement performed by 2RX RedCap UE
without RX FH, the accuracy requirements corresponding to the PRS
bandwidth supported by the RedCap UE for PRS measurement without RX FH
in clause 10.1.25.2 shall apply.

##### 10.1A.18.2.2 UE Rx-Tx Accuracy Requirement for 1RX RedCap UE without FH

The accuracy requirements in table 10.1A.18.2.2-1 for FR1 are valid
under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3 of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- PRP\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band.

\- AWGN propagation condition.

#### 10.1A.18.3 Report mapping

##### 10.1A.18.3.1 Absolute UE Rx-Tx Measurement Report Mapping

The report mapping as defined in clause 10.1.25.3.1 shall apply.

##### 10.1A.18.3.2 Differential UE Rx-Tx Measurement Report Mapping 

The report mapping as defined in clause 10.1.25.3.2 shall apply.

##### 10.1A.18.3.3 Additional Path Report Mapping for UE Rx-Tx Time Difference

The report mapping as defined in clause 10.1.25.3.3 shall apply.

### 10.1A.19 PRS-RSRPP Measurements for RedCap Positioning 

#### 10.1A.19.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.1A.19.2 shall apply, provided the RedCap
UE has received *nr-DL-AoD-RequestLocationInformation* message from LMF
via LPP 37.355 \[34\] requesting the RedCap UE to report one or more DL
PRS-RSRPP measurements defined in TS 38.215 \[4\]. The requirements in
clause 10.1A.19 shall apply:

\- when RedCap UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED state,

\- when RedCap UE is in RRC\_INACTIVE state,

\- when RedCap UE is in RRC\_IDLE state.

The requirements in clause 10.1A.19.2 apply for the first path PRS-RSRP
measurement.

#### 10.1A.19.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

##### 10.1A.19.2.1 Absolute PRS RSRPP accuracy

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurements for 1Rx
RedCap UE for FR1 defined in table 10.1A.19.2.1-1 and table
10.1A.19.2.1-2 are valid under the following conditions:

\- Conditions defined in TS 38.101-1 \[18\] clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to annex B.2.14 for a corresponding Band.

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurements defined in
clause 10.1.38.2.1 are reused for 2Rx RedCap UE.

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement defined in
table 10.1A.19.2.1-1 apply for the RedCap UE not supporting
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* TS 37.355 \[34\] or LMF does not
indicate RedCap UE to perform positioning measurements with reduced
number of samples.

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement defined in
table 10.1A.19.2.1-2 apply for the RedCap UE supporting
*supportedDL-PRS-ProcessingSamples* TS 37.355 \[34\].

The absolute accuracy requirements for PRS-RSRPP measurement defined in
this clause apply to the measurements with and without frequency
hopping. For the measurements with frequency hopping, the accuracy
requirements apply for the corresponding PRS bandwidth per hop.

NOTE 1: The requriements in this clause are derived based on two-tap
channel defined in TS 38.101-4 \[21\] annex B.2.4 (a = 1, τ~d~=0.45 µs
and f~D~=5 Hz).

NOTE 2: The requirements in this clause are derived based on the
difference between the estimated PRS-RSRPP compared to the ideal
PRS-RSRPP defined as

$$\text{RSRPP}_{p} \propto \left| \sum_{k}^{}{H_{k}\exp\left( j2\pi D_{p}\frac{k}{N_{\text{IFFT}}} \right)} \right|^{2}$$

**Where:**

$H_{k}$ **is the effective channel frequency response (over REs occupied
by PRS) measured without receiver noise.**

$D_{p}$ **is the exact delay of the p-th path in the channel model.**

### 10.4.2A Intra-frequency PSBCH-RSRP accuracy requirements for FR1 under CCA

#### 10.4.2A.1 PSBCH-RSRP Absolute Accuracy

The requirements for absolute PSBCH-RSRP accuracy in this clause apply
to a sidelink synchronization source on the same frequency as that of
the own sidelink UE performing the measurement in FR1 under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.4.2A.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Demodulation reference signals are transmitted from one port.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3E of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for PSBCH-RSRP measurements are fulfilled according to
annex B.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant PSBCH-DMRS.

#### 10.4.2A.2 PSBCH-RSRP Relative Accuracy

The relative PSBCH-RSRP accuracy is defined as the PSBCH-RSRP measured
from one sidelink synchronization source compared to the PSBCH-RSRP
measured from another sidelink synchronization source on the same
frequency in FR1 under CCA.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.4.2A.2-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Demodulation reference signals are transmitted from one port.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3F of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for PSBCH-RSRP accuracy measurements are fulfilled
according to annex B.4.2 for a corresponding Band for each relevant
PSBCH-DMRS.

\- The same number of S-SSB repetitions on frequency domain is
configured between two sidelink synchronization sources.

### 10.4.5 Intra-Frequency Discovery Signal Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a remote sidelink UE
in U2N relay scenario provided that the remote UE:

\- is out of coverage on the frequency used for sidelink, and

\- that is synchronised to the sidelink relay UE that is measured.

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a remote sidelink UE
in multipath relay scenario provided that the remote UE:

\- is synchronised to the sidelink relay UE that is measured and

\- is in coverage on the frequency used for sidelink if both the direct
path and the sidelink on the indirect path are on the same frequency

\- is out of coverage on the frequency used for sidelink if the direct
path and the sidelink on the indirect path are on different frequencies.

#### 10.4.5.1 Absolute Discovery Signal Measurement Accuracy

The accuracy requirements for absolute discovery signal measurement in
this clause apply to a sidelink UE performing SL-RSRP measurements for
direct to indirect path switch or SL-RSRP measurements for indirect to
direct path switch on the same frequency as used by the sidelink relay
UE transmitting the relay Discovery message.

The accuracy requirements in table 10.4.5.1-1 are valid under the
following conditions:

\- Demodulation reference signals for PSCCH and/or PSSCH are transmitted
from one port.

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3E of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- PSCCH-RSRP\|dBm and/or PSSCH-RSRP\|dBm according to annex B.4.4 for a
corresponding Band are fulfilled.

10.4A NR Sidelink Measurements for Positioning
----------------------------------------------

### 10.4A.1 Introduction

The SL measurements for positioning are performed based on SL-PRS. The
SL-PRS reception procedure is as described in TS 38.321 \[7\]. The UE
shall monitor PSCCH to receive the associated SL-PRS in the same slot TS
38.214 \[26\].

### 10.4A.2 SL RSTD measurements

#### 10.4A.2.1 Measurement Report Mapping

##### 10.4A.2.1.1 Absolute SL RSTD Measurement Reporting

The reporting range for the SL RSTD measurement is defined from
-985024×T~c~ to 985024×T~c~ with the resolution step of 2*^k^*×T~c~,
where

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min~*=2 and *k~max~*=5, when configured SL-PRS resources of both of
the reference UE and the second anchor UE measured for the SL RSTD
measurement are in FR1.

The measurement report mapping for different *k* values are specified in
tables 10.4A.2.1.1-1 − 10.4A.2.1.1-4.

#### 10.4A.2.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

The accuracy requirements for SL RSTD measurement shall be within
±(X+Y+Z) T~c~, where X, Y, and Z are defined as follows.

X is defined in table 10.4A.2.2-1 for AWGN propagation condition and
table 10.4A.2.2-2 for fading propagation condition in FR1, provided that
the following conditions are met:

\- Conditions defined in clause 7.3E of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- Conditions for SL RSTD measurements are fulfilled according to annex
B.4A.1 for a corresponding Band for each relevant SL-PRS resource
configured for measurement.

\- Y=32 Tc, provided that the time offset between the two SL-PRS

### 10.4A.4 SL Rx-Tx measurements

#### 10.4A.4.1 Measurement Report Mapping

##### 10.4A.4.1.1 Absolute SL Rx-Tx Measurement Report Mapping

The reporting range for the absolute SL Rx-Tx time difference
measurement (T~SL\ Rx-Tx~) is defined from -985024´T~c~ to 985024´T~c~
with the resolution step of 2*^k^*´T~c~, where:

T~c~ is defined in TS 38.211 \[6\],

*k~min~*≤*k*≤*k~max~*,

*k~min~*=2 and *k~max~*=5, when both of the transmitted SL-PRS and the
received SL-PRS resources configured for T~SL\ Rx-Tx~ are in FR1.

The T~SL\ Rx-Tx~ report mapping for *k* = 2, 3, 4, and 5 are specified
in tables 10.4A.4.1.1-1, 10.4A.4.1.1-2, 10.4A.4.1.1-3, and
10.4A.4.1.1-4, respectively.

#### 10.4A.4.2 Measurement Accuracy

The accuracy requirements for SL Rx-Tx time difference measurement shall
be within ±(X+Y+δ) T~c~, where X, Y, and δ are defined as follows.

X is defined in table 10.4A.4.2-1 for AWGN propagation condition and
table 10.4A.4.2-2 for fading propagation condition in FR1, provided that
the following conditions are met:

**-** Conditions defined in clause 7.3E of TS 38.101-1 \[18\] for
reference sensitivity are fulfilled.

**- SL** PRP\|~dBm~ according to annex B.4A.1 for a corresponding Band.

**- The** UE transmits SL PRS within -160, 160 msec of at least one SL
PRS resource of each of the anchor UEs in the assistance data.

**-** N~TA\_offset~ defined in table 7.1.2-2 does not change during the
UE Rx-Tx measurement period when the reference timing used for SL PRS
transmissions is a NR serving cell.

If UE indicates *tx-TimeInfo* when reporting SL Rx-Tx time difference
results, the frequency drift margin Y=32 Tc, provided that the time
offset between the SL PRS transmission and reception, which are used for
a single SL Rx-Tx estimate, is no greater than 160 ms. Otherwise, Y=0.

Margin δ are defined in table 10.4A.4.2-3.

#### 10.4A.5.2 Measurement Accuracy

##### 10.4A.5.2.1 Introduction

The requirements in clause 10.4A.5.2 shall apply provided the UE has
received *SL-TDOA-RequestLocationInformation* or
*SL-AOA-RequestLocationInformation* or
*SL-TOA-RequestLocationInformation* or
*SL-RTT-RequestLocationInformation* from LMF or another UE via SLPP
requesting the UE to measure and report SL PRS-RSRPP measurements
defined in TS 38.215 \[4\].

The requirements in clause 10.4A.5.2 apply for the first path SL
PRSRSRPP measurement.

##### 10.4A.5.2.2 Measurement Accuracy Requirements

###### 10.4A.5.2.2.2 Absolute SL PRS-RSRPP accuracy

The absolute accuracy requirements for SL PRS-RSRPP measurement for FR1
defined in table 10.4A.5.2.2.2-1 are valid under the following
conditions:

\- Conditions defined in 38.101-1 \[18\] clause 7.3E for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- PRP 1,2\|~dBm~ according to annex B.4A.1 for a corresponding Band.

NOTE 1: The requriements in this clause are derived based on two-tap
channel defined in TS 38.101-4 \[21\] annex B.2.4 (a = 1, τ~d~=0.45 µs
and f~D~=5 Hz).

NOTE 2: The requirements in this clause are derived based on the
difference between the estimated SL PRSRSRPP compared to the ideal SL
PRSRSRPP defined as

$$\text{RSRPP}_{p} \propto \left| \sum_{k}^{}{H_{k}\exp\left( j2\pi D_{p}\frac{k}{N_{\text{IFFT}}} \right)} \right|^{2}$$

**where:**

$H_{k}$ is the effective channel frequency response (over REs occupied
by SL-PRS) measured without receiver noise.

$D_{p}$ is the exact delay of the p-th path in the channel model.
