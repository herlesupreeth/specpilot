4 Background
============

Air-to-ground (ATG) network refers to in-flight connectivity technique,
using ground-based cell towers that send signals up to an aircraft's
antenna(s) of onboard ATG terminal. As a plane travels into different
sections of airspace, the onboard ATG terminal automatically connects to
the cell with strongest received signal power, just as a mobile phone
does on the ground. In this network, a direct radio link will be
established between BS on the ground and CPE type of UE mounted in the
aircraft.

From the trials and commercial operation
\[https://inflight.telekom.net/ean/\] of adapted LTE ATG solutions, some
characteristics are considered for ATG network deployment scenarios.

**- Extremely large inter-site distance (ISD) and large coverage
range:** In order to control the network deployment cost and considering
the limited number of flights, large ISD is preferred, e.g., about 100km
to 200km. At the same time, when the plane is above the sea, the
distance between the plane and the nearest base station could be more
than 200km and even up to 300km. Therefore, ATG network should be able
to provide up to 300km cell coverage range.

**- Utilizing non-disjoint frequency for deploying both ATG and
terrestrial networks, i.e. same operating band but ATG network and TN
use adjacent carriers:** Operators are interested to adopt the same
frequency for deploying both ATG and terrestrial networks to save
frequency resource cost, while interference between ATG and terrestrial
networks becomes non-negligible and should be addressed.

**- Much powerful on-board ATG terminal capacity:** On-board ATG
terminal can be much powerful than normal terrestrial UE, e.g., with
higher EIRP via much larger transmission power and/or much larger
on-board antenna gain.

5 ATG bands
===========

ATG will operate within existing NR operating bands and does not need
new bands. Depending on the operator's request so far, the following NR
bands are intended for ATG deployment in Rel-18. Other new band request
for ATG deployment is not precluded in future.

14. For simulation cases 2, 3, 10, 11, if evidence is brought forward
that the ACLR/ACS requirements to cover co-location are substantially
different to the requirements for the non-co-location, then discuss
further how to cover both cases.

6.2 Co-existence simulation assumption
--------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Network layout model

#### 6.2.1.1 Co-existence between ATG and NR terrestrial network

Co-existence modelling is based on positioning a single ATG BS/sector
and a TN cluster. Two options exist for the positioning of the TN
cluster relative to the ATG BS.

For simulation cases 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14 the worst-case network
layout for simulation is one in which the TN cluster is placed at the
same location as the ATG BS. The ATG BS are offset from the TN BS with
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\text{ISD}_{\text{TN}}$ as depicted in figure
6.2.1.1-2.

Figure 6.2.1.1-2 Offset of ATG BS compared to TN BS grid when the TN
cluster is located close to the ATG BS

For the remaining simulation cases, if the ATG UE has an
omni-directional radiation pattern then the worst-case network layout
for simulation is one in which the TN is placed directly below the
aircraft. If the UE has a directional radiation pattern, then in these
cases companies should assess which of the network layout options (TN
placed close to ATG BS or TN placed underneath the aircraft) is worst
case and apply the worst-case option.

#### 6.2.1.3 ATG Network Layout

*A single ATG BS with a single cell is assumed for the ATG network. The
aircraft are assumed to fly in a straight line from the minimum distance
to the maximum horizontal distance from the ATG BS in the horizontal
boresight of the ATG sector. The minimum and maximum horizontal distance
of the ATG UE from the ATG BS are as depicted in table 6.2.1.3-1 and
depend on the assumption of sub-arrays or not for the antenna model.*

*In the vertical domain, ATG UEs are distributed in height between 3000m
and 10000m.*

antenna)

For Scenarios 2, 3, 10, 11, in addition to simulations in the above
assumptions some extra simulations were carried out in which the ATG UE
is assumed to be around 300km from the ATG BS. The TN network is also
located at 300km, and the ATG UE is assumed to be positioned within a
straight line from the ATG BS and within the TN ground network area.

For Scenario 2,3,10,11, it is agreed to conclude simulation results
based on that ATG UEs flying over a TN cluster while ATG BS is 100km
away as shown below.

\- Optional: ATG BS is 300km away.

#### 6.2.3.2 ATG UE antenna model

For 2GHz, assume omni-directional antenna, assume 40dBm UE output power
for calibration (as worst case for simulation purposes).

For 4GHz, assume that UE is equipped with directional antenna, assume a
UE EIRP of 43dBm for calibration (as worst case for simulation purposes)

\- Use following as the starting point for calibration.

#### 6.2.3.4 TN UE antenna model

The following assumption for TN UE antenna is shown as below.

  -------------------------------- ------------------------------------

  Tx/Rx Antenna gain               0 dBi per element
  the number of Tx and Rx          1T2R

### 6.2.4 ACLR and ACS modelling

For DL it seems reasonable from the perspective of simulating worst case
scenarios that we assume BS ACLR is modelled as flat in space, and the
UE ACS can be modelled flat in space.

If this assumption is for DL, then the similar assumption could be made
for the UL.

Therefore, it is assumed that both ACLR ( or the adjacent channel
interference) and ACS are flat in both space and frequency. The ACIR
model can be express as:

(Assuming ACLR, ACS and ACIR to be linear).

The ACLR/ACS requirements for TN are defined as below.

+--------------+------+--------------+
| NR TN system |      |              |
+==============+======+==============+
| BS           | ACLR | 45 dB        |
+--------------+------+--------------+
|              | ACS  | 46 dB        |
+--------------+------+--------------+
| UE           | ACLR | 30dB (ACLR1) |
|              |      |              |
|              |      | 43dB (ACLR2) |
+--------------+------+--------------+

+--------------+------+--------------+

### 6.2.5 Propagation model

#### 6.2.5.1 Propagation model between TN UE and ATG UE

Referring to section 6.6 in TR 38.811, the propagation model between TN
UE and ATG UE can be simplified and summarized as below.

**LOS probability**

Line-Of-Sight (LOS) probability depends on UE environment and elevation
angle, and is obtained from Table 6.2.5.1-1. Reference elevation angles
are considered from 10° to 90° with a 10° step. For an ATG UE-to-ATG BS,
the LOS probability is taken from the nearest reference elevation angle.

Table 6.2.5.1-1 LOS probability

  Elevation   Suburban and Rural scenarios
  ----------- ------------------------------
  10°         78.2%
  20°         86.9%
  30°         91.9%
  40°         92.9%
  50°         93.5%
  60°         94.0%
  70°         94.9%
  80°         95.2%
  90°         99.8%

**Path loss and Shadow fading**

The signal path between ATG UE and ATG BS undergoes several stages of
propagation and attenuation. The path loss (PL) is composed of
components as follows:

$PL = \text{PL}_{b} = FSPL\left( d,\ f_{c} \right) + SF + CL\left( \alpha,\ f_{c} \right)$,
(6.2.5.1-1)

where is the total path loss in dB,

is the basic path loss in dB,

This section specifies the basic path loss model () which accounts for
the signal\'s free space propagation, clutter loss, and shadow fading.

The free space path loss (FSPL) in dB for a separation distance *d*
(between ATG UE and ATG BS) in meter and frequency $f_{c}$ in GHz is
given by

![](./media/image15.wmf){width="3.1777777777777776in"
height="0.2513888888888889in"} (6.6-2)

is clutter loss, and is shadow fading loss represented by a random
number generated by the normal distribution, i.e., \~. When the UE is in
LOS condition, clutter loss is negligible and should be set to 0 dB in
the basic path loss model.

Table 6.2.5.1-2: Shadow fading and clutter loss for suburban and rural
scenarios

  90°         0.72          11.52   16.30

#### 6.2.5.2 Propagation model between TN BS and TN UE

Referring to section 7.4 in TR 38.901, the propagation model between TN
BS and TN UE can be summarized as below, which is same as RMa scenario.
It's noted we assume all TN UE are outdoor, therefore there is no indoor
distance and no O2I building penetration loss in simulation.

**Pathloss:**

The pathloss models are summarized in Table 6.2.5.2-1 and the distance
definitions are indicated in Figure 6.2.5.2-1 and Figure 6.2.5.2-2. Note
that the distribution of the shadow fading is log-normal, and its
standard deviation for each scenario is given in Table 6.2.5.2-1.

\- TX\_PWR is the transmitted power

\- G\_TX is the transmitter antenna gain (directional array gain)

\- G\_RX is the receiver antenna gain (directional array gain).

### 6.2.8 Performance metric

**For NR, the average throughput loss and 5%-ile throughput loss should
be less than 5%.**

**For ATG, the average throughput loss and 5%-ile throughput loss should
be less than 5%.**

**For synchronized scenario, when TN network as victim, the average
throughput loss should be calculated in each of the TN cells. Results
should be presented for the average throughput loss in the worst case TN
cell, and an average of the average throughput losses in all of the TN
cells in the cluster may also be presented. The details could be found
as following:**

5% and average in the whole network (When TN UL as victim, 5% and
average are 5% and average of the whole TN UL. When ATG as victim, 5%
and average are the 5% and average among all drops.)

5% and average of users within the cell with largest throughput loss for
the case of TN DL victim

For non-synchronized scenario, compared with ATG UE-to-TN UE CLI, ATG
BS-to-TN BS CLI is the dominate interference. So we only consider ATG
BS-to-TN BS CLI simulation and detailed performance metric is as below:

When TN gNB as victim, only focus on the TN sector with worst throughput
loss, 5% and mean among all drops

When ATG gNB as victim, 5% and mean among all drops.

### 6.2.9 Link level performance for NR ATG coexistence

The throughput of a modem with link adaptation can be approximated by an
attenuated and truncated form of the Shannon bound. (The Shannon bound
represents the maximum theoretical throughput than can be achieved over
an AWGN channel for a given SNIR). The following equations approximate
the throughput over a channel with a given SNIR, when using link
adaptation:

![](./media/image68.png)$\text{\ Throughput\ }\left( \text{SNIR} \right),\ bps/Hz\  = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNIR < \ SNIR_{\text{MIN}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \\
 \propto \bullet S\left( \text{SNIR} \right)\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNI}R_{\text{MIN}} \leq SNIR < SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\  \\
 \propto \bullet S\left( \text{SNI}R_{\text{MAX}} \right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNIR\  \geq \ SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

Where:

\- S(SNIR) Shannon bound, S(SNIR) =log~2~(1+SNIR) bps/Hz

\- α Attenuation factor, representing implementation losses

\- SNIR~MIN~ Minimum SNIR of the code set, dB

\- SNIR~MAX~ Maximum SNIR of the code set, dB

The parameters α, SNIR~MIN~ and SNIR~MAX~ can be chosen to represent
different modem implementations and link conditions. The parameters
proposed in Table 4.2.7-1 represent a baseline case, which assumes:

\- 1:1 antenna configuration

\- AWGN channel model

\- Link Adaptation (see Table 4.2.7-1 for details of the highest and
lowest rate codes)

\- No HARQ

Table 6.2.9-1: Parameters describing baseline Link Level performance for
5G NR

  Parameter        DL    UL    Notes
  ---------------- ----- ----- ----------------------------------------------
  α, attenuation   0.6   0.4   Represents implementation losses
  SNIR~MIN~, dB    -10   -10   Based on QPSK, 1/8 rate (DL) & 1/5 rate (UL)
  SNIR~MAX~, dB    30    22    Based on 256QAM 0.93(DL) & 64QAM 0.93 (UL)

Note that the parameters proposed in Table 4.2.7-1 are targeted for eMBB
coexistence scenario.

6.3 Co-existence simulation methodology
---------------------------------------

Adopt following simulation steps.

\- Step 1: Generate aggressor and victim networks.

\- One ATG site with one sector is dropped referring to clause 6.2.1.3

\- Deployment of terrestrial network (19 cells with wraparound) refers
to Table 6.2.1.2-1

\- The relationship between TN and ATG can refer to clause 6.2.1.1

\- Step2: UE associations

\- TN UE are generated randomly inside the TN network, make sure enough
TN UEs are associated to each TN sectors based on coupling loss.

\- Deployment of ATG UE refers to clause 6.2.1.3.

\- Step 3: Once association is done, round robin scheduling is used. BF
weights are adjusted to point to the LOS direction between BS/ATG BS-UE.
This is done for both victim and aggressor networks.

\- Step 4: Throughput is computed in the victim systems without
considering ACI as below:

$\text{Thput}_{\text{NO~ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack = f\left( \text{SINR}_{\text{ICI}} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N + I_{\text{ICI}}} \right)$,

where: $I_{\text{ICI}}$ is the inter-cell interference.

\- Step 5: Throughput is computed considering ACI as below:

$\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack = f\left( \text{SINR}_{ICI + ACI} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N + I_{\text{ICI}} + I_{\text{ACI}}} \right)$,

where: $I_{\text{ACI}}$ is the adjacent channel interference.

\- Step 6: RF parameters are determined based on the degradation cause
by ACI as below:

$$\text{Los}s_{\text{ACI}} = 1 - \frac{\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}}{\text{Thput}_{\text{SINGLE}}}$$

#### 6.4.2.2 Scenario 6: 4GHz TN UL interfering TN DL

The ATG BS -- TN BS cross link interference will dominate the
interference between ATG UE and TN UE, so the co-existence evaluation
for this scenario has been excluded considering low interference levels.

#### 6.4.2.3 Scenario 7: 4GHz TN DL interfering ATG UL

This scenario captures the co-existence results after evaluation from
all possible options. Here TN DL with both AAS subarray and non-subarray
model is interfering ATG UL deployed in rural macro environment.

#### 6.4.2.4 Scenario 8: 4GHz TN UL interfering TN DL

The ATG BS -- TN BS cross link interference will dominate the
interference between ATG UE and TN UE, so the co-existence evaluation
for this scenario has been excluded considering low interference levels.

#### 6.4.2.5 Scenario 13: 4GHz TN UL interfering TN DL

The ATG BS -- TN BS cross link interference will dominate the
interference between ATG UE and TN UE, so the co-existence evaluation
for this scenario has been excluded considering low interference levels.

#### 6.4.2.6 Scenario 14: 2GHz TN DL interfering ATG UL

This scenario captures the co-existence results after evaluation from
all possible options. Here TN DL with both AAS subarray and non-subarray
model is interfering ATG UL deployed in rural macro environment.

### 6.5.2 Non-Synchronized Scenarios

This sub-clause captures the summary of the co-existence studies for the
non-synchronized scenarios.

Two propagation models between ATG BS and TN BS has been considered. The
simulation results based on both models -- Free Space Path loss and RMa
model in TR 38.901 with hUT as 30m has been captured in the TR, serving
only as information for the readers. The models have the following
limitations as highlighted below and it's upto the readers discretion to
analyze based on their implementation --

\- Free Space Path Loss model

\- Interference may arise through a range of propagation mechanisms
whose individual dominance depends on climate, radio frequency, time
percentage of interest, distance, and path topography. Free space
modeling is one of such mechanism.

\- RMa model in TR 38.901 with updating hUT as 30m

\- The applicable range of User Terminal antenna height- hUT in the
proposed RMa Pathloss model is -

\- whereas in the simulations, hUT has been considered as 30m which is
above the limit.

\- The applicable maximum distance - d2D in the RMa Pathloss model is 10
km for LoS and 5km for NLoS, whereas in the simulations (also stated in
Table 6.2.1.2-1 in ATG Network Layout) is minimum distance of 20 km for
Non-subarray and 50 km for Sub-array and maximum distance of 100km for
both antenna models. This is again way above the limit questioning the
validity and accuracy of the model.

Considering the simulation results in Sub-clause 6.4.2 and the
highlighted above limitations, following observations are made based on
the propagation models

\- Optimistic isolation distances in the multiples of tens of
kilometres, based on RMa pathloss model in TR 38.901 with hUT as 30m,
when the angle between ATG BS boresight and nearest TN boresight in
azimuth are 0°, 30° and 60°.

\- Pessimistic isolation distances in the multiples of tens to multiples
of hundreds of kilometres, based on Free space Pathloss model, when the
angle between ATG BS boresight and nearest TN boresight in azimuth are
0°, 30° and 60°.

7 RF requirements
=================

7.1 ATG UE specific
-------------------

### 7.1.1 ATG UE power class and requirement type

Since the required power level for ATG might be varying in different
aircraft types and also in different frequency ranges, it's quite
difficult to focus on one specific power class for ATG UE from 3GPP
perspective, therefore 3GPP agreed to introduce the new capability for
ATG UE to indicate the rated maximum output power at maximum modulation
order and full PRB configurations and its capability report granularity
as 1dB. The range of its power limit are defined as following:

\- The lower limit of conductive MOP or TRP of ATG UE is 23 dBm

\- The upper limit of conductive MOP or TRP of ATG UE is 40 dBm

In addition, considering the implementation freedom for ATG UE(e.g. for
2 GHz, to use omni-directional antenna for ATG UE and for 4 GHz, to use
antenna array for ATG UE), therefore 3GPP RAN4 agreed to introduce two
ATG UE types to distinguish the antenna types for ATG UE.

### 7.1.2 Tx requirements

#### 7.1.2.1 Frequency error

The doppler frequency for ATG UE can be determined by,

$$f_{D}\  = \ \ cos\theta*\frac{v}{c}*f\_ c$$

Where,

\- f~D~ is Doppler frequency, f\_c is the carrier frequency, which is
set as 5GHz for n79.

\- v is the speed of the aircraft which is 1200km/h.

\- $\theta$ is the elevation angle between UE and gNB.

Since the potential maximum cell range is up to 200-300km \[2\] and the
normal commercial airplane altitude is 10km, the elevation angle is only
about 2\~3 degrees when UE doing initial access at cell edge. Then the
maximum DL doppler frequency is approaching 5.5kHz and the UL doppler
frequency compared to the configured UL central frequency is approaching
5.5kHz if without any compensation which may cause not negligible impact
for link performance and access successful rate. ATG UE needs to perform
frequency compensation. The frequency accuracy requirement will be
written assuming Doppler frequency pre-compensation.

The ATG BS coarse location information captured in SIB22 specified in TS
38.331 for ATG could be broadcasted for ATG UE to do frequency
compensation if necessary. UE shall rely on the ATG BS location
broadcasted by the IE *ATG-Config-r18* in ATG SIB22 in 38.331 if
pre-compensation is based on SIB22. Where, the *atg-gNB-Location-r18*
contains location information used as a reference location. The value of
the field is same as *Ellipsoid-Point* defined in TS 37.355 \[9\]. The
first/leftmost bit of the first octet contains the most significant bit.

#### 7.1.2.2 MOP requirements

For ATG UE, the maximum output power is declared at maximum modulation
order and full PRB configurations within the channel bandwidth of NR
carrier unless otherwise stated. The period of measurement shall be at
least one sub frame (1ms).

ATG UE implementations/antenna patterns might be varying for different
operating bands. The output power from the UE may depend on the aircraft
type and exact deployment scenario. Currently, there is a lack of
knowledge in 3GPP of the appropriate output power for an ATG UE
considering all design, regulatory constraints and potential avionics
device protection. For this reason, it is agreed that ATG UE is allowed
to declare the output power and signal it to the network. The lower
limit of conductive MOP or TRP declared by ATG UE is 23dBm. The upper
limit of conductive MOP or TRP declared by ATG UE is 40dBm. The
capability report granularity is 1dB.

#### 7.1.2.3 MPR/AMPR requirements

ATG UE is allowed to declare the output power at supported maximum
modulation order and full PRB configurations. Thus, MPR/AMPR
requirements are not needed as ATG UE can declare a lower power whenever
power back-off is needed. Additionally, when ATG UE indicate the maximum
output power under the specific conditions (the supported maximum
modulation order, full PRB configurations, SEM/spurious emission
requirements, regulation requirements and so on), the necessary power
back-off should be considered. In total, the power back-off has been
included in the declared maximum output power, so there is no need to
specify MPR/AMPR requirements for ATG UE.

#### 7.1.2.4 Configured transmitted power

The UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,f,c~
for carrier f of serving cell c in each slot. The configured maximum
output power P~CMAX,f,c~ is set within the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ with

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ = MIN {P~EMAX,c~, *P~MaxOutputPower~*}

P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ = P~EMAX,c~

where

P~EMAX,c~ is the value given by ATG specific *p-Max* IE or the field
*additionalPmax* of the *NR-NS-PmaxList IE*, whichever is applicable
according to TS 38.331\[7\];

*P~MaxOutputPower~* is the maximum UE output power at maximum modulation
order and full PRB configurations which is indicated by ATG UE
capability;

T~REF~ and T~eval~ are specified in Table 7.1.2.4-1. For each T~REF~,
the P~CMAX,L,c~ for serving cell c are evaluated per T~eval~ and given
by the minimum value taken over the transmission(s) within the T~eval~;
the minimum P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ over one or more T~eval~ is then applied for
the entire T~REF~.

Table 7.1.2.4-1: Evaluation and reference periods for Pcmax

  T~REF~                    T~eval~                   T~eval~ with frequency hopping
  ------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Physical channel length   Physical channel length   Min(*T~no\_hopping~*, Physical Channel Length)

The measured configured maximum output power P~UMAX,f,c~ shall be within
the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ -- T(P~CMAX\_L,f,c~) ≤ P~UMAX,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ +
T(P~CMAX\_H,f,c~).

where the tolerance T(P~CMAX,f,c~) for applicable values of P~CMAX,f,c~
is specified in Table 7.1.2.4-2.

Table 7.1.2.4-2: ATG P~CMAX~ tolerance

  P~CMAX,f,c~ (dBm)      Tolerance T(P~CMAX,f,c~) (dB)
  ---------------------- -------------------------------
  23 \< P~CMAX,c~ ≤ 40   2.0
  21 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ ≤ 23    2.0
  20 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< 21   2.5
  19 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< 20   3.5
  18 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< 19   4.0
  13 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< 18   5.0
  8 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< 13    6.0
  -19 ≤ P~CMAX,c~ \< 8   7.0

It's noted that T~L,c~ is not applicable for ATG UE compared to handheld
UE. In addition, the range of Pcmax is from -19dBm to 40dBm.

#### 7.1.2.6 Transmit OFF power

The current requirements for Transmit OFF power specified in clause
6.3.2 of TS 38.101-1 are applicable to ATG UE, i.e. -50dBm.

#### 7.1.2.7 Transmit ON/OFF time mask

The current requirements for Transmit ON/OFF time mask specified in
clause 6.3.3 of TS 38.101-1 are applicable to ATG UE.

#### 7.1.2.8 Power control

The current requirements for power control specified in clause 6.3.4 of
TS 38.101-1 are applicable to ATG UE.

#### 7.1.2.9 Transmit signal quality

Transmit signal quality include frequency error and transmit modulation
quality.

For frequency error, frequency pre-compensation is assumed for ATG UE.
The existing requirement defined for NTN UE in TS 38.101-5 \[7\] will be
reused as baseline.

**Regarding modulation scheme, QPSK/16QAM/64QAM will be supported as
mandatory. For 256QAM, there are some challenges for ATG due to large
propagation distance. While according to the evaluation for 2GHz and
4GHz in \[6\], the SNR above 25dB can still be seen in the considered
scenarios for both UL and DL. UL 256QAM is supported for ATG UE as
optional feature.**

Figure 7.1.2.9-2: received SNR for TDD 100MHz at 4GHz

For transmit modulation quality, the following requirement for FR1 UE in
38.101-1 \[4\] will be reused for ATG UE.

  Parameter   Unit   Average EVM Level
  ----------- ------ -------------------
  QPSK        \%     17.5
  16 QAM      \%     12.5
  64 QAM      \%     8
  256 QAM     \%     3.5

#### 7.1.2.10 Occupied bandwidth

The Occupied bandwidth requirement in subclause 6.5.1 of 38.101-1 \[4\]
is applicable for ATG UE operating in FR1.

#### 7.1.2.11 SEM requirements

ATG co-existence simulations results show the same ACLR value is
applicable for all output power levels. The higher output power level
the higher adjacent channel leakage level. So in theory, the higher
output power the more relaxed SEM requirements. For ATG, 31dBm is used
as the output power transition point to differentiate different SEM
requirements. Here 31dBm refers to output power of PC1 since handhold UE
spec specified the same SEM levels for all UEs up to PC1, i.e. 31dBm. If
the actual transmission power of ATG UE is less than or equal to 31dBm,
legacy spectrum emission mask requirements for handhold UE apply; if the
actual transmission power of ATG UE is larger than 31dBm, the
requirements of spectrum emission mask shall be relaxed with scaling
factor equal to (the actual transmission power minus 31) dB.

#### 7.1.2.12 ACLR requirements

FR1 PC3 ACLR requirement in 38.101-1 is reused for ATG CPE.

#### 7.1.2.13 Spurious emission

The general spurious emission requirement in subclause 6.5.3.1 of
38.101-1 \[4\] is applicable for ATG UE operating in FR1.

#### 7.1.2.14 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence

Given the separation distance between ATG UE and TN UE is quite large,
it is expected that the achievable MCL can be large enough to overcome
the UE-UE interference. This requirement will not be specified for ATG
UE.

#### 7.1.2.15 Transmit intermodulation

Transmit intermodulation is not applicable to ATG UE since terrestrial
interferance scenario is different from scenarios over the air.

### 7.1.3 Rx requirements

#### 7.1.3.1 General

Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at
the antenna connector(s) of the ATG UE. For CPE(s) with an integral
antenna only, a reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for
each antenna port(s). CPE with an integral antenna(s) may be taken into
account by converting these power levels into field strength
requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For CPEs with more than one
receiver antenna connector, identical interfering signals shall be
applied to each receiver antenna port if more than one of these is used
(diversity).

#### 7.1.3.2 Diversity characteristics

The CPE for ATG is required to be equipped with a minimum of two Rx
antenna ports in all the ATG operating bands in FR1.

#### 7.1.3.3 REFSENS requirements

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the CPE antenna ports, at which the throughput
shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference
measurement channel.

The same assumptions of NR FR1 handheld UE are used for NR ATG CEP in
ATG operating bands in FR1. Therefore, the reference sensitivity of NR
FR1 handheld UE could be reused for ATG UE.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2 and A.3.2
from TS 38.101-1 \[4\] (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1 from TS 38.101-1 \[4\]) with
parameters specified in Table 7.1.3.3-1a, Table 7.1.3.3-1b and Table
7.1.3.2.2-3

#### 7.1.3.4 Maximum input level

The calculation and results for maximum input level are listed in Table
7.1.3.4-1. The maximum input level is a compromise of the theoretical
worst-case which assumes the 5 dBi UE element gain under the condition
that the ATG UE antenna and BS antenna are not directly pointing to each
other.

Maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the
UE antenna port, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet
or exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference
measurement channel. For ATG, the maximum input level requirements are
defined in Table 7.1.3.4-2 based on two types of UE antenna, i.e.,
omni-directional antenna and phased array antenna.

#### 7.1.3.5 Adjacent channel selectivity

For ACS, the coexistence studies outcome shows that the legacy ACS
values as for NR FR1 UE are appropriate, and therefore reused.

The legacy ACS test parameters in case 1 is applied for ATG UE. ACS
requirements in case 2 shall be specified based on the maximum input
level of xdBm.

#### 7.1.3.6 In-band blocking requirements

**[Blocking due to TN interference]{.underline}**

Compared to terrestrial UE, ATG UEs are distant from base stations,
experiencing LoS path loss from the TN BS that is not directly pointed
at them. ATG UE at 2 GHz with omni-directional antennas, may receive
power from multiple TN BSs. Even at 4 GHz, an ATG UE pointing downwards
may still receive Rx power from the ground TN BS.

To evaluate the TN's blocking power, simulations are conducted based on
Scenario 3 and 11 (TN aggressor DL to ATG DL) and analyze the CDF of the
absolute Rx power received by the ATG UE from the TN. The simulation is
based on the following deployment scenarios: the ATG BS is located 300
km away from the center of the TN cluster and the ATG UEs x-coordinate
is uniformly distributed over the horizontal extent of the TN cluster.
The TN BSs utilize non-co-located 8-column non-subarray antennas. A
single 5 dBi gain element has been used at the ATG UE at 4 GHz while an
isotropic radiator is used at 2 GHz.

At a CDF of 99.999%, the simulation shows that the Rx power for a
uniform distribution of ATG UEs' altitude between 3 km and 10 km is -52
dBm and -56 dBm for 2 GHz and 4 GHz, respectively. For a fixed 10 km
case, the Rx power is quite similar. A 6 dB difference can be observed
in the fixed 3 km case, which is an unlikely scenario. Strictly
following the simulation suggests -52 dBm in-band blocking, but it is
essential to note that this relies on a 99.999% CDF. Lowering CDF to
99.99% is expected to yield lower interference at least several dB
lower.

Therefore, it is suggested to reuse the in-band blocking requirements in
TS 38.101-1 for ATG UE.

**[Blocking due to interference from another ATG network]{.underline}**

The co-existence simulations do not consider ATG-ATG co-existence. In
the case of in-band blocking, the involvement of neighboring operators
operating ATG could be significant. The most severe situation arises
when co-located ATG BS direct their beams toward aircraft that are
relatively close to each other and the BS. In such a case, the victim
ATG UE could still be in the vicinity of the beam of the aggressor BS.
Two scenarios are illustrated in 7.1.3.6-3, scenario 1 with two adjacent
aircrafts separated vertically by 300 m and scenario 2 with a 9.26 km
horizontal separation.

height="3.473611111111111in"}

Figure 7.1.3.6-3 Two scenarios when co-located BS pointing towards
different aircraft that are relatively close.

Considering the FAA regulations mandating minimum aircraft separations
of 300 m (1000 ft) vertically or 9.26 km (5 NM) horizontally in en-route
airspace, one can estimate the angular separation. The victim aircraft
could fall within the main lobe or the edge of the beam lobe towards the
aggressor aircraft. Assuming 20 km distance from the ATG BS to the
victim aircraft at a 10 km flight level, the angle separation is less
than 1 deg in Scenario 1 and 15.4 deg in Scenario 2.

In Scenario 1, the victim UE falls into the main lobe of the aggressor
beam. Determining the EIRP of the victim involves utilizing the ATG BS
output power from simulation parameters and accounting for free space
path loss. For an ATG UE operating at 2 GHz, the EIRP is calculated to
be - 72 dBm, significantly lower than the blocking caused by TN
interference. Furthermore, the 300 m vertical separation is an absolute
minimum distance and is very unlikely to occur during normal cruising in
the same direction.

Thus, it is not necessary to consider blocking from other ATG networks
when assessing the in-band blocking requirement.

#### 7.1.3.7 Out-of-Band blocking requirements/ Spurious response

Referring to the ITU-R M.2059-0 \[8\], Tables 1 and 2 of ITU-R M.2059-0
provide technical characteristics for representative analogue and
digital FMCW radio altimeters. In 3GPP, the ATG UE OOB specification is
defined to ensure the telecommunication link and there may be other
sources of interference and regulatory issues that need to be considered
when designing ATG UE, i.e. avionic equipment.

Thus, the existing out-of-band blocking requirements and spurious
response requirement (-44dBm) in TS 38.101-1 are used for ATG UE.

#### 7.1.3.8 Narrow band blocking requirements

It was agreed not to specify narrow band blocking requirements for ATG
UE.

#### 7.1.3.9 Intermodulation characteristics

*Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the receiver\'s
capability to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency
in the presence of two or more interfering signals with a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal.*

*It was agreed to reuse the intermodulation characteristics requirements
specified in TS 38.101-1 for ATG UE.*

#### 7.1.3.10 Receiver Spurious emissions

As this is regulatory requirements and referring to the ERC
Recommendation 74-01 Annex 3 \[3\], the spurious emissions limits
specified in sub-clause of TS 38.101-1\[4\] would also be applicable to
ATG UE.

7.2 ATG BS specific
-------------------

For most of the requirements, it was generally agreed to aim to reuse
the existing TN BS requirements for ATG BS wherever possible since the
TN BS requirements would provide the same or better BS performance for
an ATG BS deployment. The following section will capture the
considerations of ATG BS RF requirements.

### 7.2.1 ATG BS class and BS type

This WI study focus on FR1 bands only. After some discussion, the three
BS FR1 types are specified for ATG BS, i.e. ATG BS type type1-C, 1-H and
1-O are defined.

For the ATG BS class, the deployment scenarios were discussed. ATG BSs
are supposed to be deployed on the ground to serve ATG UEs (CPE type of
UE mounted in the aircraft) in the air. The flight altitude of ATG UE is
supposed to turn on is assumed from 3\~10km based on the regulatory
input and coexistence study. The distance between aircraft and the
nearest ATG BS in azimuth angle could be more than 200km and even up to
300km. So the scenario for ATG is different from existing scenarios for
TN BS and scenario for HAPS. Separate BS classes for ATG need to be
defined.

For ATG BS type type1-C, 1-H and 1-O, ATG BS class is defined as below:

*ATG Base Stations are characterized by requirements derived from ATG
scenarios with a ground BS to air UE with typical vertical altitude of
around 10,000m and take-off/landing altitudes down to 3000m.*

Generally most of the WA BS class requirements can be reused by ATG BS.
Some exceptions were found in the WI study, for example TAE requirement.
The detail requirements study and conclusion are captured in the
corresponding sections.

### 7.2.2 Tx requirements

#### 7.2.2.1 ATG Base station power 

**[Base station output power]{.underline}**

Considering the large coverage requirements of ATG system, only wide
area BS is proper for ATG BS type 1-C, type 1-H and type 1-O. Similar to
NR Wide area BS, there is no upper limit for the rated carrier output
power, maximum output power should be left up to the declaration. The
existing requirement defined in TS 38.104 \[5\] can be reused.

**[RE power control dynamic range]{.underline}**

The RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the power
of an RE and the average RE power for a BS at maximum output power for a
specified reference condition.

The RE power control dynamic range was derived by considering the
relation between RE power boosting/de-boosting and other RF requirements
like UEM, ACLR and EVM. For ATG BS, since the same waveform as NR is
used, the existing requirement defined in TS 38.104 \[5\] can be
applicable.

**[Total power dynamic range]{.underline}**

The BS total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum
and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition. It can be calculated by 10log10 (N~RB~). The Total
power dynamic range for ATG BS can reuse the requirement from TN BS in
3GPP TS 38.104 \[5\] for the same channel bandwidth.

#### 7.2.2.2 Transmitted signal quality

**[Frequency error]{.underline}**

Frequency error mainly depends on the timing and synchronization
performance and PLL performance within transceiver chain. ATG system is
expected to use the existing timing and synchronization network
directly. Meanwhile, similar PLL performance of ATG BS as NR BS is also
expected as they are operating at the same frequency range. With the
above considerations, frequency error requirement of NR can be reused
for ATG BS.

Considering the 0.05ppm BS frequency error, for 2100 MHz, it is 105 Hz.
For ATG system, UE velocity can be reach up 900-1200km/h at cruising
speed, it can be seen that the more serious frequency offset is caused
by the Doppler effect. The 0.05 ppm frequency offset has little impact
on the system performance.

**[Time alignment error]{.underline}**

For a specific set of NR signals/transmitter configurations/transmission
modes, the conducted Time Alignment Error (TAE) is defined as the
largest allowed timing difference (i.e. error) between two different
reference signals belonging to different antenna connectors (for 1-C
type NR BS), or *TAB connectors* (for 1-H type NR BS).

TAE is only applicable for NR BS transmitting from multiple antennas via
MIMO, CA, or combination of them.

However, in ATG system, BS transmits signals from the ground to the air.
Generally, these are only the main path signals, and few multipath
signals. Thus, it's unnecessary to specify the MIMO TAE requirements for
ATG BS. In addition, CA is not supported for ATG in Rel-18. As a result,
no TAE requirements need to be developed for ATG BS.

**[Modulation quality]{.underline}**

It is agreed to specify QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM and 1024QAM for ATG,
for the supported modulation order is up to the vendor's declaration.

For ATG BS, the EVM value of each carrier for different modulation
schemes on PDSCH in TS 38.104 \[5\] shall be met.

#### 7.2.2.3 Unwanted emission requirements

**[Occupied bandwidth]{.underline}**

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 (=0.5%) of the total mean
transmitted power. For ATG BS, it is agreed to reuse the same
requirement defined in TS38.104 \[5\] which is following Recommendation
ITU-R SM.328.

**[Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)]{.underline}**

Based on the coexistence simulation results, it is sufficient to reuse
the legacy FR1 ACLR 45dBc requirement for ATG BS..

**[Operating band unwanted emissions]{.underline}**

ATG BS can follow Wide Area BS, that the UEM level in the spurious
domain is aligned with ITU-R recommendation SM.329.

#### 7.2.2.4 Transmitter spurious emissions

Since transmitter spurious emissions for TN BS should meet the
requirements of ITU-R SM329, CEPT, and FCC etc., the spurious emission
requirement defined in TS 38.104 \[5\] for TN BS is sufficient for ATG.

The same spurious emission requirement defined in TS 38.104 \[5\] for TN
BS can be reused.

#### 7.2.2.5 Transmitter intermodulation

In the standard discussion, it\'s supposed that there's no surrounding
interfering BS with same bands existing for ATG BS. But some other
scenarios were identified, for example, interfering signals from other
bands or other asynchronous BS, also temporary interferers could occur
close to the ATG BS. Therefore, it was agreed that it is important to
verify that the ATG BS will still meet all emissions requirements,
including regulatory requirements robustly.

It was agreed that the Tx IM requirement in TS 38.104 \[5\] can be
reused to guarantee the performance of the ATG BS.

### 7.2.3 Rx requirements

#### 7.2.3.1 Reference sensitivity level

For reference sensitivity level because it is expected that the BS
technology will be the same and hence the noise factor the same. The
existing requirements specified in clause 7.2 of TS 38.104\[5\] can be
reused for ATG BS type1-C, 1-H, and clause 10.3 of TS 38.104\[5\] can be
reused for ATG BS type1-O.

#### 7.2.3.2 Dynamic range

For dynamic range because it is based on assumptions on the maximum
interference level around the BS. Detailed investigation has not been
made, but since the main difference between an ATG BS and TN BS is the
tilt, it is not expected to be greater and may be expected sometimes to
be similar to a TN BS. The existing requirements specified in clause 7.3
of TS 38.104\[5\] can be reused for ATG BS type1-C, 1-H, and clause 10.4
of TS 38.104\[5\] can be reused for ATG BS type1-O.

#### 7.2.3.3 ACS

The co-existence simulations demonstrate that if 46dBc ACS is applied
for BS in ATG scenarios then the cross operator interference is
acceptable (\<5% degradation) in all scenarios. It is desirable to apply
the same ACS as TN BS to maximize compatibility with BS hardware
platforms. Thus, based on the simulation results, the ATG adjacent
channel selectivity (ACS) reuse the existing FR1 ACS (i.e. 46dBc)
requirement applied for TN BS. The existing requirements specified in
clause 7.4 of TS 38.104\[5\] can be reused for ATG BS type1-C, 1-H, and
clause 10.5 of TS 38.104\[5\] can be reused for ATG BS type1-O.

#### 7.2.3.4 In-band blocking

Since ATG BS is supposed to steer its beam up towards to provide the
service for ATG UE in the air, the received power level of in-band
blocking would be also lower than that for the legacy TN BS with beam
steering down towards to provide the service on the ground. In addition,
considering that it's agreed to reuse the FR1 BS ACS requirement
\[46dBc\] for ATG BS, therefore it is also reasonable to reuse the
in-band blocking requirement for FR1 WA BS for ATG BS.

#### 7.2.3.5 Receiver intermodulation

Regarding the Rx intermodulation, although it is not likely to have the
coexistence scenario in which ATG BS is subject to intermodulation
interferers with the power levels defined in FR1 WA Rx intermodulation
requirement, Rx intermodulation still dimension some aspects of receiver
design (e.g. receiver linearity to minimize the interfering signal
intermodulation fall into the wanted signal). Therefore, it' s still
useful to keep the receiver intermodulation requirements and it is
agreed to reuse the Rx IM requirement for FR1 WA BS for ATG BS.

#### 7.2.3.6 Out of band blocking 

Since ATG BS is supposed to steer its beam up towards to provide the
service for ATG UE in the air, the received OOBB power level would be
also lower than that for the legacy TN BS with beam steering down
towards to provide the service on the ground, then it's sufficient to
reuse the existing OOBB requirement defined for Wide Area BS in
TS38.104.

#### 7.2.3.7 In-channel selectivity

Since the IoT level of ATG BS is supposed to quite low compared with IoT
level of the legacy TN BS. In addition, considering that noise figure
for WA BS and FRC could be reused for ATG BS, then it's sufficient to
reuse the existing requirement for Wide Area BS defined in TS 38.104.

8 RRM requirements
==================

8.1 General
-----------

In R18, the WI on ATG doesn't consider FR2, CA/DC and inter-RAT
measurement scenario, the corresponding requirements are not applicable
for R18 ATG. In light of ATG characteristics (e.g. ISD assumption of
\[14\]-200km, maximum UE speed of 1200km/h, maximum distance between UE
and BS is greater than \[200\]km), some RRM requirements are different
from legacy ground-based network requirements, as listed in table 8-1.

Editor's Note: In table 8-1, the RRM requirements with square brackets
are still under discussion, which may be updated according to the latest
agreements.

ground-based network requirements

For other RRM requirements, no new ATG specific requirements will be

9 Conclusion
============

RAN4 has performed the adjacent channel co-existence simulation between
ATG network and TN network under the synchronized operation and
non-synchronized operation assumptions. 4GHz and 2GHz are chosen as
example bands using antenna array and omni-directional antenna at ATG UE
side respectively.

\- The synchronized operation assumption is used to derive adjacent
channel co-existence RF requirements, i.e., ACLR and ACS. Two kinds of
layout have been conducted to simulate different location relationship
between ATG UE and TN network, one for ATG UE on top of TN network and
the other for ATG UE away from TN UE in azimuth. For adjacent channel
co-existence, RAN4 has concluded to reuse legacy FR1 TN BS and UE RF
requirements (i.e., ACLR and ACS) for ATG BS and UE, respectively.

\- The non-synchronized operation assumption is used to analyze
isolation distance between ATG BS and TN network based on derived ACLR
and ACS from synchronization operation. Moreover, a total of 3 cases
have been performed to describe different boresight relationship between
ATG BS and nearest TN BS. ATG BS point directly at nearest TN BS in
azimuth is the worst case. RAN4 conclusions for different propagation
conditions and modeling have been summarized in Section 6.5.

Besides, ATG specific operation bands are listed in clause 5 based on
request from operators. It's noted this TR only encompass FR1 operation
bands with larger than 1GHz frequency.

RAN4 also studied the UE RF, BS RF, UE RRM requirement in Chapter 7.1,
7.2 and 8 respectively. Two kinds of UE RF and RRM requirements have
been considered considering the implementation freedom for ATG UE with
omi-directional antenna and/or antenna array.

######## Annex A: Calibration results of synchronized operation

A.1 Calibration assumptions
---------------------------

The calibration assumptions is the same as listed in clause 6.2 and 6.3.

A.2 Calibration results at 2GHz and 4GHz
----------------------------------------

Four kinds of performance metrics are used for synchronized operation
calibration purpose which encompass Coupling Loss (CL), SINR without
adajcent channel interference, SINR with adjacent channel interference
from synchronized intra-system and SINR CDF with adjacent channel
interference from synchronized inter-system. Following show detailed
explanation for each performance metric in calibration excel file.

\- CL: coupling loss between transmitter and receiver

\- SINR CDF without adjacent channel interference: Here the
SINR=S/(N+I~ICI~) where I~ICI~ is the co-channel interference

\- SINR CDF with adjacent channel interference from synchronization
intra-system: Here the SINR=S/(N+I~ICI~ + I~ACI~).

\- For TN, I~ACI~ is from synchronized TN network using adjacent channel

\- For ATG, due to we only consider one ATG BS and UE, I~ACI~ and I~ICI~
are both 0

\- SINR CDF with adjacent channel interference from synchronization
inter-system: Here the SINR=S/(N+I~ICI~ + I~ACI~).

\- For TN, I~ACI~ is from synchronized ATG network using adjacent
channel

\- For ATG, I~ACI~ is from synchronized TN network using adjacent
channel and I~ICI~ is 0

The below linked sheet captures the data of calibration co-existence
simulation study for all synchronized scenarios. More details on the
assumptions can be found in the Cover page of the sheet.

######## Annex B: Calibration results of non-synchronized operation

B.1 Calibration assumptions
---------------------------

The calibration assumptions is the same as listed in clause 6.2 and 6.3.

B.2 Calibration results at 2GHz and 4GHz
----------------------------------------

For non-synchronized operation, the performance metric to be calibrated
would be the Cross coupling loss between ATG BS and TN BS with 0 azimuth
angle (TN and ATG BS on the same horizontal line). besides, 5 km
isolation distance is assumed between ATG BS and nearest TN BS.

The below linked sheet captures the data of calibration co-existence
simulation study for all non-synchronized scenarios.

######## Annex C: Co-existence scenarios simulation data

C.1 Synchronized scenarios
--------------------------

The below linked sheet captures the data of co-existence simulation
study for all synchronized scenarios. More details on the assumptions
can be found in the Cover page of the sheet.

C.2 Non-Synchronized scenarios
------------------------------

The below linked sheet captures the data of co-existence simulation
results for non-synchronized scenarios. More details can be found in the
Cover page of the sheet.

Note: Some companies opted to only capture the results in the form of
tables (Sub-clause 6.4.2)

######## Annex D: Supplementary simulation results for co-existence synchronized scenarios

This section comprises the additional simulation results captured during
the early discussions for extra robustness of the ATG system. The
simulation parameters are changed to check the influence on the
simulation results.

D.1 Synchronized scenarios
--------------------------

### D.1.1 Impact of the number of TN BS columns

To protect the legacy deployments, it is important to highlight that
8-column AAS may not be satisfactory for all deployments in 2 GHz. With
this consideration, this subsection points out the impact of the number
of antenna columns in the TN BSs for 2 GHz carrier frequency. The
results captured are for scenarios 9-12, where one and eight antenna
columns at the TN are assumed using both sub-array and non-subarray
configurations.

The linked excel sheet provides detailed plots for the Scenarios 9-12.

It's noted that the number of TN BS columns study adopts the acceptable
ACLR/ ACS values for all the scenarios. The 8-column cases seem to be
the worst ones. The simulations results show varied degradation in some
cases, but the variations don't make a large difference from the agreed
requirements. Overall, the one and eight column antennas still follow
the acceptable ACLR/ ACS requirements.

### D.1.2 Impact of ATG UE antenna type

This subsection points out the impact of the number of antenna array at
the ATG UEs for 4 GHz frequency. The results captured are for scenarios
1-4, where 16x1 and 8x2 antenna array are compared.

The linked excel sheet provides detailed plots for the Scenarios 1-4.

It's noted the ATG UE antenna type study adopts the acceptable ACLR/ ACS
values for all the scenarios The 16x1 and 8x2 antenna array options have
minimal differences in Scenarios 1,2 and 4 for 4 GHz frequency. However,
in Scenario 3, 16x1 antenna array seems to be the worst case for 5%
throughput loss level. Though the differences are not that significant
that would impact any of the acceptable ACLR/ ACS requirements as per
the agreements.

the whole network

### D.1.3 Impact of ATG-TN BS antennas collocation

This subsection points out the impact of the TN and ATG BS collocation
to identify the worst cases. The collocated deployments are the ones in
which the ATG BS is located inside the TN cluster and the horizontal
distance between ATG BS and ATG UE is in the range of \[20, 100\] km.
Similarly, the non-collocated deployments are the ones in which the ATG
BS is located 300 km away from the center of the TN cluster and ATG UEs
x-coordinate is uniformly distributed over the horizontal extent of the
TN cluster.

The linked excel sheet provides detailed plots for the Scenarios 2,3,10
and 11.

It's noted that the ATG-TN BS collocation study adopts the acceptable
ACLR/ ACS values with the non-collocated deployment option as the worst
case for most of the scenarios. In scenarios where it is observed the
other way round, the differences are not that significant that would
impact any of the acceptable ACLR/ ACS requirements as per the
agreements.

### D.1.4 mpact of ATG UE height distribution

This subsection points out the impact of the ATG UE height distribution.
The results shown are for cases when ATG UEs are uniformly distributed
between 3 and 10 km heights, all ATG UEs have a fixed height of 3 km and
all ATG UEs have a fixed height of 10 km.

The linked excel sheet provides detailed plots for the Scenarios 1-4 and
9-12.

It's noted that the ATG height distribution studied adopts the
acceptable ATG ACLR/ ACS requirements in most of the scenarios. However,
in scenarios 3 and 11 (as shown below), 3 km is the worst case, and the
ATG UE ACS level is way above the accepted level of 33 dB.

[\[CHART\]]{.chart}

Figure D.1.4-2: Simulation results for Throughput Loss - 5% of users in
the whole network

It is possible that ATG UE suffers degradation during take-off and
landing i.e., at 3 km. A certain throughput loss higher than 5% maybe be
acceptable, as far as the ATG network doesn't break off when ATG UEs are
at a height of 3 km.
