result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

4 Background
============

The present document is a technical report on NR carrier aggregation
band combinations with two SUL cells under Rel-18 timeframe. The
document covers each band combination specific issues (i.e. one
sub-clause defined per band combination)

4.1 Background information
--------------------------

NR CA band combinations with SUL band were introduced from Rel-16. In
Rel-16, intra-band CA with SUL band combination was supported, and the
CA configuration was extended to inter-band CA with SUL band combination
in Rel-17.

With fast deployment of 5G in China, more spectrum currently utilized by
GSM, UMTS and LTE will be evolved into NR deployment recently. As an
example, 1.9GHz and 2GHz TDD bands are previously used by 4G and 3G,
which are specified as NR TDD bands n39 and n34 in Rel-15 and also
specified as SUL bands n98 and n95 in Rel-16 and Rel-17 respectively.
The spectrum for these two bands themselves are not very large, thus
single SUL band may not fully comply with the fast increased UL usage
demanded by the operator. Therefore, NR CA configurations with two SUL
band combinations, i.e. two SUL bands in two cells together with other
TDD NR band(s), are emerging as a prospective solution for operators.
Similarly, 700MHz, 850MHz, 900MHz, 1.8GHz and 2.1GHz bands defined as
SUL bands n83, n89, n81, n80 and n84 in which 2 SUL bands in conjunction
with NR TDD bands, e.g. n78, n79 are highly interested by operators
holding the spectrum to boost the wide band UL performance.

It is known that SUL band combination includes one SUL band and one NR
band in a single cell. Aggregating a SUL band combination with another
NR band and follow CA framework to specify the band combination specific
requirements was already supported in previous SUL basket WI. However,
the current SUL basket WI only considers one SUL band. To address the
specific spectrum demand by operators, it is preferred to have a
dedicated spectrum WI for NR CA combinations with two SUL cells that
follow CA framework specified by both RAN1 and RAN4 specifications.

In addition, since both SUL bands and NR TDD bands could support
different power classes, the requirements for NR CA with two SUL cells
should cover at least PC3 and PC2 cases in Rel-18.

4.2 WI objective
----------------

The objectives of the core part are as follows:

\- Specify the PC3 band-combination specific RF requirements for the
listed CA configurations with two SUL cells including at least

\- Applicable frequencies if necessary

\- Applicable bandwidths and bandwidth sets if necessary

\- Analyse combinations that have self-desensitization due to following
reasons:

\- TX Harmonic and/or intermodulation overlap of receive band

\- TX signal overlap of receiver harmonic frequency

\- TX frequency being in close proximity of one of the receive bands

\- Any other identified reasons such that insufficient cross band
isolation, harmonic mixing

\- For the combination where self-desensitization exists, specify at
least needed

\- ∆T~IB,\ c~ and ∆R~IB,\ c~

\- Reference sensitivity exceptions including MSD test cases

**- Exceptions** to the out-of-band blocking requirement

4.3 TR Maintenance
------------------

A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the
contact person of each band/band combination to ensure that the TPs
related to the band/band combination have been implemented.

+--------------+--------------+---------+--------------+--------------+

### 5.5.3 Maximum output power

For UL configuration CA\_n78C, the requirement in clause 6.2A.1.1 from
38.101-1 is applicable.

For other UL configurations, the requirement for each band in clause
6.2.1 from 38.101-1 is applicable.

### 5.5.4 Spurious emission band UE co-existence

There is only single UL band in uplink so the requirement for each band
in clause 6.5.3.2 from 38.101-1 is applicable.

### 5.5.5 REFSENS requirements

For SUL operation with CA, the reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS)
requirement for downlink bands specified in clause 7.3A.2 from TS
38.101-1 is applicable.

Since the 2^nd^ harmonic interference of SUL band n80 may fall into the
Rx band n78, the MSD due to harmonic interference should be taken care
of. The REFSENS requirements can refer to the MSD due to harmonic
interference between SUL band n80 and n78 which has been specified in
Table 7.3C.2-2, if harmonic interference need to be considered.

### 5.5.6 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

### 5.6.3 Maximum output power

For UL configuration CA\_n78C, the requirement in clause 6.2A.1.1 from
38.101-1 is applicable.

For other UL configurations, the requirement for each band in clause
6.2.1 from 38.101-1 is applicable.

### 5.6.4 Spurious emission band UE co-existence

There is only single UL band in uplink so the requirement for each band
in clause 6.5.3.2 from 38.101-1 is applicable.

### 5.6.5 REFSENS requirements

For SUL operation with CA, the reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS)
requirement for downlink bands specified in clause 7.3A.2 from TS
38.101-1 is applicable.

Since the 4^th^ harmonic interference of SUL band n81 may fall into the
Rx band n78, the MSD due to harmonic interference should be took care
of. The REFSENS requirements can refer to the MSD due to harmonic
interference between SUL band n81 and n78 which has been specified in
Table 7.3C.2-2, if harmonic interference need to be considered.

### 5.6.6 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values

For CA\_n78\_n81-n84, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are given in the
tables below referring to CA\_n1-n8-n78.
